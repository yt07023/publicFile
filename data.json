        "text": "A small army of waiters, deliverymen and busboys who worked at a Mott Street dim sum joint sued their boss earlier this year for cheating them out of wages \u2014 and they won.\nBut collecting on the $943,000 that Joy Luck Palace was ordered to pay them in September has been harder than winning the federal lawsuit.\nIn fact, not a single worker has received a cent, they told the Daily News.\nJin Ming \"Vincent\" Cao, 36, is one of the 19 workers who sued the restaurant's owners and operators. He was working as a waiter at Joy Luck Palace in June 2018 when the management abruptly stopped paying wages. He and his colleagues stayed on working for tips, but then, two months later, the restaurant closed down.\n\"We realized we weren't going to get our wages so we decided to do something,\" he said.\nThey filed a lawsuit and won a judgement of $943,000. Cao's portion of that is $64,285 \u2014 which he has yet to receive. That's because, according to Cao, the restaurant's owners and operators had plenty of time to hide their assets as the lawsuit ground to a conclusion.\nThomas Power, the attorney for the stiffed workers, noted that the defendants did not show up for any of the litigation.\n\"It's fair to suspect that they have taken some steps to move their assets,\" he said.\nFor workers living in the Empire State, this kind of story is far too common.\nAccording to a 2014 U.S. Department of Labor report, workers in New York are cheated out of anywhere between $500 million and $1 billion in wages a year.\nAnother study \u2014 conducted by the National Center for Law and Economic Justice in 2015 \u2014 found that even when workers prevail in wage theft cases, more than $126 million due to them in New York State has not been paid out.\nThe study found there was $25 million in unpaid cash stemming from civil lawsuits throughout the state and $101 million in outstanding debt that the state Labor Department determined employers owed their workers, but that it was unable to collect.\nIn 2019 alone, people filed about 5,800 lawsuits in New York federal courts involving the Fair Labor Standards Act, which covers minimum and overtime wage claims, as well as workplace retaliation.\nBut even when workers win those cases, they often have to struggle to track down the money they're owed from companies, which in many cases shut down in order to hide assets.\n\"There are employers who employ wage theft to set up a competitive advantage,\" said Richard Blum, an attorney with the Legal Aid Society. \"Hiding it comes in the form of shifting assets.\"\nTo remedy that, advocates like Blum and Sarah Ahn, director of the Flushing Workers Center, are pushing for the enactment of the SWEAT Act, which would give workers an alternative to filing lawsuits.\n\"It would give workers the ability to walk into their county clerk's office and apply a lien,\" Ahn said.\nThe NYC Hospitality Alliance, which represents the restaurant industry, has opposed certain aspects of the proposal. The Alliance declined to comment to The News for this article, instead referring to a previous statement which outlines some compromises on the legislation and its lingering \"concerns with the premise\" of the SWEAT Act.\nIn other states, similar policies are already in effect. In California and Wisconsin, laborers have the ability to file liens against their bosses if they don't cough up what they're owed.\nFor years, efforts to pass such legislation in New York stalled in the Republican-controlled state Senate. But last session, the bill passed in a chamber now controlled by Democrats. The bill is awaiting Gov. Cuomo's review."

        "text": "Rep. Ilhan Omar has come under fire and been accused of anti-Semitism after sharing a tweet implying that American billionaire investor Leon Cooperman is backing Michael Bloomberg for president simply because he is Jewish. \nThe Democratic Congresswoman from Minnesota was slammed after she retweeted a news post announcing Cooperman will endorse fellow billionaire Bloomberg if he runs for president. \nShe shared the tweet saying: 'I wonder why' with a thinking face emoji.  \nThe tweet reignited accusations of anti-Semitism against the liberal Congresswoman, with critics saying it was a thinly veiled jab at their Jewish faith rather than their status as billionaires. \nCooperman said he will support former New York Mayor Bloomberg if he enters the 2020 Democratic primary for presidency. However, Bloomberg is yet to formally announce his presidential campaign.  Reports say he is actively preparing to enter the primary and is expected to file the paperwork this week. \n'I suppose you think it's all about the Benjamins,' Michael Dickson, the executive director of Stand With Us, a group that fights anti-Semitism, said in response. 'We get your insinuation. True to form.' \n'Omar very carefully making an anti-Semitic tweet with just enough vagueness to claim that ackshually [sic] she meant it was about the benjamins and not about religion. But everyone knows what she meant, which is why she continues to do it,' Twitter user Josh Jordan wrote. \nHowever, many were quick to come to Omar's defense saying her critics were honing in on the wrong facts. \nShe shared a tweet defending her saying: 'Oh for God's sake, stop this ridiculousness. This obsession with every word Ilhan says or tweets is tired and it's getting old.' \nShe shared another by Twitter user Leah Greenberg, who accused critics of twisting Omar's words. \n'Extremely this. The latest effort to twist @IlhanMN's words and impute anti-semitism to what's obviously a pretty standard observation about billionaires sharing similar political views is outrageous. It should be given no credence whatsoever.''\nOne critic responded saying: 'There is no effort to twist anything and you know this. Dogwhistles are called like that on purpose and have meaning behind it. At the same time there are news on Bezos who chatted with Bloomberg, but she picks another billionaire who happens to be Jewish.'\nSome social media users pointed out that Omar has endorsed Bernie Sanders, who is Jewish, for president in the upcoming election.  \nIn March this year Omar was accused of anti-Semitism at the Council of American Islamic Relations in Washington D.C. when she downplayed the 9/11 terror attacks saying 'some people did something.'\nBack in 2012 she shared a post claiming that 'Israel has hypnotized the world' during the conflict in Gaza, drawing upon an anti-Semitic trope. \nThroughout her time in office she has been vocal in her criticism of the Israeli government, has voiced support for a two-state solution in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, and backed a boycott of Israel by supporting the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) movement. \nHer backing of the BDS movement led Israel's government to ban her and Rep. Rashida Tlaib from entering the country in August 2019. \nHowever, Omar has defended herself in the past against these accusations of anti-Semitism. \nIn February she shared a post saying: 'Anti-Semitism is real and I am grateful for Jewish allies and colleagues who are educating me on the painful history of anti-Semitic tropes.'\n'My intention is never to offend my constituents or Jewish Americans as a whole. We have to always be willing to step back and think through criticism, just as I expect people to hear me when others attack me for my identity. This is why I unequivocally apologize,' she added.  "

        "title": "As Bloomberg's New York Prospered, Inequality Flourished Too",
        "text": "Michael Bloomberg has a dramatic story to tell of New York City's transformation should he decide to enter the presidential race. The city was in recession and reeling from the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks when Mr. Bloomberg became mayor in 2002. By the time he left three terms later, vast stretches of New York had been redeveloped, with new parks, office towers, stadiums, employers and taxpaying residents where there were once blighted properties and industrial land.\nThat story of New York's success under Mr. Bloomberg, however, is also for many critics a story about inequality. If the mayor wants to emphasize the first theme in a bid for president, the second one will invariably chase after him.\nAnd in an election in which the candidates are already focused heavily on inequality \u2014 between prosperous coastal cities and Middle America, between billionaires and working-class residents, between luxury high-rises and the homeless \u2014 Mr. Bloomberg, himself a billionaire, appears headed for criticism on several fronts.\nThe city he turned over to Bill de Blasio in 2014 was increasingly caricatured as a playground for the rich. Slender new skyscrapers on Billionaire's Row had begun to cast shadows on Central Park. Neighborhoods that had seen little investment in years were bracing for gentrification. Income inequality ranked among the widest of major cities in America, and by the 2013 election to replace Mr. Bloomberg, Mr. de Blasio's \"tale of two cities\" campaign was squarely focused on it.\nAll of that was somewhat miraculous given the situation when Mr. Bloomberg took office.\n\"After the attack, people thought New York had no future,\" said Mitchell Moss, a professor of urban policy and planning at N.Y.U. \"There was a genuine sense that, \u2018Who would want to live in New York, who would want to work in New York, who would want to visit New York?'\"\nIn the years that followed, Mr. Bloomberg introduced an ambitious plan to preserve or build 165,000 units of affordable housing, and he oversaw the most extensive rezoning in modern city history. His administration rezoned about 40 percent of the city, paving the way for increased density and development in old industrial waterfront neighborhoods like Williamsburg and Greenpoint in Brooklyn.\n\"There's this sense that the Bloomberg administration was about mega projects,\" said Rafael Cestero, who led the Department of Housing Preservation and Development during part of the Bloomberg years. Mr. Cestero countered that many of those units of affordable housing were less visible but formed a more fundamental legacy. \"We talk in these vagueries of units and developments and dollars and money. And the reality is that 500,000 people in our city are living more affordably because of the work that Mayor Bloomberg did over 12 years.\"\nAs those homes were built or saved, the cost of housing in the city kept climbing. Median rents rose in New York by 19 percent, in real dollars, between 2002 and 2011, as the real median income of renter households declined slightly, according to a report by the Furman Center at N.Y.U. The number of residents in homeless shelters grew to 50,000 a night from less than 30,000.\n\nNew York's growth and prosperity \u2014 seen at Atlantic Yards-Barclays Center; in Greenpoint; in Long Island City \u2014 appeared inseparable from the rising affordability crisis."

But the Army officer also detailed a previously undisclosed discussion in the Oval Office on Aug. 16, a conversation among senior leaders that he did not witness but understood to be aimed at persuading Trump to restore the flow of hundreds of millions of dollars in security aid to Ukraine.\nThose involved included national security adviser John Bolton, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Secretary of Defense Mark T. Esper, Vindman said. They gathered with Trump \"to discuss the hold and other issues\" after Bolton instructed Vindman to draft a memo for the president explaining why distribution of the security aid \u2014 totaling almost $400 million \u2014 was in the United States' interests.\nVindman told lawmakers that there was broad agreement among national security officials that not providing the aid to Ukraine \"would significantly undermine the message of support\" for the country and \"also signal to the Russians that they could potentially be more aggressive.\"\nBut accounts of what transpired in the Oval Office varied, Vindman told impeachment investigators. One official told him that, inexplicably, the hold on military aid \"never came up,\" according to Vindman's testimony. A second account indicated that it was raised, \"but no decision was taken.\""

The announcement video was not finished until the middle of the night, and an email with instructions for Day 1 was sent to a small inner circle at 2:48 a.m.\nIt may not have been pretty, but former Gov. Deval Patrick of Massachusetts began a self-acknowledged long-shot bid for the Democratic presidential nomination on Thursday, filing paperwork for the primary here less than three months before the votes will be cast.\n\"I recognize running for president is a Hail Mary under any circumstances,\" Mr. Patrick told reporters at the New Hampshire state house. \"This is a Hail Mary from two stadiums over.\"\nMr. Patrick's entry comes as former New York City mayor Michael R.

        "text": "The White House and congressional Republicans have seized on the lack of witnesses with firsthand knowledge of President Trump's actions on Ukraine to try to undermine the case for impeachment, a gambit that Democrats argue could backfire as more witnesses come forward.\nTrump administration officials and GOP lawmakers are arguing that career diplomats testified that they never spoke directly to Trump \u2014 and therefore cannot say with confidence that he tried to strong-arm a U.S. ally into doing him political favors.\n\"Their understanding, which is the foundation of the case for the Democrats, was based on secondhand information,\" House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) told reporters Thursday, referencing the two witnesses at the first open impeachment hearing Wednesday.\nThe strategy, however, is extremely risky for the president and the GOP. While it is true that the diplomats testified that they were told by others that Trump pressured Ukraine, a witness with firsthand information \u2014 Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman, who was on the Trump call \u2014 is scheduled to testify next week. And former national security adviser John Bolton also could talk to investigators.\nAdditionally, if Republicans were so concerned about secondhand accounts, Democrats say, they should allow Trump associates who do have firsthand information \u2014 acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney and Energy Secretary Rick Perry, for example \u2014 to testify, rather than blocking them. The White House has no plan, however, to do that, according to a senior administration official who spoke on the condition of anonymity to talk frankly.\n\"If you don't like hearsay, release the documents; if you don't like hearsay, let people testify!\" said Rep. Mike Quigley (D-Ill.). \"They're afraid of the testimony they have already seen, and there's a reason that they don't want the rest of this to get out.\"\nThe new talking point drastically raises the stakes for next week's hearing with Ambassador to the European Union Gordon Sondland, who told at least four Trump officials that the president personally oversaw the entire operation. On Friday, David Holmes, the top political affairs officer at the U.S. Embassy in Ukraine, is scheduled to testify behind closed doors about a July 26 conversation he overheard between Sondland and Trump about the investigations Trump was demanding from Ukraine.\nSondland, however, told lawmakers that he never talked to Trump about leveraging military aid and a head of state meeting with Ukraine on a promise to investigate Hunter Biden, son of former vice president and 2020 presidential candidate Joe Biden, a major discrepancy he will be pushed to clear up next week.\nAmbassador's cellphone call to Trump from Kyiv restaurant was a stunning breach of security, former officials say\nSondland's testimony could be damaging for Trump should he confirm his contacts with the president, Democrats say. It could also undermine their case should he deny Trump's involvement.\n\"Let me say to my friends about hearsay \u2026 the case is being built,\" warned Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee (D-Tex.). \"These were the two first witnesses. \u2026 Next week Ambassador Sondland will be asked and he will have to answer: \u2018Were you on that call? What was said on that call?' Under oath.\"\nThe GOP's strategic decision to focus on \"secondhand\" accounts was evident during testimony Wednesday from William B. Taylor Jr., the acting ambassador to Ukraine, and George Kent, the deputy assistant secretary of state responsible for Ukraine. Republicans, who have been scrambling for weeks to coalesce around a unified defense strategy, quickly realized that framing Trump's request for investigations as an attempt to root out corruption were not breaking through, according to Republicans who spoke on the condition of anonymity to speak frankly."

        "text": "A meme that misleadingly rephrased the words of Sen. Elizabeth Warren \u2014 one of 17 candidates seeking the Democratic nomination for president \u2014 has been stoking outrage online over immigration laws. One meme featuring the bogus quote has been shared more than 100,000 times and has gathered 1,800 comments since it was posted on Facebook on Oct. 20.\nThe meme includes two pictures of Mollie Tibbetts, a University of Iowa student who was killed in the summer of 2018 and became the subject of national attention when a Mexican immigrant was charged with her murder. Although her family asked that she be left out of the immigration debate, that request hasn't been honored by some social media users.\nThe text of the meme says: \"So Elizabeth Warren was asked about Mollie Tibbetts being murdered by an illegal immigrant\u2026.. Her reply was: \u2018I know this is hard for her family, but they have to remember that we need to focus on real problems like illegal immigrants not being able to see their kids'\"\nThe quote appears to be based loosely on something Warren said in August 2018, but it is selectively edited, reworded and used out of context to distort Warren's position.\nSome context about what was happening at the time is helpful in understanding Warren's remark: Earlier that year, the Trump administration had instituted a \"zero-tolerance\" immigration policy that resulted in children being separated from their parents who were detained at the border for entering the U.S. illegally. By June, the impact of that policy had erupted into one of the biggest news stories of the year, and President Donald Trump reversed course with an executive order calling for families to be kept together in custody. Coverage of the fallout from that policy continued over the summer.\nThen Tibbetts' body was found on Aug. 21, 2018. The next day, Warren was a guest on CNN's \"New Day.\" According to a transcript of the show, this is the exchange she had with host John Berman:\nBerman, CNN's \"New Day,\" Aug. 22, 2018: I want to get one last question in here \u2014\nWarren: Sure.\nBerman: \u2014 because it's a very important story in the news. It has to do with Mollie Tibbetts, the young woman in Iowa who was murdered. Her body believed to be found yesterday. A person has been charged with it. This person is an undocumented immigrant.\nMike Pence and the president have suggested the immigration laws need to be stronger so that people like this man who was accused of this murder were not in the country. Your reaction?\nWarren: You know, my \u2014 I'm so sorry for the family and I know this is hard not only for the people in her community, the people throughout Iowa.\nBut one of the things we have to remember is we need an immigration system that is effective, that focuses on where real problems are.\nLast month, I went down to the border and I saw where children had been taken away from their mothers, I met with their mothers who had been lied to, who didn't know where their children were, who hadn't had a chance to talk to their children, and there was no plan for how they would be reunified with their children.\nI think we need immigration laws that focus on people who pose a real threat and I don't think mamas and babies are the place we should be spending our resources. Separating a mama from a baby does not make this country safer.\nA clip from that part of the show has also been posted to YouTube by the Republican National Committee on its \"GOP War Room\" channel, where the video continues to generate comments like, \"The Tibet's family is separated from their baby you hypocritical bitch.\"\nSome viewers appear to have overlooked the part where Warren said, \"I think we need immigration laws that focus on people who pose a real threat,\" whom she said were not the \"mamas and babies\" being separated at the border. Warren did not say that violence by people in the U.S. illegally was not a \"real problem,\" as the false quote suggests.\nEditor's note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations working with Facebook to debunk misinformation shared on social media.

Elizabeth Warren.\nRyan took another implicit shot at their more liberal candidacies Wednesday, advocating an ideological middle ground and emphasizing the need to oust Trump from office as the party's priority.\n\"I know a lot of candidates and people are talking about, \u2018We want a revolution. We want to have big changes. We want to save the environment.' The best thing we could do \u2026 to have a revolution in the United States is to get rid of Donald Trump,\" he said.\n\"To me, it's clear as you go round and round and think about all of these great candidates, that that's Joe Biden,\" Ryan added. \"And I'm going to support him. I'm going to do everything I can for him in the early states and in the Midwest to help him become the nominee and beat Donald Trump.\""

        "title": "Report: Election vendors are 'prime targets,' need oversight",
        "text": "The private companies that make voting equipment and build and maintain voter registration databases lack any meaningful federal oversight despite the crucial role they play in U.S. elections, leaving the nation's electoral process vulnerable to attack, according to a new report.\nThe Brennan Center for Justice on Tuesday issued the report, which calls on Congress to establish a framework for federal certification of election vendors. The authors say this could be established as a voluntary program similar to how voting machines are certified, with incentives for state and local election officials to use vendors that have completed the process. It would include the establishment of federal standards and the ability for federal officials to monitor compliance and address any violations.\nThe report's co-author Lawrence Norden acknowledged it was too late for any of this to happen in time for the 2020 presidential election.\n\"Even if (Congress) had the will, it couldn't be passed in time,\" said Norden, director of the Election Reform Program at the Brennan Center. \"This is another security vulnerability that Congress hasn't addressed.\"\nNorden said congressional inaction has increased the pressure on state and local election officials to secure their voting systems and have measures in place should something go wrong. Although Congress sent $380 million to states last year for election security, Norden said it was a \"drop in the bucket\" of what is needed as state and local election officials look to fund the replacement of outdated and insecure voting systems, increase cybersecurity personnel and add security upgrades.\nThe Brennan Center, which is based at New York University School of Law, said the most logical agency to handle federal oversight of election vendors would be the U.S. Election Assistance Commission. But that agency has been hobbled in recent years by reduced federal funding and leadership vacancies.\nAlthough two commissioners were added this year, the agency is searching for a new executive director and general counsel.\nThe report acknowledges the commission does not have the authority that would allow it to certify election vendors. But the commission could take steps through its existing certification program for voting systems to ask vendors to provide details on cybersecurity practices and ownership information, according to the report. There have been concerns about foreign ownership of election companies operating in the United States.\n\"Private vendors' central role in American elections makes them prime targets for adversaries,\" the report said. \"Yet it is impossible to assess the precise level of risk associated with vendors or how that risk impacts election security.\"\nThe report notes that just three companies provide more than 80% of voting systems in the U.S. and that other systems like voter registration databases and electronic pollbooks are also supplied and, in some case, maintained by vendors.\nA report by The Associated Press last year found the leading voting-related companies had long skimped on security in favor of convenience and operate under a shroud of financial and operational secrecy despite their critical role in elections.\nFederal officials have sought to boost communications and information sharing through the formation of a group that brings together representatives of the Department of Homeland Security and election vendors. This includes the major firms of Election Systems and Software, Dominion Voting Systems and Hart InterCivic.\nThere are also efforts to develop a program that would allow authorized security researchers access to election equipment so vulnerabilities within election systems can be identified and addressed. The industry, historically opposed to such outside reviews, has signaled a willingness to explore this. All the major firms have sought to reassure the public and election officials that it takes security seriously, but experts say it's difficult to confirm given the limited visibility into their operations.\nA spokeswoman for Election Systems and Software said the company \"fully supports\" additional oversight and increased security testing of elections equipment, adding the company has submitted its equipment to testing by independent security researchers.\n\"ES&S agrees that all vendors should be held accountable for following best practices for all aspects of security, as ES&S does, and agrees that vendors should be American owned and operated, as ES&S is,\" said spokeswoman Katina Granger.\nThe report noted that other industries also viewed as critical to national security, such as defense contractors, face substantial oversight and must comply with various requirements.\nNorden said much of the focus within election security has been on the machines and how best to secure them but critical questions remain about how secure the vendors themselves are. He noted that former special counsel Robert Mueller described in his report how Russian agents in 2016 targeted employees of a voting technology company and installed malware on the company's network. Details on the extent of the breach have not been made public.\n\"Vendors are responsible for election security in a way that folks probably don't understand,\" Norden said. \"When we talk about election security, we talk about what election officials are doing, but we've left this big part of the puzzle out of the discussion.\""

        "text": "As the Congressional impeachment inquiry goes public this week, prosecutors in New York are quietly continuing to investigate an alleged covert plan involving Ukrainian government officials and associates of Rudy Giuliani to remove Marie Yovanovitch, the former U.S. ambassador to that country, sources told ABC News.\nIn recent weeks, a former congressman caught up in the scandal and who's now cooperating with federal investigators has been asked about any role he might have played in removing Yovanovitch, a key figure in the ongoing impeachment proceedings.\nThe recent indictments of the two Giuliani associates, Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman, claim at a critical period, during the spring and summer of 2018, the two men embarked on a plan to raise $20,000 for a congressmen whom they wanted to help get Yovanovitch removed.\nFederal prosecutors claim Parnas and Fruman, two Florida-based businessmen from the former Soviet Union, were working to remove Yovanovitch at the request of Ukrainian government officials.\nThe congressman has been identified as former House member Pete Sessions of Texas. The two men also contributed $350,000 to a SuperPAC that spent roughly $3 million for Sessions during the 2018 election cycle.\nFederal authorities claim Parnas met with the Sessions to secure his \"assistance in causing the U.S. government to remove or recall the then-ambassador to the Ukraine,\" Yovanovitch. Sources told ABC News that Sessions wrote a letter to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo asking that he consider \"terminating\" Yovanovitch's \"ambassadorship and find a replacement as soon as possible.\"\nA source familiar with the investigation said in recent weeks that prosecutors subpoenaed Sessions seeking any documents related to the letter requesting that Yovanovitch be fired.\nSessions has maintained he took no action at the behest of Parnas and Fruman, but that he wrote that letter only after several congressional colleagues reported to him claims that Yovanovitch was disparaging President Donald Trump, which Yovanovitch has denied under oath.\n\"My entire motivation for sending the letter was that I believe that political appointees should not be disparaging the president, especially while serving overseas,\" Sessions said in a statement.\nA spokesman for Sessions said the former congressman is cooperating with investigators and has turned over the requested documents.\nThe source told ABC News federal investigators also have a significant number of questions for Sessions about Giuliani.\nWhile the circumstances of Fruman's and Parnas' alleged roles in Yovanovitch's removal is not the primary focus of federal prosecutors in New York, according to sources, it does give criminal investigators a potential avenue, depending how aggressive they are, to delve into a key aspect of the Ukrainian scandal unfolding in Washington.\nUnderstanding why Fruman and Parnas allegedly wanted Yovanovitch out of Ukraine, and who backed those efforts, has potential implications for their close associate, Giuliani. The former prosecutor and New York mayor also was working to get Yovanovitch removed and is accused of being the architect of a plan involving Trump to have Ukrainian officials investigate Vice President Joe Biden.\nIt's not yet completely clear how Parnas and Fruman financed their alleged efforts to influence U.S. politics and to remove an ambassador. Both men have pleaded not guilty to alleged campaign finance violations.\nAccording to the indictment, Parnas and Fruman falsely claimed the source of their alleged illegal contributions was a limited liability corporation they established called Global Energy Producers. The government alleges the money actually came from a \"private lending transaction between Fruman and third parties, and never passed through a GEP account.\"\nYovanovitch apparently knew she was a target. She testified as part of the impeachment inquiry that a senior Ukrainian official who contacted her in February told her about \"two individuals from Florida, Mr. Parnas and Mr. Fruman, who were working with Giuliani.\"\nThat senior Ukrainian official, Yovanovitch testified to House investigators, \"was very concerned, and told me I really needed to watch my back.\""

        "text": "Former national security adviser John Bolton derided President Donald Trump's daughter and son-in-law during a private speech last week and suggested his former boss' approach to U.S. policy on Turkey is motivated by personal or financial interests, several people who were present for the remarks told NBC News.\nAccording to six people who were there, Bolton also questioned the merits of Trump applying his business acumen to foreign policy, saying such issues can't be approached like the win-or-lose edict that drives real estate deals: When one deal doesn't work, you move on to the next.\nThe description was part of a broader portrait Bolton outlined of a president who lacks an understanding of the interconnected nature of relationships in foreign policy and the need for consistency, these people said.\nBolton has kept a low public profile since he left the administration on Sept. 10, and efforts by Democrats to have him testify in the House impeachment inquiry into the president have stalled. But his pointed comments, at a private gathering last Wednesday at Morgan Stanley's global investment event in Miami, painted a dark image of a president and his family whose potential personal gain is at the heart of decision-making, according to people who were present for his remarks.\nDownload the NBC News app for breaking news and politics\nBolton served as Trump's national security adviser for 17 months. The Ukraine scandal began to unfold about a week after his contentious departure. Trump said he'd fired him, though Bolton said he had resigned.\nMultiple people who attended Bolton's private speech in Miami did not recall him mentioning Ukraine but said he told attendees that he had kept a resignation letter in his desk for three months. Bolton declined to comment for this article.\nBolton is a potential linchpin witness in the inquiry into Trump's efforts to elicit help from the Ukrainian government to investigate the family of former Vice President Joe Biden, given his central role in the White House during that time. The impeachment inquiry moves to public testimony this week.\nCurrent and former administration officials have testified about Bolton's strong opposition to the Ukraine pressure effort, which was led by Trump's personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani and allegedly involved withholding military aid and a presidential meeting until the Ukrainian government publicly committed to investigations, including into 2016 U.S. election interference and a business associated with Biden's son Hunter.\nBolton's lawyer teased his client's value last week in a letter to House Democrats that noted that the former national security adviser had been present for \"many relevant meetings and conversations\" on Ukraine, including some that have yet to be disclosed to investigators. His lawyer, Charles Cooper, said Bolton is willing to testify if a federal court approves it and issues a ruling that essentially says he can defy the White House's position that he can't speak to Congress.\nBolton, a long-time foreign policy hawk who also served in the administration of President George W. Bush, expressed support in his private remarks for Trump's stance against China on trade, people present said. But Trump and Bolton had a litany of policy differences \u2014 on Iran, North Korea, Syria and, apparently, Ukraine.\nBolton told the gathering of Morgan Stanley's largest hedge fund clients that he was most frustrated with Trump over his handling of Turkey, people who were present said. Noting the broad bipartisan support in Congress to sanction Turkey after President Recep Tayyip Erdogan purchased a Russian missile defense system, Bolton said Trump's resistance to the move was unreasonable, four people present for his speech said.\nBolton said he believes there is a personal or business relationship dictating Trump's position on Turkey because none of his advisers are aligned with him on the issue, the people present said.\nThe Trump Organization has a property in Istanbul, and the president's daughter Ivanka Trump attended the opening with Erdogan in 2012. Though it's a leasing agreement for use of the Trump name, Trump himself said in a 2015 interview that the arrangement presented \"a little conflict of interest\" should he be elected.\nDuring an Oct. 6 phone call with Erdogan, Trump agreed to pull back U.S. troops from northeast Syria so Turkish forces could launch an attack against America's Kurdish allies in the area. The presence of U.S. forces had deterred Erdogan from invading Syria, which he had threatened to do for years. Trump's decision, followed by an order for all U.S. troops to exit Syria, was widely criticized even among the president's Republican allies and was seen by many as a gift to the Turkish leader.\nErdogan is set to visit the White House on Wednesday.\nLike other former Trump advisers, Bolton said regardless of how much evidence is provided to Trump that Russia interfered in the 2016 election, the president refuses to take any action because he views any move against Moscow as giving credence to the notion that his election is invalid, the people present for Bolton's remarks said.\nAt one point in his closed-door remarks, Bolton was asked what he thinks will happen in January 2021 if Trump is re-elected, people present for his remarks said. Bolton responded by taking a swipe at Trump's son-in-law, Jared Kushner, and Ivanka Trump \u2014 both of whom are senior White House advisers \u2014 and at Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., three people familiar with his remarks said.\nBolton said Trump could go full isolationist \u2014 with the faction of the Republican Party that aligns with Paul's foreign policy views taking over the GOP \u2014 and could withdraw the U.S. from NATO and other international alliances, three people present for his remarks said.\nHe also suggested that Kushner and Ivanka Trump could convince the president to rewrite his legacy and nominate a liberal like Lawrence Tribe \u2014 a Harvard Law professor who has questioned Trump's fitness for office and was a legal adviser to Barack Obama's 2008 campaign \u2014 to the Supreme Court, the people present for Bolton's speech said.\nBolton said, with an eye roll that suggested he doesn't take them seriously, that Kushner and Ivanka Trump could do so in an attempt to prove they had real influence and were in the White House representing the people they want to be in social circles with at home in New York City, the people present for his remarks said.\nThose present said that at that point, the audience appeared shocked.\nBolton has been writing a book, having reached a deal with Simon & Schuster, and people present for his remarks in Miami said he suggested to the audience several times that if they read it, there would be much more material along the lines of what was in his speech."

Though not listed among their official duties, remaining popular is also an important part of their job.  \n\nUnlike U.S. presidents and most state governors, senators do not have term limits. As a result, they can keep their job as long as they remain popular and in good health. Throughout history, dozens of senators have served for multiple decades. Nine senators, including one sitting senator, Patrick Leahy of Vermont, have served for over 40 years. \n\n24/7 Wall St. reviewed public opinion data from research company Morning Consult to rank all 100 U.S. senators from most to least popular. Senator approval ratings are based on survey data collected during the third quarter of 2019 and range from 33% to 65%.\n\nEach state has two senators \u2014 and even though both are representing the interests of the same people, perceptions of how effective they are can vary considerably. For example, the two senators from Vermont \u2014 independent Bernie Sanders and Democrat Patrick Leahy \u2014 have the two highest approval ratings in the country, at 65% and 63%, respectively. In contrast, Angus King, an independent from Maine, is one of the most popular senators with a 57% approval rating. Meanwhile, Maine's other senator, Republican Susan Collins, is one of the least popular, with an approval rating of just 43%. \n\nOne factor that seems to be largely affecting senators' approval rating is economic conditions \u2014 even though the state of the economy is often out of the control of elected officials. Of the 20 Senators with approval ratings of at least 50%, 16 are from states where the annual unemployment rate is below the 3.9% national average. Meanwhile, only six of the 20 least popular senators are from states with lower than average unemployment. These are the states where it is hardest to find full-time work.\n\nAside from economic reasons, dissatisfaction with a senator can have any number of other causes \u2014 including a personal scandal or public gaffe. But a major scandal or loss of public approval doesn't necessarily mean a senator will lose their job. In areas where large swaths of eligible voters do not turn out on election day, controversial and even unpopular leaders can still win elections.

There's nothing there,\" Graham said in an interview Saturday with KCCI, a Des Moines CBS affiliate. \n{mosads}\"I'm trying to let the House know, \u2018You're dividing America for no good reason.' We got a lot of things we should be doing, like lowering drug costs and getting a trade deal with Canada and Mexico,\" he added.\nGraham has been one of Trump's staunchest allies defending the president's actions amid the impeachment inquiry. \nHe told CBS News last week he won't read the transcripts released of witness depositions. \n\"I've written the whole process off,\" he said. \nWitnesses have testified that Trump directed Ukrainian leaders to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden, a leading 2020 presidential candidate, and have indicated that the Trump administration withheld aid in return for Ukraine's announcing an investigation into Biden. \nThe White House released a memo of the July 25 call at the center of the inquiry, which Graham referred to in his interview, that shows Trump asking Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky for \"a favor\" and later asking him to \"look into\" Biden. \nTrump has said the call was \"perfect\" and most Republicans have stood by him in his defense. \nHouse Democrats are starting public hearings as part of the impeachment inquiry next week, kicking off with two key witness testimonies on Wednesday and one on Friday.

        "text": "Hampton \u2014 Mary T. Christian, a champion of education, a groundbreaking Hampton community leader, a longtime delegate and a college professor, died Monday night at age 95.\n\"She slipped away. That's the way she wanted to go, peacefully,\" said Benita Toler, her daughter. \"God granted that request.\"\nToler said she had spoken to her mother Sunday evening and learned early Monday she had taken a turn. Toler drove from Fairfax to her mother's room at the Sentara Careplex Hospital in Hampton. She said her mother had battled illnesses in recent years, but always bounced back.\n\"She took her last breath after I told her I loved her and everyone (there) said they loved her. It was so sudden,\" she said.\nChristian was with her daughter and others she considered as children.\n\"She was a phenomenal mother and I can truly say I have admired her all my life. Mom just loved everyone,\" Toler said. \"She taught us how to love. She was the most selfless person and you could call her the problem solver.\"\nToler said her mother was famous for taking people in, or going up to strangers, asking if they needed help.\n\"She went to up anybody who was in distress \u2026 asking \u2018Are you OK?' My mom was going to help you. If you were homeless, my mother would bring (you) home,\" she said.\nRecently Toler, also a Hampton University alum, with a Ph.D. from Virginia Tech, said she organized a joint birthday party in September for her mother and father, Wilbur Christian, both of whom turned 95 this year.\n\"He is having a hard time,\" Toler said. \"They have known each other since grade school. They had been together since forever. We didn't expect it to just happen. My Mom and Dad (have) a beautiful love story.\"\nShe was \"Dr. C\" to her students and to those who knew her well. She worked as an elementary school teacher and dean of education at Hampton University before her election to the General Assembly in 1986. She retired in 2004.\nAs news of her death spread, politicians from Hampton Roads and around the state poured out praise.\n\"Dr. C leaves a deep legacy of leadership and advocacy in her community and in the state, and she will be missed,\" said Gov. Ralph Northam in a statement Tuesday. \"My heartfelt sympathies go out to her family and friends.\"\nShe was the first black woman to serve on the Hampton School Board, elected in 1973. She also was the first African American and the first woman to represent her district in the House of Delegates since Reconstruction.\n\"She was a woman of great vision and integrity,\" Hampton City Councilman Steve Brown said. \"... Her legacy will be lasting. There is not much in the city of Hampton that \u2018Doc' had not initiated.\"\nJoni Ivey, former chief of staff for Congressman Bobby Scott, D-Newport News, said she met Christian over 40 years ago, when they both were young professionals working on the Peninsula. As a long-standing representative, she was a mentor and friend to a number of elected Peninsula officials.\n\"You couldn't run for office in Hampton unless you stopped by to see Dr. C,\" Ivey said. \"I mean, that was just known.\"\n\"There was no greater champion for education than Delegate Mary Christian,\" U.S. Sen. Tim Kaine said. \"While we are so saddened by her passing, we can all celebrate the amazing life Dr. C lived and her tireless advocacy on behalf of her constituents and students. My thoughts are with her family and the Hampton community.\"\nLikewise, Sen. Mark Warner honored her memory via social media.\n\"From her time as an educator to her work in the House of Delegates, Dr. Mary T. Christian dedicated her career to serving her community and making our Commonwealth a better place,\" Warner posted on Twitter. \"She was a good friend and an even better champion for Virginians.\"\nJames Eason, who served 16 years as Hampton's mayor, echoed those sentiments when he learned of her death.\n\"I don't think there are many people in Hampton who don't have the deepest respect for Mary Christian,\" Eason said. \"That came from just the way she acted and the way she related to other people. She took the time to talk to you and to really listen to what you have to say. \"\nGaylene Kanoyton, Hampton Branch NAACP, said she was with the former delegate following the historic elections in Virginia, when the Democrats took back control of the General Assembly.\nKanoyton said Christian was in good spirits, had her hair styled and wore lipstick. She was also with her Monday before she died.\n\"We were so blessed to have her for five years longer. She did so much good while she was here on earth,\" Kanoyton said. \"She taught me the importance of being consistent, steadfast and humble. She helped everybody. Her main legacy is caring for her community and making sure it was fair and equal. It's our job to live her legacy.\"\n\"Her service, her dedication and support can never accurately be measured,\" said Del. Jeion Ward, who represents the 92nd District, in a statement through the Virginia Legislative Black Caucus. \"She was my predecessor, my Soror, and my friend. Dr. Mary T. Christian was the epitome of a phenomenal woman.\"\nHer advocacy for education causes and school funding were a common thread. She was one of the first handful of African American appointees to the House Appropriations Committee.\n\"As an educator, the first black woman to serve on the Hampton School Board, and a longtime member of the House of Delegates, Dr. C was a pillar of the Hampton community,\" said Rep. Bobby Scott, D-Newport News, in a statement Tuesday. \"She dedicated her life and career in service to others and was a powerful voice for the voiceless.\"\nAnn Stephens Cherry, chair of the Hampton School Board, issued a statement: \"She will be remembered for a legacy that consisted of values, integrity and equality. Her passing most certainly leaves a void not only in our community, but in the public education arena as well.\"\nShe earned a bachelor's degree in elementary education from then-Hampton Institute in 1955. She later received a master's degree from Columbia University in 1960 and a Ph.D. in education from Michigan State University in 1967, according to her bio on the Barrett-Peake Foundation website.\nShe was a professor at Hampton University for over 25 years and retired as dean of the school of education in 1989, taking on the title of professor emeritus.\n\"Dr. Christian has always been an outstanding lady, colleague, academician, administrator, leader, alumna, legislator and friend. She was loyal and supportive of Hampton University, her alma mater, up until the very end,\" said Hampton University President, Dr. William R. Harvey in a statement. \"I will personally miss this kind-hearted, effective and productive lady.\"\nShe also had a strong relationship with Thomas Nelson Community College, where the performing arts auditorium is named in her honor.\n\"She was the epitome of a renaissance woman: educator, legislator, leader. She was the first, a change agent, a voice of reason, one who made a difference in our community,\" said State Sen. Mamie Locke.\nHampton Commonwealth's Attorney Anton Bell called Christian a mentor and friend.\n\"She had a servant's heart,\" Bell said, saying that she often spoke to him about the importance of modeling good character and \"remaining above approach\" while giving back to the community.\n\"She was proud to be an African American woman, and she wanted to make sure that as an African American male that I made our people proud,\" Bell said. \"She understood that as black elected officials and black public officials, that you're a role model. ... She taught me that I should be a positive role model for African American young people, and to always conduct myself in a way that they could emulate me.\"\nIvey attended Christian's 95th birthday party in September. A number of her former students showed up to talk about the impact she had on their life.\n\"Many of them are all around the country, doing great things, and it's because she poured into their life,\" Ivey said.\nChristian hadn't slowed down after retiring from the General Assembly. Along with Colita Fairfax, a professor of social work at Norfolk State University, she founded the Barrett-Peake Heritage Foundation, which aims to preserve sites of African American heritage, upgrade and secure signage for historic cemeteries, and develop new educational and cultural programs.\n\"My mentor ... understood that in order to develop community, you have to be in the community,\" Fairfax wrote in an email. She said she considers it her mission to carry on Christian's vision to preserve African American culture, traditions and historically black cemeteries via the foundation. \"You have to have institutions that are going to attend to the infrastructure of the community and to the development of people.\"\nIn May, Christian helped organize a cleanup of a historic African American cemetery in downtown Hampton.\n\"She never sat down,\" Ivey said. \"She kept going until she took her last breath.\"\nShe is survived by her second husband, Wilbur Bernard Christian; a sister, Madeline Lee, and husband Robert Lee; two daughters, Benita Toler and husband Garvis Toler, and Carolyn Taylor; and a host of nieces and nephews, grandchildren and great-grandchildren.\nA wake is scheduled for 5-7 p.m. Sunday at the First Baptist Church of Hampton, 229 N King St. The funeral is tentatively scheduled to take place at Hampton University Convocation Center Nov. 18.\nIn lieu of flowers, the family requests contributions be made to the Barrett-Peake Heritage Foundation at barrett-peake.org."

        "text": "Hundreds of immigrants, students and immigrant- rights activists rallied in downtown Los Angeles in support of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program Tuesday, hours after the U.S. Supreme Court heard arguments over the Trump Administration's efforts to end the program.\nSome students walked out of classes and traveled downtown to take part in the rally and march to show their backing for DACA, which provides deportation protection for immigrants who were brought into the country illegally by their parents.\nThe Trump Administration has argued that President Barack Obama exceeded his constitutional powers by bypassing Congress when he created DACA by executive action. President Donald Trump has made his hard-line immigration policies, including pursuing construction of a wall along the U.S.-Mexican border, a centerpiece of his presidency and his re-election campaign for 2020.\nDACA protects roughly 660,000 immigrants, mostly Hispanic young adults, from deportation and provides them work permits, though not a path to citizenship.\nOne DACA recipient rallying outside the federal building in downtown Los Angeles told NBC4 that ending the program will throw the futures of thousands of people into question.\n\"What happens to me happens to every DACA recipient,\" she said. \"The government has our information. We've been turning it in every two years. DACA, yes, is a work permit, but at it's core it's protection against deportation. If you take DACA, not only am I eligible for deportation, but the government has my information. So that's something that we have to ring the alarm with our Congress and senators to find some permanent solution so we don't have to keep having this fight every two years.\"\nCalifornia Attorney General Xavier Becerra was among the attorneys arguing on behalf of DACA before the U.S. Supreme Court Tuesday.\n\"We take our historic fight to the Supreme Court to defend the DACA program,\" Becerra said. \"This fight is about protecting the doctors, the teachers, the innovators in the tech community. All those people who are out there doing great things for America and happen to be Dreamers.\"\n\"President Trump's reckless, heartless decision to end DACA runs counter to the values that we hold most dear that everyone who works had and plays by the rules deserves a chance to get ahead,\" Becerra wrote on Twitter.\nIn contrast, Trump on Tuesday described many of the immigrants dubbed \"Dreamers\" as \"hardened criminals,\" but said that if the Supreme Court backs his decision to end DACA, he will cut a deal with Democrats regarding the future of Dreamers, as DACA beneficiaries are known.\n\"Many of the people in DACA, no longer very young, are far from angels. Some are very tough, hardened criminals,\" Trump wrote on Twitter.\nThe Supreme Court case centers on the legality of Trump's 2017 plan to rescind DACA. A decision is expected by June 2020, amid the presidential election campaign. The high court case is not over whether DACA itself is legal, but the steps taken by the administration to end it. For the tens of thousands of people affected by DACA, the difference is largely academic.\nThe Supreme Court case stems from lower court rulings in New York, California and the District of Columbia that blocked the president's move and left DACA in place.\nThe lower courts ruled that Trump violated a U.S. law called the Administrative Procedure Act, which requires policy changes be done in an orderly way, in seeking to rescind DACA.\nIn his 2017 statement on phasing out DACA, Trump alleged there are \"tragic consequences\" to the United States of a decades-long failure by leaders in Washington to enforce immigration laws, citing \"the illicit entry of dangerous drugs and criminal cartels.\"\nThe program, which allows eligible immigrants to be issued renewable two-year work permits, remains in effect for those already enrolled, but the administration has refused to approve new applications.\nLos Angeles County Supervisor Hilda L. Solis, a former Obama cabinet member, held a news conference in Los Angeles Tuesday morning to showcase support for DACA beneficiaries. She was joined by DACA beneficiaries, Rigoberto Reyes, executive director for the county office of Immigrant Affairs, L.A. Community College District Chancellor Francisco Rodriguez, and members of civic groups.\n\"The County of Los Angeles opposes this administration's misguided attempt to dismantle DACA. We will not stop fighting. I join in solidarity with educators, employers, medical professionals, students and community leaders in expressing our support of DACA,\" sais Solis, who has authored and passed 45 motions at the Board of Supervisors to protect, defend, and fight for the rights of immigrants since the 2016 presidential election.\n\"This is unlike any other Supreme Court case. The Supreme Court's eventual ruling on DACA will extend to our idea of humanity, and who we are as a country, and who we aspire to be. As the proud daughter of immigrants, I know this country was built on the tremendous sacrifices of hard-working immigrants.\"\nWithout mentioning Trump, she expressed views sharply at odds with his stance that the Dreamers \"are far from angels\" and include \"hardened criminals.\"\n\"Dreamers embody the values of this country through their work ethic, their optimism, and unwavering loyalty to this nation. DACA recipients are military veterans, medical students, and employees of Fortune 500 companies. Dreamers are our friends, family members, employers, and neighbors. DACA recipients were brought to this country as children, and they grew up in the United States. This country is their home.\""

But this time, according to police records, Kevin also \"crashed his motor vehicle into her hitting her in the legs causing pain and serious bodily injury.\"\nErica said she thought she was going to be killed.\n\"I didn't think it was going to be over until he killed me,\" she said.\nArlington Police arrested Kevin for aggravated assault with a deadly weapon.\nErica said he was hoping that night would be the last time she would have to see her estranged husband.\nBut while awaiting his trial, Kevin was released on bond. The conditions of his bond included \"do not contact the victim, Erica Wilson, in any manner.\"\nHowever, one day Kevin showed up at Erica's house in Fort Worth.\nErica called police expecting officers to arrest him for violating his bond, but when officers arrived, they did not arrest Kevin.\nOfficers had no way of accessing Kevin's conditions of bond on their patrol vehicle's computers, so there was little they could do.\nWhen officers left, Erica said, Kevin tried to burn the house down.\n\"If they would have known and it was in the system and they could see it, they would have taken him and removed him from the premise and it would have turned out a whole other way,\" Erica said.\nIn September, Kevin pleaded guilty to aggravated assault and was sentenced to two years in prison.\nTexas lawmakers had a chance to ensure others would not be left in similar dangerous situations but failed.\nEarlier this year, state lawmakers introduced Senate Bill 1804 that would require conditions of bond to be entered into a statewide database. That way every Texas police officer could look up conditions of bond on their computer.\n\"As a survivor of domestic violence I can say this bill will save lives,\" Erica said at a hearing in Austin on the bill.\nLawmakers overwhelmingly passed the bill but Governor Greg Abbott vetoed it.\nAbbott said he supported the bill \"until someone slipped in an ill-considered giveaway to a radioactive waste disposal facility.\"\nJust before the bill was given final approval, State Rep. Alfonso \"Poncho\" Nev\u00e1rez, D-Eagle Pass, added an amendment that would allow a low-level radioactive waste facility in West Texas to delay paying millions of dollars in fees to the state.\n\"They say it (adding the amendment) was ill-advised. No, what was ill-advised was the Governor vetoing the bill,\" Rep. Nev\u00e1rez said.\nThe Eagle Pass lawmaker acknowledged his amendment had nothing to do with the topic of the domestic violence bill and is sorry the bill was vetoed, but he told the CBS 11 News I-Team he does not regret adding the amendment.\n\"I didn't do anything wrong,\" he explained. \"I did what the rules allowed me to do. The Governor should have signed the bill. The bigger question is asking the governor what compelled you to veto a bill when there was something so important on it.\"\nRep. Nev\u00e1rez said he was surprised Gov. Abbott vetoed it because two years prior Abbott did not block a bill that allowed a similar tax incentive for the same radioactive waste facility in Andrews County.\nAbbott's office said the Governor had to veto the bill because the tax incentive amendment was not germane to the original bill.\nLast month, the Governor's Office sent a letter to Department of Public Safety requesting the department work to figure out a way its current statewide crime information system can include conditions of bond until lawmakers can try and pass the bill again when they next meet in 2021."

The conversation, which lasted more than an hour, touched on details including dates for recording and releasing the podcast, settling on a logo, and the process of uploading the podcast to iTunes and other podcast distributors.\nTwo people who overheard Giuliani's discussion reached out to CNN and provided a recording they decided to make of the conversation. They contacted CNN unprompted after reading a recent story about Giuliani and the President's ongoing relationship. The people asked not to be identified and provided the audio recording on the condition that it not be published.\n\"Many Americans want to hear directly from Rudy Giuliani,\" said Christiann\u00e9 Allen, a spokeswoman for Giuliani, who confirmed to CNN that he discussed the podcast idea at lunch on Saturday. \"He is considering several options, in consultation with Jay Sekulow and the legal team, regarding the best way to move forward. As of now, they have not decided on the strategy but are getting very close.\"\nIn the conversation, Giuliani said he hoped to have four or five episodes \"to analyze the impeachment in every aspect.\" Giuliani's intention seems to be to have four episodes finished before the start of the Senate trial.\nGiuliani also mentioned two op-eds for major newspapers he was planning on publishing, the first of which would explain why Trump is \"unimpeachable\" and the second offering an explanation of Giuliani's defense of his client, the President.\nDespite his central role in the events surrounding the impeachment inquiry, Giuliani has remained relatively silent since the October arrest and indictment of two of his associates, Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman. He briefly re-emerged on Friday in an appearance on a separate impeachment-focused podcast hosted by former Trump White House official Steve Bannon. In that interview, Giuliani offered his own political analysis of impeachment, saying that some Democrats who vote for articles of impeachment in the House could lose their seats in 2020.\nClosed-door testimony from multiple witnesses describes Giuliani as a key facilitator of conversations and actions that have led to the impeachment probe. This week, public testimony from several of those witnesses, including former Ukraine ambassador Marie Yovanovitch, senior State Department official George Kent and Bill Taylor, the top diplomat in Ukraine following Yovanovitch's removal, is expected to further highlight Giuliani's central role. Giuliani has said his actions were all done as part of his legal defense of Trump.\nDuring his conversation on Saturday, Giuliani talked about using the podcast as a way to tell his side of the story and counter-balance the first public televised testimony of the House's impeachment inquiry.\nA person close to Trump's legal team suggested the podcast would be a smart counter-move as the hearings will dominate news coverage.\nBut the podcast could also be risky to the former New York mayor. Federal prosecutors in New York are scrutinizing Giuliani's business dealings with Parnas and Fruman. Both men have emerged as key players in Giuliani's efforts to get the Ukrainian government to investigate Trump's political opponents, including former Vice President Joe Biden and his son Hunter. There is no evidence of wrongdoing by either Biden.\nGiuliani has served Trump's legal team primarily by defending the President in media appearances and interviews, first focused on the special counsel investigation into Russian interference and now on the impeachment inquiry."

The funds \u2014 one for police and one for firefighters \u2013 would be combined for investment purposes but remain in separate accounts within the larger funds.\nPritzker rolled out the plan last month and called on lawmakers to pass it before they adjourned for the year. The governor pitched it as a way to help the pension funds, which collectively have $11.5 billion in unfunded liabilities, and to alleviate the property tax burden on homeowners.\n\"Bipartisanship in this General Assembly has achieved what none of their peers from previous General Assemblies has been able to do: consolidate the jungle of police and fire pension funds that serve first responders in the suburbs and downstate,\" Pritzker said in a news conference following the Senate vote.\nThe Senate's 42-12 vote in favor of consolidation followed the House's 96-14 vote on Wednesday.\nMany previous attempts to consolidate pensions have failed to gain traction in the General Assembly as police and fire unions and other interests have pushed to retain local control.\nAssets and liabilities would not be shifted from one municipality's fund to another, but the consolidation move is aimed at increasing investment returns to narrow a funding gap for the funds. The annual investment returns pulled in by the suburban and downstate police and fire funds have, on average, been roughly 2 percentage points lower than the Illinois Municipal Retirement Fund returns, the best-funded public pension fund in the state.\nSign up for The Spin to get the top stories in politics delivered to your inbox weekday afternoons.\nThe legislation is slightly different from what Pritzker originally proposed, in that active and retired firefighters would have majority representation on the board overseeing the funds. That move was part of a compromise reached late last week that brought on board the Illinois Fraternal Order of Police, which previously had opposed the legislation.\nThe bill that passed both chambers of the General Assembly this week also included wording that was agreeable to the Illinois Municipal League. The organization, which represents municipalities around the state, has long advocated for pension consolidation, but had withdrawn its support earlier this week. Illinois Municipal League Executive Director Brad Cole said proposed language would have shut out municipal governments from intervening in benefit allocation proceedings at the local level, which could weigh on municipal budgets and taxpayers.\n\"While the latest compromise isn't perfect, this is an important first step that will benefit employees, retirees and taxpayers across the state,\" Cole said in a statement Thursday.\nA bipartisan task force on pensions that Pritzker convened earlier this year issued a report last month that concluded that the public safety pension fund consolidation plan could mean additional investment returns of between $820 million and $2.5 billion over the next five years. In addition to being able to pool their funds for investment purposes, the move allows the hundreds of funds to cut back on administrative costs.\nIn pushing for lawmakers to approve the consolidation measure, Pritzker's administration has maintained the pension funds lose out on $1 million a day in potential investment returns.\nSen. Dale Righter, a Republican from Mattoon, questioned the validity of the savings figure and said the plan is in line with what he called a \"classic Springfield solution\" that has historically led to the underfunding of pension funds across the state.\nRighter said local control continued to be a sticking point among police and fire pensioners who contacted him about the proposal to convey: \"Are you kidding me? You want me to trust Springfield with my money? At least when we're local I can pick up the phone and ask a question.\"\nThe measure reinstates surviving spouse benefits for those police officers and firefighters hired after Jan. 1, 2011, and also increases the pensionable salary cap and changes those employees' final average salary calculation. Pritzker said those costs will be far outweighed by administrative cost savings and increased investment returns.\n\"We're finally doing what Illinois is supposed to do, which is get ahead of these issues before it becomes a crisis,\" said Sen. Linda Holmes, an Aurora Democrat.\nTogether, the existing police and fire pension funds have enough assets to cover only 55% of liabilities, which is far short of the state-mandated target of 90% funding by 2040. That has dropped since it was nearly 63% before the Great Recession, according to a report earlier this year from the legislature's bipartisan Commission on Government Forecasting and Accountability.\nThe measure addresses a piece of the pension issue in Illinois, but does not touch the billions of dollars in unfunded liabilities across Chicago pension funds and statewide pension funds that cover teachers and state government and university workers.\nThe pension task force is not disbanding, Pritzker said, and will be looking at ways to address the issues with the statewide and city of Chicago pension systems."

Elijah Cummings.\nRockeymoore Cummings, 48, resigned Monday night as the chair of the Maryland Democratic Party, a spokesperson confirmed to 11 News Monday night. She made her announcement Tuesday morning regarding the 7th Congressional District seat.\n\"I am here today proudly announcing my candidacy for the U.S. Congress,\" Rockeymoore Cummings said Tuesday morning, standing on the staircase of her Bolton Hill rowhome.\nShe told supporters she's running for her late husband's seat in the U.S. House. Cummings died Oct. 17 and was laid to rest Oct. 25. Gov. Larry Hogan issued a proclamation ordering a special election to fill the seat.\nRockeymoore Cummings said her husband wanted her to run for the seat.\n\"I want to carry that legacy forward and build upon that legacy,\" Rockeymoore Cummings said. \"I want to be your voice in the 7th Congressional District.

        "text": " The Justice Department's watchdog is nearing the release of its report on the early stages of the FBI's Russia investigation, a document likely to revive debate about a politically charged probe that shadowed President Donald Trump's administration from the outset.\nThe inspector general in recent days has invited witnesses and their lawyers who were interviewed for the report to review portions of a draft this week and next, a critical final step toward making the document public, according to multiple people familiar with the process who insisted on anonymity to discuss it.\nAs part of that process, the people will have opportunities to raise concerns or suggest potential edits, making it unclear precisely when in the coming weeks a final version could be ready for release. Inspector General Michael Horowitz told Congress in a letter last month that he did not expect a lengthy review period and that he intended to make as much of the report public as possible, with minimal redactions.\n\"A number of people who were mentioned in the report are having an opportunity right now to comment on how they're quoted in the report,\" Attorney General William Barr said at a news conference in Memphis, Tennessee. \"And after that process is over, which should be very short, the report will be issued.\"\nThe release of the report is likely to coincide with House impeachment proceedings scrutinizing the Trump administration's efforts to press Ukraine into investigating Democratic rival Joe Biden. Any finding of problems by the inspector general in how the FBI gathered and collected evidence in investigating ties between the Trump campaign and Russia could at least temporarily buoy Trump and other Republican supporters eager to turn the page from the congressional scrutiny now imperiling his White House.\nTrump has long insisted that the investigation into his campaign was a \"hoax\" and \"witch hunt,\" asserting without evidence or elaboration as recently as last month that law enforcement officials had done \"really bad things.\"\nThe attorney general defended the inspector general as a stellar and independent investigator.\n\"Inspector General Horowitz is a fiercely independent investigator, a superb investigator who I think has conducted this particular investigation in the most professional way, and I think his work, when it does come out, will be a credit to the department,\" Barr said.\nA key question examined by the inspector general has been the FBI's process for applying for, and receiving, a secret warrant to monitor the communications of former Trump campaign adviser Carter Page. The warrant was renewed multiple times by judges, but Republican critics of the Russia probe have decried the fact that the FBI relied in part in its application on uncorroborated information obtained by Christopher Steele, a former British spy who had been paid by Hillary Clinton's campaign to conduct opposition research.\nThe government did disclose to the court the political loyalties of the people who hired Steele, according to Democrats on the House intelligence committee who released their own memo last year aimed at countering Republican allegations of law enforcement misconduct.\nThe FBI opened its investigation in July 2016 after receiving information that a Trump campaign aide, George Papadopoulos, had disclosed to an Australian diplomat that Russia had thousands of stolen emails that would be potentially damaging to Clinton, an election opponent. U.S. officials have said the emails were hacked by Russian intelligence operatives and given to WikiLeaks, which released them ahead of the election.\nPapadopoulos, who served as a foreign policy adviser to Trump's campaign, had learned from a Maltese professor, Joseph Mifsud, that Russia had \"dirt\" on Clinton in the form of the stolen emails. Papadopoulos later pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI about his conversations with Mifsud.\nA spokeswoman for Horowitz declined to comment on Tuesday. Horowitz himself refused to answer questions about the report and its timing at an unrelated news conference last week. The inspector general provided a draft copy to Attorney General William Barr in September, and the Justice Department has since been conducting a classification review.\nHorowitz's team has reviewed over one million records and conducted more than 100 interviews, including several who were interviewed in the last few months, the inspector general has told Congress.\nThe investigation is one of several inquiries into the origins of the FBI's investigation into ties between the Trump campaign and Russia. The investigation was ultimately taken over by special counsel Robert Mueller, who identified multiple points of contact between Russia and Trump campaign associates but found insufficient evidence of a criminal conspiracy to tip the 2016 election in Trump's favor.\nMueller ultimately charged a half dozen Trump aides and 25 Russians accused either in the hacking of Democratic emails or in a covert social media campaign aimed at spreading disinformation.\nBarr, meanwhile, has appointed U.S. Attorney John Durham to conduct a separate investigation that has since turned into a criminal matter, according to a person familiar with the situation. It's unclear what potential crime is being looked at.\nThe Justice Department has said Trump recently made several calls at Barr's request to foreign leaders, including Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison, to help the attorney general with the current Durham probe of the investigation.\nBarr also traveled with Durham to Italy in August and September, and the two met with Italian intelligence officials to seek information about the activities of FBI agents assigned there, Italian Premier Giuseppe Conte has said. Mifsud and Papadopoulos first met in Italy in 2016.\nHorowitz himself has undertaken multiple investigations of FBI activities in the last few years. Last year, he released a report criticizing former FBI Director James Comey for his handling of the investigation into Clinton's use of a private email server, though he also concluded that none of his decisions were tainted by political bias.\nHe has more recently criticized Comey for his handling of memos documenting private interactions with Trump, though the Justice Department declined to prosecute."

        "text": "President Joe Biden participated Thursday in a CNN town hall in Baltimore, taking questions from anchor Anderson Cooper and local residents about his legislative agenda and a variety of other topics.\nBiden made some false claims, along with making other claims that could have used additional context.\nHere's a fact check of some of his claims from Thursday's town hall.\nBiden and the border\nA college student asked Biden: \"Given that it's nearly been a year into your campaign, why haven't you been to the southern border of our country?\"\nAfter Biden addressed another immigration question from the student but ignored that one, Cooper followed up. Biden then responded, \"I've been there before, and I haven't \u2013 I mean, I know it well. I guess I should go down. But the \u2013 but the whole point of it is: I haven't had a whole hell of lot of time to get down.\"\nBiden explained that he has been spending time inspecting hurricane damage and \"traveling around the world,\" then added, \"But I plan on \u2013 now, my wife, Jill, has been down. She's been on both sides of the river. She's seen the circumstances there.\"\nFacts First: Biden's claims need context. Jill Biden's last visit to the border was in December 2019, during the presidential campaign, not as first lady. Also, the only evidence the White House has cited for Joe Biden's claim that he has himself \"been there before\" was a Friday statement that Biden's motorcade briefly drove near the border during a campaign trip in 2008 \u2013 when he was on his way from an airport in the border city of El Paso, Texas, to a rally in a New Mexico town that is located just under an hour from the border. CNN couldn't immediately find evidence of a specific Biden visit to, say, a border facility or to US personnel stationed at the border.\nWhite House press secretary Jen Psaki said at her Friday briefing that \"he did drive through the border when he was on the campaign trail in 2008.\" It's not clear what Psaki meant by \"through.\" Regardless, if this drive was what Biden was talking about when he said he had \"been there before,\" he certainly could have been clearer about the fact that he was referring to a passing moment in a car rather than some sort of deliberate migration-related stop. (The Washington Post reported Friday that this 2008 drive took Biden on a route \"that for a few minutes hugs the border.\")\nPsaki said Friday that the President \"does not believe a photo op is the same as solutions.\" She said that former President Donald Trump had visited the border but had not delivered positive results on immigration.\nThe \"most important thing,\" Psaki said, is that Biden \"has worked on these issues throughout his entire career, and is well-versed in every aspect of our immigration system, including the border. That includes when he was Vice President, and he went to Mexico and Central America 10 times to address border issues and talk about what we can do to reduce the number of migrants who were coming to the border.\"\nThough Biden mentioned foreign travel as one of the reasons he has not gone to the border as President to date, he has made only one trip abroad during the first nine months of his pandemic-era term \u2013 a June trip to Europe. He is scheduled for another Europe trip next weekend for a G20 summit and United Nations climate conference.\nTax rates\nAfter he was asked a question about taxes on the wealthy, Biden said that under \"this present tax code, the highest tax rate is 35 percent.\"\nFacts First: Biden was wrong. The top marginal rate is actually 37%; 35% is the second-highest marginal rate. The 37 percent rate affects individual single taxpayers with taxable incomes greater than $523,600 and married couples filing jointly with taxable incomes greater than $628,300. The 35 percent rate affects individuals with taxable incomes greater than $209,425 and married joint filers at incomes greater than $418,850.\nVaccinations\nBiden said, \"When I first was elected, there were only 2 million people who had Covid shots in the United States of America \u2013 had the vaccine. Now we got 190 million, because I went out and bought everything I could do and buy in sight, and it worked.\"\nFacts First: Biden's \"2 million people\" assertion was inaccurate no matter which way you parse it \u2013 slightly off if you decide to be charitable, way off if not. Also, Biden gave too much credit to his own administration's vaccine purchases. The Trump administration purchased enough vaccine doses to fully vaccinate at least a large percentage of the 190 million people who have received two shots at present.\nLet's look first at the issue of credit. According to the Government Accountability Office, a nonpartisan watchdog for Congress, \"As of December 31, 2020, the government had at least 800 million vaccine doses under contract expected to be delivered by July 31, 2021, pending any issues with clinical trials, (emergency use authorization) issuance, or other factors.\" That included 200 million doses each of the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines that would prove by far the most popular with Americans. Also, the Trump-era contracts with Pfizer and Moderna gave the US the option to buy hundreds of millions more doses.\nEven with millions of doses being wasted after delivery, the contracts signed during the Trump presidency covered, at minimum, a large majority of the people who have been vaccinated so far.\nBiden is free to boast that his administration's own actions have resulted in more people getting vaccinated than would have under a Trump administration whose pandemic response was widely criticized. Asked about Biden's claim, a White House official noted Friday that the Biden administration bought additional doses in January and again in the summer, and that the administration used the Defense Production Act to allow Pfizer to accelerate its vaccine manufacturing by getting easier access to critical supplies it had struggled to obtain.\nAll of that is fair enough. But Biden was still hyperbolic here in giving sole credit to his own purchases.\nLet's now turn to Biden's claim that \"only 2 million people\" had Covid shots when he was first elected.\nObviously, only the tiny number of Americans who participated in clinical trials had received Covid-19 shots when Biden was elected in November, since public vaccinations began in December. But even if we look at the situation when Biden first took office on January 20, his claim that \"there were only 2 million people who had Covid shots\" is at least a bit incorrect.\nAccording to data from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, more than 18 million people in the US had received at least one shot at the time. But Biden did say \"shots,\" plural, and he was comparing this figure to the 190 million current figure for fully vaccinated Americans, so he was likely referring, imprecisely, to the number of people who were fully vaccinated early in his presidency.\nEven then, though, current CDC data says 3.4 million people were fully vaccinated on January 20. Biden might have been thinking of news reports from January 20, based on CDC data available at the time, that put the number at around 2 million, but the CDC numbers get updated over time as more information comes in and vaccinations are assigned to the date they actually occurred instead of the date they were reported.\nVaccination sites\nBiden said that \"there are over 800,000 sites right now that exist in America where you can go get a vaccine.\"\nFacts First: This is false; Biden added an extra zero. The White House official said Biden meant 80,000 vaccination sites, the number he has used on multiple previous occasions.\nFox and vaccinations\nTalking about right-wing television station Fox News, Biden asked, \"Do you realize they mandate vaccinations?\"\nFacts First: This needs context. Fox Corp., which owns Fox News, has a Covid-19 vaccination policy stricter than the one Biden plans to impose on many US companies \u2013 and Fox News hosts, like CNN journalists and others, have described Biden's policy as a \"mandate.\" However, it's important to note that Fox Corp. does not actually require that employees get vaccinated. Rather, in a September memo, Fox Corp. announced that it would require unvaccinated employees to get tested daily.\nIn other words, the Fox policy is most thoroughly described as a vaccination-or-test mandate. However, we can't be too hard on Biden for describing it as a vaccination mandate given that his own planned vaccination-or-test mandate \u2013 which he says will require companies with 100 or more employees to ensure their workers are either vaccinated or get tested at least weekly \u2013 is also commonly described, on Fox and elsewhere, as a vaccination mandate.\nBiden's jobs record\nBiden said, \"We've created more jobs in the first eight months of my administration than any president in American history.\"\nFacts First: This is true, but the circumstances of Biden's first eight months are so different from the circumstances that greeted every other newly elected modern president that meaningful direct comparison is effectively impossible. Biden took office less than a year after the economy shed more than 22 million jobs in two months because of the pandemic. Even with the jobs rebound that began in May 2020, the US still has about 5 million fewer jobs than it did before the pandemic hit. In other words, Biden-era gains \u2013 an average of more than 600,000 jobs added per month from February through September \u2013 are still filling the giant pandemic hole.\nBiden is free, of course, to argue that he is doing a good job filling that hole. But his president-versus-president boasts should be viewed with contextual caution.\nThis is a breaking story and will be updated."

Jurors on Thursday concluded about 6 hours of deliberations without reaching a verdict.\nStone, a longtime confidant of President Donald Trump, was indicted in January as part of special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into Russian election tampering.\nHe is accused of lying to Congress about his attempts to communicate with the anti-secrecy website WikiLeaks, tampering with witnesses and obstructing a House Intelligence Committee investigation into whether the Trump campaign coordinated with Russia to tip the 2016 election.\nSeveral witnesses have highlighted how Trump campaign associates were eager to gather information about emails the U.S. says were hacked by Russia and then provided to WikiLeaks. Stone was regarded as an \"access point\" to WikiLeaks due to his frequent boasts of having insider access to WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange.\nDefense attorneys have countered that Stone and the campaign's curiosity about the WikiLeaks emails was natural and legal. They claim Stone never intentionally deceived Congress and that he was simply wrong in his testimony after committee members unexpectedly peppered him with WikiLeaks-related questions.\nJurors asked two different technical questions about one of the seven charges Stone faces, prompting lawyers and Judge Amy Berman Jackson to debate how to respond. At one point, jurors were called back into the courtroom to receive further instructions and Jackson noted that some of them seemed frustrated at the lack of clear guidance from the court.\nStone could face up to 20 years in prison if convicted."

        "text": "State Sen. Darryl Rouson, a Democrat from St. Petersburg, filed a bill which would set a framework for judges to re-sentence inmates who are serving outdated sentences no longer in state law.\nThe problem was highlighted in a Times/Herald investigation published Wednesday. The story showed how Florida's continued changes to its drug sentencing laws have not been applied to anyone already behind bars serving outdated sentences. Until recently, an obscure clause in Florida's constitution dating back to the Jim Crow era had prohibited state lawmakers from retroactively applying sentencing changes to old cases.\nBut since voters repealed that clause in 2018 by passing Amendment 11, the state Legislature has yet to put it into action. Rouson sponsored that ballot amendment.\nRELATED: Hundreds of Florida inmates are serving drug sentences no longer in state law\nHe had said previously that he was considering filing a bill to help inmates in this legal time warp get new sentences consistent with current law. But hours after the Times/Herald investigation published, his bill appeared on the state's website.\nRouson's office said the story prompted them to move quickly to make the bill a reality.\n\"At the end of the day, it's about saving lives,\" Rouson said. \"Keeping families intact and returning citizens back to the community.\"\nUnlike a related House bill which would only allow inmates to be re-sentenced if they meet certain criteria, such as not having any prior violent felony convictions, Rouson's bill would essentially require judges to give these inmates sentences consistent with current law.\nIt also would mandate that the Florida Department of Corrections notify inmates who may be eligible for re-sentencing, so they can file a motion to appear before a judge.\nThe state Legislature has made multiple changes over the past five years to the state's sentencing laws for possessing or selling certain amounts of prescription opioids like hydrocodone and oxycodone. Yet those changes have left hundreds stranded in prison serving long sentences from laws no longer on the books.\nIn addition to drug trafficking convictions, Rouson's bill would also allow inmates convicted of aggravated assault to be re-sentenced. Florida's law for aggravated assault used to impose strict mandatory minimums, which have since been eased back.\nAs of Thursday, Rouson's bill, Senate Bill 902, had not been assigned any committees. But he said he is more optimistic this year than any before that state lawmakers are ready to make criminal justice reforms like this.\n\"The time is now. The issue is ripe,\" Rouson said. \"Based on what I've heard and seen, there is willingness on part of ... senators to really take hold and do something different.\"\nHe added that the Florida House \"tends to be a little more conservative\" on this issue, but is \"hopeful\" that House members \"will be more open this year than they have in the past.\""

        "text": "When Russia invaded Ukraine in early 2014, Vice President Joe Biden pressed President Barack Obama to take decisive action, and fast, to make Moscow \"pay in blood and money\" for its aggression. The president, a Biden aide recalled, was having none of it.\nBiden worked Obama during their weekly private lunches, imploring him to increase lethal aid, backing a push to ship FGM-148 Javelin anti-tank missiles to Kyiv. The president flatly rejected the idea and dispatched him to the region as an emissary, cautioning him \"about not overpromising to the Ukrainian government,\" Biden would later write in a memoir.\nSo, Biden threw himself into what seemed like standard-issue vice-presidential stuff: prodding Ukraine's leaders to tackle the rampant corruption that made their country a risky bet for international lenders \u2014 and pushing reform of Ukraine's cronyism-ridden energy industry.\n\"You have to be whiter than snow, or the whole world will abandon you,\" Biden told the country's newly elected president, Petro Poroshenko, during an early 2014 phone call, according to former administration officials.\nThat message was delivered just as Biden's son Hunter joined the board of a Ukrainian gas company that was the subject of multiple corruption investigations, a position that paid him as much as $50,000 a month and \u2014 in the view of some administration officials, including the ambassador to Kyiv \u2014 threatened to undermine Biden's agenda.\nThanks to President Donald Trump and his lawyer Rudy Giuliani, that subplot has now swallowed the storyline. Their efforts to press Ukrainian officials to investigate unsubstantiated charges against the Bidens have propelled Trump to the brink of impeachment. They have also put Biden on the defensive at a critical moment in the Democratic presidential primary campaign. As the impeachment hearings go public this week, the Republicans are hoping to redirect the spotlight onto the Bidens.\nA look at what the former vice president actually did in Ukraine (he visited six times and spent hours on the phone with the country's leaders) tells a different story, according to interviews with more than two dozen people knowledgeable about the situation. It casts light on one of Biden's central arguments for himself in the primary: his eight years of diplomacy as Obama's No. 2.\nBiden dived into Ukraine in hopes of burnishing his statesman credentials at a time when he seemed to be winding down his political career, as his elder son, Beau, was dying and his younger one, Hunter, was struggling with addiction and financial problems. It turned out to be an unforgiving landscape \u2014 threatened by Russia, plundered by oligarchs, plagued by indecisive leaders and overrun by outsiders hoping to make a quick buck off the chaos.\nWriting in his 2017 memoir, Biden said Ukraine gave him a chance to fulfill a childhood promise to make a difference in the world. It also came to serve a political purpose, as \"a legacy project, something he could run on,\" said Keith Darden, an associate professor at American University who studies Ukraine policy.\nIn the end, it was an unglamorous holding action, but one that suited Biden's Mr. Fix-It approach to the vice presidency \u2014 and his view of Ukraine as the front line in a larger battle to contain the Russian president, Vladimir Putin.\n\"People forget it now, but at that time period, 2014 and 2015, it wasn't clear Ukraine would survive,\" Darden said. \"They were teetering on the brink of bankruptcy. They had only 8,000 battle-ready troops.\"\nA key to Biden's relevance as vice president was his willingness to take jobs nobody else wanted. In early 2014, as others on Obama's team raced to finish big-splash deals with Cuba and Iran, Biden told the president he wanted to take on three of the most unappetizing foreign-policy tasks left undone: containing the Islamic State group, curbing immigration from Central America and keeping Russia from devouring Ukraine."

        "text": "The start of public impeachment hearings unfolding in Congress marks the first time the American public can watch and listen to the witnesses whose testimony is at the center of the Democrats' investigation.\nIn several hours of testimony, punctuated by occasional bickering among lawmakers, some memorable moments have emerged.\nFull Coverage: Trump impeachment inquiry\nHere are some key takeaways from Wednesday's hearing featuring the first public witnesses: George Kent and William Taylor.\nTRUMP PUSHED FOR BIDEN INVESTIGATION\nHearings like this one can be scripted affairs. But on Wednesday, there was one early surprise.\nTaylor, the top diplomat in Ukraine, revealed for the first time that his staff members overheard the president speaking on the phone to another diplomat about investigations.\nTaylor said some of his staff members were at a restaurant with Gordon Sondland, Ambassador to the European Union, on the day after the July 25 call between President Donald Trump and Ukraine's newly elected president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy.\nSondland used his cellphone to call Trump from the restaurant and the staff members could hear Trump on the phone asking about \"the investigations.\" Taylor took that to mean investigations into the Bidens and the Burisma Group, the Ukrainian firm that had hired Hunter Biden as a director in 2014, he told lawmakers.\nSondland told the president that the Ukrainians were ready to move forward, and after the call, one of Taylor's staffers asked Sondland what Trump thought about Ukraine, he said.\n\"Ambassador Sondland responded that President Trump cares more about the investigations of Biden, which Giuliani was pressing for,\" Taylor said in his opening statement.\n\"I take it the import of that is that he cares more about that than he does about Ukraine?\" Schiff asked Taylor.\n\"Yes, sir,\" he responded.\nTaylor said he only learned about the call last Friday and didn't know about it when he appeared for a closed-door deposition with House investigators conducting the impeachment inquiry.\nIS IT BRIBERY, OR A QUID PRO QUO?\nThe impeachment inquiry in many respects is about controlling the narrative. On Wednesday, Democrats seemed to begin to pivot, framing the actions of Trump as possible \"bribery\" and \"extortion\" rather than emphasizing a \"quid pro quo.\"\nHouse Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff introduced the notion of bribery into the debate when he criticized acting White House Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney for saying that people concerned about Trump's requests that Ukraine do political investigations should \"get over it,\" and that there is political influence in all foreign policy.\nSchiff asked in his opening statement: \"If we find that the President of the United States abused his power ... or if he sought to condition, coerce, extort, or bribe an ally into conducting investigations to aid his reelection campaign and did so by withholding official acts \u2014 a White House meeting or hundreds of millions of dollars of needed military aid \u2014 must we simply \"get over it?\"\nA Democratic staff lawyer, Daniel Goldman, also talked of possible \"extortion and bribery\" \u2014 a gradual change in wording that could preview Democrats' approach going forward.\nLOFTY LANGUAGE\nThe credibility of witnesses is in part a function of their biographies, and Democrat chose the Taylor and Kent for theirs.\nOne a Vietnam War veteran and West Point graduate, the other a career foreign service officer whose family has served the country for generations \u2014 nodded to the history of the moment with language both lofty and personal.\nTheir phrasing laid bare the stakes of the proceedings even as some Republicans sought to minimize them, and their intentional references to serving under presidents of both parties were aimed at pre-empting Republican attacks on them as political partisans. That didn't stop Rep. Devin Nunes, the top Republican on the House intelligence committee, from deriding the witnesses as being part of a smear campaign, \"star chamber\" from within the civil service.\nTaylor capped his opening statement with an ode to how Americans feel in their best moments about their country: \"less concerned about what language we speak, what religion if any we practice, where our parents and grandparents came from; more concerned about building a new country.\"\nFor his part, Kent singled out by first name and even nickname the impeachment witnesses who were born abroad, likening them to 20th century national security policy: Henry Kissinger and Zbigniew Brzezinski, both immigrants.\n\"Masha, Alex, and Fiona were born abroad before their families or they themselves personally chose to immigrate to the United States. They all made the professional choice to serve the United States as public officials, helping shape our national security policy, towards Russia in particular. And we and our national security are the better for it,\" Kent said.\n\"IT WAS CRAZY\"\nCrazy. Counterproductive. Illogical.\nTaylor was unsparing, and colorful, in his characterization of making military aid to Ukraine contingent on the country announcing investigations into the 2016 U.S. election and into Trump's political rival Joe Biden.\nHe was presented with oversized images of a September text message exchange with two other envoys in which he said it would be \"crazy\" to not provide military assistance to the former Soviet republic for domestic political gain. Those text messages were the among the first documentary pieces of evidence to become public as part of the House impeachment inquiry, and established not only the possible contours of a quid pro quo but also laid bare diplomatic concerns about the Trump administration's dealings with Ukraine.\nAsked to elaborate, Taylor said, \"It was counterproductive to all of what we had been trying to do. It was illogical, it could not be explained, it was crazy.\"\nSecurity assistance to Ukraine, he said, was not only critical to that country but also to America's own national interests."

        "text": "If President Trump follows through on his promise to kill the Affordable Care Act, he'll take away some of his biggest jobs successes.\nIt has been a talking point by him and many on the political right that ACA has hurt health care, killed job growth and led to hospital closings.\nThe facts say otherwise.\nIn fact, Arizona would be among the hardest hit if Obamacare is repealed: 160,456 Arizonans would lose the health-care coverage they now access via the ACA marketplace. And 41,982 Arizona jobs would be lost, according to the Economic Policy Institute.\nNationally, 1,175,524 jobs would go away if Obamacare was repealed.\nWhy Arizona's Senate race matters\nFor Arizona, the fate of Affordable Care Act may also be dependent on the 2020 special election for the U.S. Senate seat of the late John McCain, who in 2017 gave his iconic \"thumbs down\" gesture in a key vote toward repealing and replacing the act.\nThe race pits Republican Martha McSally, appointed to the seat in the interim, against Democrat Mark Kelly.\nMcSally has had a nuanced position. A campaign ad says she is \"leading the fight to cover pre-existing conditions.\" She has indeed offered helpful amendments to Republican replacement bills that moved the ball on their pre-existing conditions language.\nBut as a House member in 2015 and 2017, McSally also voted first to repeal, then to \"repeal and replace,\" the Affordable Care Act with a \"skinny repeal\" \u2013 bills that, according to the fact-checking group Politifact Arizona, \"raised premiums\" and overall \"weakened coverage protections.\" \nKelly's website speaks of supporting the existing ACA while introducing a public health option for all Arizonans. Of course, Kelly's actual vote has never been tested.\nThank ACA for big job growth in health care\nThis much is known: Every state, plus the District of Columbia, would see job losses if the ACA were repealed. Thirty states would see upticks of unemployment rates of around 1%. The states that would be hit the hardest, with effects of up to 4%, are Montana, Rhode Island, Oregon, New Jersey, West Virginia, Kentucky, New Mexico and Arizona.\nThe 30 million new health insurance recipients, plus 100 million people with pre-existing conditions now covered, have created new jobs \u2013 and are a prime reason the U.S. now has a 50-year low unemployment rate of 3.5%. Unless Trump wants to see it climb to 4% and higher in most states, leave it alone.\nGoldman Sachs found in a 2017 analysis that a \"substantial decline in insurance coverage would also likely be associated with a drag on health-care employment and health-care consumption.\"\nIn other words, the fewer insured there are, the fewer workers have jobs.\nHealth care drives a lot of economic growth\nThe Bureau of Labor Statistics calculated that there were 16,793,100 health-care employees in March 2010, the month that President Obama signed the Affordable Care Act. As of last month, there are 20,576,200 health-care workers.\nA decade ago, there were 2.4 million more workers in retail than health care. In 2017, health care surpassed both retail and manufacturing, and has become the largest sector of the U.S. labor force, according to BLS. By 2028, there will be 3.4 million more health-care services jobs.\nHealth care was the No. 1 issue in the 2018 congressional elections and remains No. 1 now, according to a Harris poll and most others. \nA court case, Texas v. United States, supported by the Trump Administration and 20 states with Republican attorneys general or governors, including Arizona, is headed for the U.S. Supreme Court.\nPresident Trump markets his administration as a catalyst for generating millions of jobs, but if the Texas case or Congress moves against the Affordable Care Act, jobs and the economy will spiral downward \u2013 and Trump will lose his best talking point.

That's fewer than in recent years for California, but the fires command attention because they are close to people.\nWhile Alaska has had only 700 fires, it has lost 2.57 million acres (1.04 million hectares) to wildfires this year, more than nine times as much as California, according to statistics from the National Interagency Fire Center.\nThe Great Basin, Southern and Southwestern regions have all had more than 440,000 acres (180,000 hectares) burned this year, far more than California.\n\"Fire is increasing everywhere because of climate change, but the impacts on people are more directly observable in California because of its population and wealth,\" said LeRoy Westerling, a fire expert at the University of California, Merced.\nCalifornia did have the most acres burned in 2018, but Montana and Nevada had more acres burned in 2017 and Oklahoma had the most acreage burned in 2016, while Alaska and Washington had more in 2015, according to fire center statistics.\nTRUMP: \"The Governor of California, @GavinNewsom, has done a terrible job of forest management. I told him from the first day we met he must \u2018clean' his forest floors, regardless of what his bosses, the environmentalists, DEMAND of him. Must also do burns and cut fire stoppers.\"\nTHE FACTS: Trump is sidestepping responsibility. Of the 33 million acres (13.3 million hectares) of forest land in California, 57% is owned and managed by the federal government, 40% by private landowners and 3% by the state, according to Newsom's office, Forest Unlimited and the University of California's Forest Research and Outreach center.\nMany of the fires burning the past week or so are not in forests but shrub, agricultural areas and grasslands, so forest management is not an issue, University of Alberta fire expert Mike Flannigan said in an email.\nWesterling showed pictures of the areas before the fire, illustrating mostly grass and shrub. It is not a forest, and clearing debris would be of little use there.\n\"Are there things California should be doing to reduce the risks?\" asked Chris Field, director of the Stanford Wood Institute for the Environment. \"Yes. I agree with the president that fuel reduction and fire breaks are important.\n\"But they are just the beginning. We also need to upgrade homes and businesses to make them more fire resistant, improve defensible spaces around buildings, and limit ignitions, including from downed power lines.\"\nThe recent Tick and Maria fires in Southern California were mainly in chaparral and grassland. In such habitats, Field said, \"widespread fuel reduction doesn't provide a benefit, but defensible spaces and modern building codes can be hugely helpful.\"\nWhile California is increasing its spending for reducing fuels for fire by about $200 million for five years, federal officials are crying for money, Westerling said.\nThe National Forest Service's California office says it needs $300 million more a year to meet its goal of restoring 500,000 acres (200,000 hectares) per year, up from 200,000 acres annually.\nTRUMP: \"Also, open up the ridiculously closed water lanes coming down from the North. Don't pour it out into the Pacific Ocean. Should be done immediately. California desperately needs water, and you can have it now!\"\nTHE FACTS: Trump's point is irrelevant to battling wildfires.\n\"Fire suppression is not limited in any way by the availability of water,\" Westerling said. \"How does President Trump propose that these waters be used to reduce fire risk? Is he proposing to build a statewide sprinkler system with federal money?\""

        "text": "President Trump highlighted a key moment during Wednesday's impeachment hearing to suggest the case against him was decidedly undercut by the witnesses, despite claims to the contrary by House Intelligence Committee Chairman Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., and fellow Democrats.\nAfter reviewing the circumstances of Trump's July 25 phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, Rep. John Ratcliffe, R-Texas, asked the witnesses to state what impeachable offense Trump committed with the call. He did not get an answer.\nIMPEACHMENT HEARING TESTIMONY DETAILS TRUMP PURSUIT OF UKRAINE 'INVESTIGATIONS,' GOP DECRIES 'HEARSAY'\n\".@RepRatcliffe asked the two \u2018star' witnesses, \u2018where is the impeachable event in that call?' Both stared straight ahead with a blank look on their face, remained silent, & were unable to answer the question,\" Trump tweeted Thursday morning. \"That would be the end of a case run by normal people! - but not Shifty!\"\nThe case hinges on Trump's effort to convince Ukraine to launch politically advantageous investigations, and the question of whether he withheld U.S. aid to get what he wanted.\nRatcliffe had asked top U.S. diplomat in Ukraine Bill Taylor about whether Zelensky was aware of any hold on military aid when the July 25 call discussing those probes took place, and Taylor confirmed that he was not. Ratcliffe asserted that this was proof that Trump could not have used the call to pressure Zelensky into investigating the Bidens. Ratcliffe also noted that Trump eventually released the aid without any investigation taking place.\n\"You have to ask yourself, \u2018What did President Zelensky actually do to get the aid?' The answer is nothing,\" Ratcliffe said. \"He did nothing. He didn't open any investigations, he didn't call Attorney General Bill Barr, he didn't do any of the things that House Democrats say that he was being forced, and coerced, and threatened to do. He didn't do anything because he didn't have to.\"\nAt the conclusion of his time, Ratcliffe asked Taylor and State Department official George Kent if they could name any impeachable offense that took place in the July 25 phone call:\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\"In this impeachment hearing today, where we impeach presidents for treason or bribery or other high crimes, where was the impeachable offense in that call?

        "text": "One of the essential storylines of the 2016 presidential election was the hidden Donald Trump voter: the person who wasn't surveyed by pollsters or comfortable telling friends or family about who they thought was best to lead the country.\nThree years ago, thousands of these Americans many working class, residing in the middle of the country helped deliver the most astounding electoral surprise in modern history. Now, as they review the Trump presidency a year before his reelection, some are showing signs of turning on conventional wisdom again.\nHeather, a local administrative assistant here who is married with a stroller-bound toddler, is still so embarrassed by her 2016 vote that she wasn't comfortable revealing her last name.\n\"I'm ashamed to admit ... but I'm of a more conservative bent and family. I just couldn't vote for Hillary. But I also thought there's no way Trump was going to win. This way, I could at least say, 'Well I didn't vote for her,'\" she said. \"I didn't think I was doing any harm.\"\n[ With viewers having partisan choices to watch Trump impeachment inquiry, TV may have a lesser impact than it did during Watergate ]\nWhile Heather isn't sharing her conversion far and wide, she's already decided \"there's no chance\" she'd vote for Trump again. \"Heavens no,\" she said. \"Trump basically turned me into a Democrat.\"\nThe 2020 presidential campaign has been engrossed in a debate over which demographic groups Democrats should devote most of their attention to in order to reclaim the White House. African-Americans in urban areas? Rural voters who flipped from Barack Obama to Trump? Newly emerging but unreliable young people?\nBut the one pivotal group showing the most evident signs of splitting from the president are white working-class women, according to a review of polling data, focus groups and interviews with more than a dozen party strategists and voters like Heather.\nIt's these voters packed in eastern Iowa, central Minnesota, southwestern Wisconsin, northern Ohio and throughout Michigan who will wield outsize influence over Trump's 2020 fate. Republican pollster Patrick Ruffini calls these women the essential voter as it relates to the Electoral College.\n\"If I could talk to one voter in the country, it would be a non-college-educated white woman,\" he said. \"It's definitely the kind of voter Trump can't lose.\"\nTrump carried non-college-educated white women by 27 points in 2016. They've been slipping away ever since.\n[ Column: The 'Whistleblower' and Rep. Adam Schiff should be first to testify in Trump Impeachment Theater ]\nIn the midterm elections, they were the hidden fuel behind the Democratic comeback. Exit polls showed white women both with and without a college degree shifted 13 points in the Democratic direction from 2016-2018. But white women without a college degree made up a greater percentage of the midterm electorate.\nDemocrats don't need to carry these voters in 2020, but they must chip away at the president's margins with them in battleground states.\nAs the impeachment process accelerates, it's white women without a college degree who are gradually warming to the idea that the president's time is up. Forty percent now favor impeachment, up 11 points from mid-September, according to an independent study in late October.\nWhite working-class women make up nearly one-fifth of the presidential electorate, but are far from ideologues of any stripe. Broadly, they care more about their personal incomes than sweeping big-ticket proposals like the Green New Deal. Polls show they respond warmly to raising taxes on the wealthy and corporations and yet are still more likely than other groups to approve of Trump's economy.\nIt was Trump's positioning as a populist that helped bring them into the Republican fold. Now, more say their wages aren't keeping up with the cost of living, leaving them open to other options.\nWhite working-class men have largely stuck with the president through all of his travails from Charlottesville, Va., through the entirety of special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation and the current embroilment of an alleged quid pro quo with Ukraine.\nBut their female counterparts increasingly view Trump as divisive, impulsive and hostile.\n\"He's definitely lost people because of his rhetoric. There's no cause for it,\" said Corrie Torres, a teacher in Dubuque, Iowa, and Democratic voter. \"I don't think people here will continue to buy into someone who is unkind.\"\n[ How Mitch McConnell is managing impeachment and a fragmenting Republican response ]\nDriving northbound on Route 63 into Howard County, Iowa, there's a lone placard encouraging adoption on the right and a single pole with an American flag whipping in the wind on the left amid miles of corn fields and farmland. Howard has suffered from a population drain that's precipitated a broad-based consolidation of the schooling system and left local factories struggling to find qualified workers. Politically, it's also felt neglected.\nBut this cycle looks different. This swath of eastern Iowa is home to 31 swing counties that supported Obama twice before switching their allegiance to Trump the most of any state in the country.\nThe largely industrial region much like its neighbors in Wisconsin and Minnesota is home to a bastion of white working-class voters who have shown a penchant for choosing individual candidates over long-held party labels.\nIn Dubuque, the largest county in the area, Trump managed a 16-point shift to win it by just over 1 point. But in no place in the country was there a more dramatic swing than in Howard County, a sparsely populated area along the Iowa-Minnesota border. Four years after Obama's 21-point win, Trump carried it by 20 points in 2016, amounting to the biggest swing in the country.\nApril Cheeseman is a resident of Lime Springs (population: 477) who used her high school degree to land a job at an electronics manufacturing company in neighboring Minnesota. Trump was never an option for her in 2016, but Clinton repelled her as well.\nSo she cast her ballot for third-party candidate Gary Johnson, four years after supporting Obama.\nThis time, she's leaning towards caucusing for Pete Buttigieg next February because of his military service and student debt plan, but will likely support whoever Democrats nominate.\nIt's a dynamic heard over and over in these counties: 2016 votes were widely driven by a loathing of Clinton, even if they thought little of Trump.\n\"What I heard on the doors was: 'Hillary? Never Hillary. And even though Trump says stupid s---, he's not Hillary,'\" said Laura Hubka, a sonographer and chair of the Howard County Democratic Party, who has endorsed Buttigieg. \"I feel the same thing about (Joe) Biden here people are like, 'nope.'\"\n[ 'Everything else is made up garbage': Fact-checking President Trump on impeachment ]\nHubka has had her own fissures with the Democratic Party in Iowa, leaving it temporarily after 2016 due to what she saw as unresolvable infighting between the Clinton and Bernie Sanders factions. Yet she's becoming increasingly heartened about a political recovery, in part due to refocused attention on far-flung areas by 2020 candidates.\nA June event in Cresco featuring Buttigieg, Amy Klobuchar and now former presidential candidate John Hickenlooper was seen as a breakthrough in the secluded region.\n\"The candidates have been doing a better job of coming to rural areas, which they never have before,\" Hubka said, naming Buttigieg and Elizabeth Warren's campaigns as the two doing the most personal interaction in Howard.\nIn Hubka's eyes, a victory in 2020 would be shaving off at least 10 points of Trump's 2016 margin in Howard County, an outcome that could endanger the president's ability to again carry Iowa's six electoral votes if it was replicated in surrounding counties.\nTrump carried Iowa by 9 points in 2016, but there are already signs that it'll be closer this time. A recent New York Times/Siena College poll showed Trump's lead in the state falling to just a single point against Biden and three points over Sanders. But against Warren, Trump's advantage is 7 points.\n\"Iowans do want a change but they don't want a drastic change. They want something better but ... they don't want a complete liberal takeover,\" said Sarah Orwig, a Sioux City firefighter who has endorsed Biden. \"(Warren) might just be a little too much, to tell you the truth.\"\nAs the polling numbers demonstrate, the profile of the eventual Democratic nominee will matter to these voters, as will the issues he or she chooses to prioritize.\nDemocratic Gov. Tom Wolf of Pennsylvania, who has said he will refrain from endorsing in the primary, expressed concern that the rigid ideological tests being put forward by candidates is not how most voters come to their opinions on policy.\n\"I don't think Pennsylvanians go for litmus tests. ... I think Pennsylvanians respond, and I think most Americans respond, to pragmatic things,\" he said. \"There's nothing that is a litmus test, that you're either here or you're there.\"\nWhile stopping short of criticizing any particular candidate, he added: \"I've got to admit, I'm not real clear on exactly what each of the candidates means when they say Medicare for All.\"\nSteve Grubbs, a longtime Republican consultant in Davenport, Iowa, is even more explicit about the type of Democrat who would present the greatest challenge to Trump in the Midwest.\n\"Buttigieg would be strong, (Amy) Klobuchar would be strong. Biden would certainly be stronger than Warren or Sanders,\" he said. \"In Iowa, a northeast liberal is unlikely to sell well here. There is always some geographic bias.\"\nIt's this perspective that has fortified Biden's position as the national front-runner for the nomination, even as Warren and Sanders have conjured up more grassroots energy and the former vice president has lost ground in early nominating states.\nBiden has sought to make white working-class voters a central part of his coalition. The \"dignity of work\" is a regular staple of his stump speech. The former vice president recently chose his hometown of Scranton, Pa., to hammer Trump for rewarding \"wealth instead of work\" in a county where just 27% of residents hold college degrees.\nBut he's had stiff competition in the Democratic primary for these voters. The latest Quinnipiac University poll showed Warren overtaking Biden with white working-class voters, with Sanders not far behind. Yet in a general election in Iowa, Biden and Sanders carry these voters, whereas Warren loses them to Trump.\nFor her part, Warren is making the opposite bet of Biden: That winning back these Trump voters requires a bold message underpinned by broad structural economic change. However, Warren still performs weaker against Trump than Biden in hypothetical general election polls in critical Midwestern states.\n\"She's made herself more plausible to working-class voters. I don't think it's that they love her now,\" said Ruy Teixeira, a senior fellow at the liberal Center for American Progress, who specializes in political demographics.\nBut Teixeira warned that if Warren did not walk back some of her most liberal positions as the Democratic nominee, it would prove to be a \"significant vulnerability with white working-class women voters\" who feel burned. They wanted to believe Trump's promises but now think \"they've been sold a bill of goods,\" he said, making them more skeptical of grand promises.\n\"Either party, I think, is just pathetic,\" said Jackie Tallman, a Cresco, Iowa, resident who voted for Clinton in 2016 but is now leaning toward Trump as she's watched the Democrats endorse a litany of expensive proposals. \"I never thought I would be ... but where's all the money going to come from?\"\n\"Making all these promises and doing all this stuff for everybody,\" she said. \"It's so unrealistic. It's a fantasyland.\"\nAnd then there are Democrats like Cory Booker, who are sounding the alarm that an overreliance on white working-class voters in the Midwest risks ignoring black voters in places Milwaukee, Detroit and Philadelphia who didn't show up at the level Democrats needed in 2016.\n\"That's how we won as Democrats in 2008, 2012 and most recently in 2018,\" the presidential candidate said recently during a speech in Washington.\nWhat's clear is that the Trump campaign has no choice but to keep white working-class women in the fold.\nSo it recently established an eight-member \"Workers for Trump\" advisory board that will lead an effort to train blue-collar supporters to phone bank and canvass neighborhoods. The double-pronged strategy is to highlight the administration's economic gains while tearing into the more polarizing parts of the Democratic agenda, including the elimination of private insurance through Medicare for All and of fossil fuels by implementing the Green New Deal.\nA Trump campaign aide said that unions will be a critical target for this messaging and that educating them on the ramifications of the Democratic agenda will draw them back into the GOP camp.\nAngela Tinsley, a single parent, truck driver and Teamsters member who is leading the Trump campaign's effort in Nevada, said the biggest obstacle to winning converts is overcoming the media environment.\n\"Unfortunately many of them have been misinformed as to President Trump's current record,\" Tinsley said. \"When you say we have the lowest unemployment ... they are surprised by this, like they've never heard of it.\"\nTinsley acknowledged that \"while not everybody agrees with his language ... the proof is in the pudding.\"\n\"Since Trump, I'm now receiving a tax refund every year,\" she said. \"As a single parent, that's like a Christmas gift.\"\nBut back in Dubuque, Heather counts herself as someone who is already gone. She now describes herself as a \"closeted Democrat\" still surveying her options. Recently, she showed up at the city's historic brewing company along the Mississippi River to catch a Buttigieg campaign event.\nAs she's done more research on her own, she's determined she opposes tax cuts for the rich and favors a government safety net for the neediest, but finds Warren and Sanders too extreme.\n\"My family would have an absolute fit if they knew I were here right now,\" she said standing at the periphery of the Buttigieg event as the sun set. \"Republican has been my identity for a long time, so it's kind of weird to be on the other side.\"\nButtigieg showed up 50 minutes late, leaving some onlookers antsy, due to the Monday Night Football game, which was approaching kickoff.\nStill, she departed toward the parking lot with Buttigieg's sticker affixed to her blouse, undecided on exactly which Democrat to caucus for, but settled on the type of candidate she wanted.\n\"He seems like a nice, down-to-earth family guy. I like that,\" she said of Buttigieg. \"He's the antithesis of Donald Trump.\n"

        "text": "Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot is making a day-trip tomorrow to the state Capitol for the final crucial leg of the General Assembly's fall session. She'll focus her efforts on convincing lawmakers to amend the revenue formula for a planned city casino, her City Hall spokeswoman tells The Spin. By slicing up the pie differently, taxing bodies would get less than currently allotted but owners would get more \u2014 a move one study suggests would make it more palatable to investors.\n\nIt appears her request for the legislature to allow the city to hike the transfer tax on expensive real estate deals has stalled \u2014 at least for now. Lightfoot was counting on that $50 million in much-needed revenue next year as part of her 2020 budget plan but a group of Chicago Democratic lawmakers pushed to direct 60% of those revenues to alleviate homelessness in the city \u2014 something the mayor said she couldn't do.\n\nLightfoot has more than hinted that if any of the funding streams she's proposing in next year's budget don't materialize she may look to a property tax increase, described by the Tribune Editorial Board and others as the \"nuclear\" option.\n\nLater this week, 25,000 Chicago Public Schools teachers will vote on whether to accept a new contract and formally end the strike \u2014 it's only suspended right now. A majority of teachers could reject it, too, and return to the picket lines. Jesse Sharkey, the CTU president, has said it won't be a \"slam dunk\" and Vice President Stacy Davis Gates describes teachers as being in the \"deliberation phase.\"\n\nNikki Haley, President Donald Trump's former U.N. ambassador, will be in the Chicago area next week hawking a new memoir that's once again putting a spotlight on discord in the Trump administration. During her time as ambassador, she writes, two cabinet members eventually forced out by the Trump administration attempted to get her to join them in opposing some of the president's policies.\n\nWelcome to The Spin.\n\nLightfoot heads to Springfield; what to expect in the session's final days\nChicago's mayor will be in Springfield as the legislature marks its final three days of the fall veto session. Mayor Lightfoot has two key pieces of legislation she'd like passed in order to shore up the 2020 budget and beyond.\nKey issue, Part I: She'll be asking the legislature to approve her proposal to hike the real estate transfer tax on property sales of more than $500,000. But, to date, she hasn't been able to work out a deal with a group of Chicago Democratic lawmakers demanding 60% of the revenues be directed to relieving homelessness in the city. Unless that happens, it's doubtful the measure will cross the finish line this year.\nKey issue, Part II: Rolling the dice \u2014 Lightfoot isn't counting on gambling revenues next year, but the mayor would like to see the legislature redo the taxing formula that would mean taxing bodies would get a smaller piece of the pie and investors would get a larger chunk. There is some momentum to pass the measure, which by some accounts would provide the lure investors need to buy in and open the city's first casino.\nWord of the week in the General Assembly? Reform. With a sprawling federal public corruption probe that has snagged Democrats from City Hall to Springfield, there's renewed energy behind government reforms. We've heard that song before, but it isn't stopping Republicans, who can gleefully trot out ethics legislation while noting none in their party have been caught up in the probe to date, and Democrats from declaring it's time for change.

But by the time she left, she was with Sanders.\n\"I'm speechless right now,\" she said as her friends bolted toward her with a freshly snapped selfie with Ocasio-Cortez in hand. \"Seeing how passionate he is, how passionate she is, it just amazes me. ... She's inspirational to all Latinas, to all women.\"\nOcasio-Cortez's star power was put to the test in Middle America this weekend \u2014 and she and Sanders drew thousands of excited fans to three stops across Iowa. Audience members donned purple shirts emblazoned with the Bronx congresswoman's name and shouted \"I love you!\" to her.\nThe raucous crowds demonstrated that Ocasio-Cortez can boost excitement and win media attention for Sanders' campaign in the early-voting states, even if she comes with the downside of turning off some moderate voters. All three stops this weekend were larger than any Sanders had previously held in Iowa this year, bringing between 2,000 and 2,400 people each, according to the campaign. Sanders aides said the Council Bluffs rally drew more people than any other presidential campaign event in the state in 2019.\n\"Some campaigns struggle to make 1,000 face-to-face contacts in a week,\" boasted Misty Rebik, Sanders' Iowa state director. \"We just tripled that in 24 hours.\"\nOcasio-Cortez's reception in the first-in-the-nation caucus state also fueled hopes among her supporters that she will run for president herself in the not-so-distant future.\nSanders' aides worked to convert the excited rally-goers into dedicated volunteers and caucus-goers, passing around volunteer sign-up sheets at each stop this weekend. The campaign told POLITICO that it registered more than 3,000 new volunteers at the events as well as about 500 people to help out specifically on the night of the caucuses.\nSanders' team believes that Ocasio-Cortez's endorsement will excite the base and turn out young and progressive Democrats. But some of Sanders' aides and allies hope it will also persuade new voters to give him a look.\n\"She's going to do both,\" said Stacey Walker, Sanders' Iowa campaign co-chair, adding that \"there is a generation of young political activists that see AOC as the future of the party\" and \"we will see an expanded turnout among the Latino community.\"\nBut some Democratic officials doubt that the nod by Ocasio-Cortez, a democratic socialist, will pull in new voters for Sanders. Others said it could backfire among centrist caucus-goers.\n\"Western Iowa isn't exactly New York City,\" said Scott Punteney, leader of the Pottawattamie County Democratic Party, in explaining concerns about Ocasio-Cortez he's heard from other officials. \"Some of her ideas might not sit well with a lot of more moderate Democrats, which is kind of what we have in the area.\"\nThe Council Bluffs rally was about a 10-minute drive from Omaha, Nebraska, and some in the crowd said they were residents of the Cornhusker State.\nIn interviews with nearly 20 voters at Sanders' events this weekend, about half said Ocasio-Cortez's endorsement made no difference to them. But women, in particular, said it was meaningful.\n\"Definitely,\" Diana Bolinger, a middle-aged mother, said when asked if it's a part of her considerations about whom to support. She said she is eyeing Sanders, Buttigieg and Kamala Harris. Ocasio-Cortez is \"on top of things,\" Bolinger said.\nOcasio-Cortez made a pitch for Sanders that was similar to the remarks she gave at a rally with him in New York City last month. That event drew about 26,000 people, according to Sanders' campaign, which would make it the biggest event of the cycle.\n\"When my parents struggled with being able to have health insurance, let alone me, Bernie was fighting for them,\" Ocasio-Cortez said in Iowa. \"He fought for me when I didn't have health care as a waitress. He fought for me when I graduated with over $20,000 in student debt.\"\nBernie Sanders' Medicare for All plan would eliminate private insurance\nSee where he stands on all the issues \u00bb\nOcasio-Cortez also took jabs at some of Sanders' rivals. She made a thinly veiled dig at Pete Buttigieg's \"Medicare for All Who Want It\" plan, saying \"we're not going to get there with Medicare for some.\" She said change comes \"not through a technocratic policy proposal, but through a political revolution,\" which some on social media interpreted as a contrast with Elizabeth Warren, though Ocasio-Cortez has repeatedly praised her and was initially eyeing Warren and Sanders when deciding whom to potentially endorse.\nReps. Ilhan Omar and Rashida Tlaib, who are also part of the so-called \"Squad,\" have held well-attended rallies with Sanders in their home states. Faiz Shakir, Sanders' campaign manager, said they will stump for Sanders in the early-voting states \"soon.\"\nOcasio-Cortez knocked on voters' doors in Des Moines during her swing through Iowa. One woman promised to caucus for Sanders, while a former party leader she ran into on the street told her that Sanders was his second choice after Joe Biden.\n\"Having knocked a lot of doors in New York City, knocking doors in Iowa is a much nicer thing. In New York, they're like, \u2018I don't want to change my cable. Leave me alone,'\" Ocasio-Cortez joked at a rally in Coralville. \"But in Iowa, you just knock on a door and people are just open for a conversation. It's really amazing and it's beautiful.\""

        "title": "Suburban voters were key to Democratic takeover in Virginia -- and both parties will need to keep wooing them",
        "text": "On the campaign trail to help fellow Democrats in Tuesday's election, College of William and Mary political scientist John McGlennon kept hearing a line he thinks will have a lot to do with how the General Assembly tackles issues next year.\n\"I knocked on a lot of doors of people who I think usually vote Republican and what I was hearing was: \u2018For now, I'm only voting for Democrats,'\" McGlennon said.\n\"And that \u2018for now' is what stuck in my head.\"\nSuburban voters, like the ones in the corner of the Historic Triangle that McGlennon represents on the James City County Board of Supervisors, have become the key to Virginia politics, political scientists say.\nThey've been pretty Republican until recently.\nAnd in the wake of Tuesday's election, they pose tough challenges to each of parties' legislative caucuses.\nThe group of Republican lawmakers that comes to Richmond in 2020 will be much more rural and conservative than in recent years. Especially on cultural issues like guns, gay rights and abortion, they'll have to figure out how to keep their conservative constituents happy without alienating suburban voters, who tend to have more moderate positions \u2014 and will be key to the GOP's hopes of retaking power in the future.\nAnd the Democratic caucuses in each chamber will include highly energized newcomers, many of whom ran on liberal platforms that call for major spending to fix major problems, as well as changes in law that would favor labor unions. So the party will have to decide how far and how fast to go without risking alienating suburban voters who don't want to see taxes rise and who worry about reforms that might make life more difficult for Virginia businesses.\n\"One of the political realities if you've been out of power for two decades is having a huge amount of pent-up demand on policies. As a result, there's a great risk of over-reaching,\" said Stephen Farnsworth, a political scientist at the University of Mary Washington.\n\"That could open them up for an attack from Republicans two years from now that that they're big spender liberals ... and that wouldn't go over big with less-taxes, smaller government suburban voters.\"\n\"In off-year elections, you get turnout when people are angry,\" he added.\nSome campaign promises will be easy ones for the new Democratic majorities: gun control, the Equal Rights Amendment and easier access to abortion tend to play fairly well in suburbs, even with soccer-mom Republicans, Farnsworth said.\n\"We saw huge numbers of energized voters in the suburbs \u2014 suburban women especially were the backbone of that,\" said Quentin Kidd, a political scientist at Christopher Newport University.\nDemocratic legislators say a bill or bills dealing with voting and possibly campaign finance reform and government transparency look likely to be among the first they'll introduce, in that highly ritual signal of a party caucus' marquee cause.\nAnd while Republican activists don't like Democrats' long-frustrated efforts to make it easier to vote absentee and to register to vote, those aren't issues that stir lots of broader interest. The idea of restoring felons' voting rights fits easily with the concern of many Republicans in helping former inmates reenter their communities. Campaign finance reform, in the wake of the flood of money that flowed into Democrats' funds, might also gain support from the GOP.\nVoters in the suburban Democratic strongholds of Northern Virginia are going to want to see more of a state effort to tackle traffic and overcrowded schools, Farnsworth said.\nSome of that will come at a cost to programs that had been a priority of rural Virginia, he thinks. Kidd thinks changes there, for instance a shift to population-based allocation of transportation funds or a slowdown on the rural broadband push, would come only fairly slowly, if at all.\nAffordable housing could also be an issue suburban voters would like to see the state tackle, political scientists say.\nSome Democratic priorities may be a tougher sell, especially given Secretary of Finance Aubrey Layne's warnings that tax collections aren't growing as fast as they were.\n\"Fully funding public schools\" was a catchphrase for many Democratic candidates, but the additional cost to simply maintain current state Standards of Quality is about $600 million over the next two years while the state Board of Education has recommended an additional $900-plus million on top of that.\nThe SOQ maintenance cost \u2014 it's called rebenchmarking around Capitol Square \u2014 and a likely increase in the state's bill for Medicaid, despite the multiple billions of federal monies coming thank's to last year's Medicaid expansion look set to account for much of the early projections for tax revenues.\nMuch additional money for school beyond rebenchmarking, if it means rethinking tax rates, could be a reach too far, for many suburban voters.\nWorries about suburban blowback is why there may not be a rush to fill the promise many Democratic candidates made to repeal Virginia's \"right to work\" law \u2014 the law that says workers who are paid union wages thanks to a union contract don't have to pay dues to that union \u2014 despite Republican candidates' dire warnings that Democrats would do exactly that as a boon to their labor supporters.\nBut whether repeal languishes quietly or whether progressive Democrats make a lot of noise could be an early signal of how deep any fissures between factions in the caucuses really are, and whether they could disrupt the party the same way the Tea Party movement a decade ago did for the GOP, Kidd said.\nHe'll also be among the political scientists watching to see what Democratic legislators do about nonpartisan redistricting. After years of opposition by the GOP majority on the House Privileges and Elections Committee, the General Assembly last year started the two-year process of amending the state Constitution to create a commission to draw legislative and Congressional district lines.\nThe General Assembly must vote again on the idea before it can go on a ballot for voters to decide whether to amend the Constitution. If they do, the commission could be in place in to draw new lines using 2020 Census data.\nBut if Democrats say they have a better idea for how to structure the commission, that would restart the two-year clock and leave the General Assembly itself, with its new Democratic majorities, free to draw district lines to suit the majority, Farnsworth, at UMW, said.\nAnd that could be just too tempting.\nKidd, meanwhile, will also be watching Republican legislators' votes on gun legislation and the ERA to see if any are moving away from some of the hardline positions that hurt them with many suburban voters. Doing so could be critical for the party's future, he and other political scientists believe.\n\"Suburban voters are who determines who has control in ond,\" Kidd said."

        "text": "House Republicans on Saturday pressed ahead with their efforts to move the impeachment inquiry away from President Trump, calling on Democrats to add witnesses to the probe including former vice president Joe Biden's son and the whistleblower whose initial complaint kicked off the investigation.\nThe GOP demands were met with immediate skepticism from House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam B. Schiff (D-Calif.), who warned against \"sham investigations\" of the Bidens and other issues in a clear signal that many of the witnesses were unlikely to be called.\nThe clash came as Democrats prepare to enter a new phase of the impeachment inquiry with public hearings beginning Wednesday, which will focus on Trump's alleged efforts to pressure Ukrainian officials to dig up dirt on Joe Biden and other Democrats in exchange for military aid or a White House visit by the Ukrainian president. Witnesses who have testified out of public view have largely corroborated the whistleblower's initial allegations.\nRepublicans have complained that the Democratic-run inquiry is unfairly partisan, and Trump said Saturday that he will \"probably\" release a transcript next week of an April call that he made to congratulate Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky on his election victory.\nIn the weeks ahead, the GOP's focus will be to try to minimize Trump's role in the Ukraine pressure campaign and to justify his actions by highlighting that country's history of corruption problems, according to Republicans familiar with the party's strategy who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal deliberations.\nMore than 2,500 pages of interview transcripts released over the past week provide a road map for the emerging Republican strategy. The documents show the extent to which GOP lawmakers involved in the hearings have focused on unsubstantiated conspiracy theories, Democratic political targets and other subjects favored by Trump allies \u2014 much of it ancillary to the probe at hand, according to a Washington Post review of the documents.\nOne GOP lawmaker repeatedly tried to pressure a witness into saying what he wanted to hear about a Ukrainian company that employed Biden's son. Another member quizzed a former ambassador in the impeachment inquiry about her national heritage, seeming to probe for bias. And a third Republican interrogated the same diplomat about whether her staff \"monitored\" the social media account of an alt-right conspiracy theorist, whose main claim to fame is smearing a Washington pizzeria as the site of a fictional Democratic pedophile ring.\nThere were also questions about the Clinton Foundation and long-gone officials from the Obama administration; probing of witnesses over the attorneys they hired or the release of opening statements; and inquiries about whether witnesses improperly \"unmasked\" the identities of Trump officials under investigation.\nThe sprawling list of potential witnesses named by Republicans on Saturday continued the pattern. They included Hunter Biden, whose father is a leading Democratic candidate to challenge Trump in 2020; Hunter Biden's business partner Devon Archer; the unnamed whistleblower, who Trump and some of his allies have campaigned to publicly identify; the researcher Nellie Ohr of Fusion GPS, which commissioned a dossier linking Russia and Trump; and Alexandra Chalupa, a Ukrainian American who worked with the Democratic National Committee.\nRepublicans also asked to call two witnesses who have already testified behind closed doors, a request that appears likely to be granted by Democrats: National Security Council official Tim Morrison and former Ukraine envoy Kurt Volker, each of whom corroborated parts of the whistleblower's complaint while also providing some cover for Republicans.\nRep. Devin Nunes (Calif.), the ranking Republican on the intelligence panel, argued that witnesses such as Biden and Archer would \"assist the American public in understanding the nature and extent of Ukraine's pervasive corruption, information that bears directly on President Trump's long-standing and deeply-held skepticism of the country.\"\nSchiff said Democrats would evaluate the requests but added in a statement that the inquiry \"will not serve \u2026 as a vehicle to undertake the same sham investigations into the Bidens or 2016 that the President pressed Ukraine to conduct for his personal political benefit, or to facilitate the President's effort to threaten, intimidate, and retaliate against the whistleblower who courageously raised the initial alarm.\"\n"

        "text": "At campaign events this week in the Carolinas, Elizabeth Warren refused to engage rivals Joe Biden and Pete Buttigieg as they depict her as a divisive and condescending elitist. But she and her supporters see a dollop of sexism in the criticism.\nAfter Biden, the former vice president, accused Warren of pushing an \"angry unyielding viewpoint,\" Warren sent a fundraising email to supporters Friday with the subject line: \"I am angry and I own it.\"\n\"Over and over, we are told that women are not allowed to be angry. It makes us unattractive to powerful men who want us to be quiet,\" Warren wrote, without mentioning Biden by name.\nThe accusation reflects how some Warren supporters feel amid a onslaught from Biden and Buttigieg \u2014 sparked by a debate over her Medicare for All financing plan \u2014 that appears to have blunted her rise in the polls. The attacks come at a moment when many voters are making up their minds ahead of the first contest in Iowa, and are a test of Warren's resilience after she avoided combat with Democratic rivals for most of the year.\n\"I think that's just very sexist,\" Peggy Mormann, who's based in Raleigh, said of the critique of Warren as angry and condescending. \"They realize she's a huge threat to them.\"\nMaytee Sanz, a construction worker in Charlotte, said: \"That happens when women lead. Men are afraid of strong women.\"\nThe criticisms may be working. A study by FiveThirtyEight found Warren has dipped in the polls by an average of 1.7 percentage points since the Oct. 15 debate, while Biden and Buttigieg have risen slightly. Iowa polls show her hanging on to a slim lead, with Buttigieg close behind.\nBiden said his issue with Warren is simply about the cost of her Medicare for All plan. \"The strong women in my life are angry -- they get angry about things,\" he told CNN's Dana Bash when asked about Warren's charge. He said criticizing her in sexist terms was \"not anything I did or was intending to do.\"\nThe jabs present a difficult choice for Warren's campaign: Let the claims go unanswered and suffer political damage, or wade into an extended back-and-forth that advisers worry will drown out her message and drive up her negative ratings.\nDeadlocked Polls\nThe dilemma comes as a Siena College/New York Times poll raises fresh questions about her ability to win a general election, showing her deadlocked or trailing President Donald Trump in key states like Florida and Pennsylvania, where Biden narrowly leads the president.\nAsked in Raleigh on Thursday about Biden's attacks, Warren brushed it off. \"I am here to talk about why I'm in this race,\" she said, adding that she has campaigned in 28 states, held hundreds of town halls and taken over 75,000 selfies or photos with supporters.\nTo some strategists, the attacks are just part of the campaign.\n\"Biden wants to remain the front-runner and Buttigieg admitted he wants this to be a two-person race,\" said Mary Anne Marsh, a Democratic strategist who is unaffiliated with a 2020 candidate. \"She's being very selective in the way she engages. But in the debate on Nov. 20, I expect her to respond in some way.\"\nThe clash grew heated after Biden accused Warren of fabricating the math behind her health care plan. Warren escalated the conflict by suggesting Biden was \"running in the wrong presidential primary.\" The remark struck a nerve with the former vice president, who has brought it up at fundraising events.\nRead more: Pelosi Is Worried 2020 Candidates Are on Wrong Track\nFrom Biden, new arrows are launched almost daily \u2014 by the candidate himself, by surrogates on TV, and by staff via social media and campaign statements. The Warren campaign has refrained from sniping on Twitter or sending allies to go after Biden on TV.\nButtigieg, who laced into Warren at the last debate, said recently that she would further polarize the country. In a appearance on ABC's \"This Week,\" he accused her of adopting a \"my way or the highway\" attitude on health care and lacking \"humility\" with her calls for putting all Americans into Medicare, whether or not they like their private plan.\nBiden's stumbles have caused concern among Democrats about their ability to beat Trump. Former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg is reconsidering a campaign for president after closing the door to the idea earlier in the year. He is the founder and majority owner of Bloomberg LP, the parent company of Bloomberg News.\nRead more: Buttigieg, Other Democrats Look to \u2018Era That Must Come Next'\nWarren's campaign swing in North Carolina and South Carolina was an opportunity for her to make some inroads among a constituency where she's weak and Biden is strong: non-white voters.\nAt a Latino forum in Raleigh hosted by the group Mijente, she said she'd be \"open to suspending deportations\" to push Congress to pass an immigration overhaul \u2014 a plank that wasn't in her immigration policy plan.\nAt a roundtable with educators at Scotts Branch High School in Summerton, South Carolina, she pressed her case for a national health insurance plan, saying that \"the idea behind Medicare for All is just to say health care is a basic human right.\"\n\"If you switch to Medicare for All, you don't go through the state government any more,\" she said, implying that Republican governors or legislators wouldn't be able to hinder its implementation like they have with Obamacare. \"That's an important distinction when you're in a place like South Carolina.\""

In those days, the feds went after smugglers and those who turned a profit from illegal immigration.\nThat all changed in April 2017, when then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions declared it a priority to go after anyone harboring undocumented immigrants.\n\"This is a new era,\" Sessions declared in Nogales, where he announced a series of crackdowns. \"This is the Trump era.\"\nNine months later, Warren was arrested. He is one of nine No More Deaths volunteers being prosecuted since Trump's inauguration, though Warren is the only one facing felony charges.\nEarlier this year, prosecutors put Warren on trial for conspiracy and harboring but the jury deadlocked in June, refusing to convict him of crimes that would have put him in prison for 20 years.\nThis is prosecutors' second shot at Warren\nNow the government is going after him again, dropping the conspiracy count in the hope of getting this dangerous character off the street \u2013 or more precisely, out of the desert \u2013 for 10 years.\nWarren's trial began Tuesday in U.S. District Court in Tucson.\nThis time, prosecutors are hoping to bar use the T word \u2013 Trump \u2013 in court. They've asked Judge Raner C. Collins to bar any mention of Trump or his immigration policies, contending that would be \"irrelevant and unfairly prejudicial.\"\nIt seems they believe the mere mention of Trump or his policies would damage their case. \nNever mind, apparently, that it is because of Trump and his policies that Warren is on trial. Or that it was prosecutors who brought up Trump's name in the first trial \u2013 the one that ended with a jury voting 8-4 not to convict.\n((UPDATE: The judge late Tuesday issued a ruling barring any mention of Trump or his policies during the trial, saying \"no politics should be allowed in this case.\"))\nNo More Deaths came under investigation after an anonymous tip in April 2017, the same month as Sessions announced the crackdown.\nA jury will be asked to decide his motive\nWarren was arrested in January 2018 by Border Patrol agents who had been watching a house on the outskirts of Ajo used by No More Deaths as a staging area.\nWarren said he offered food, water and temporary shelter to a pair of Central American migrants who showed up and were in physical distress. Prosecutors contend Warren conspired to shield them from the Border Patrol and that the migrants were never in distress.\nANOTHER VIEW:Why was Scott Warren tried even once?\nIt'll be up to a jury \u2013 again \u2013 to decide whether Scott Warren crossed the line and became a criminal when he provided two immigrants here illegally with food, water and shelter.\nWhether to convict and imprison a man who acted not out of a profit motive but out of a Christian motive, a belief that coming to the aid his fellow man is the good and right thing to do.\nEven here, in Donald Trump's America.\n"

He is currently the deputy chair of the Open Society Foundations, the philanthropy network founded by his father that creates grants for civil society groups globally. Unlike the true whistleblower, Soros has no direct ties to the Central Intelligence Agency or the U.S. government more broadly.\nSIGN UP FOR NEWSWEEK'S EMAIL UPDATES >\nKing changed his language slightly in his later tweet. \"Adam Schiff said, 'I do not know the identity of the whistleblower.'

Swan then shared a warning to others who would promote King's unsubstantiated allegation: \"This member of Congress is putting a target on somebody without doing a basic Google check.\"\nPolitifact reported that accusations of Soros being the whistleblower date to a November 10 Facebook post that featured the same photos of Soros alongside Pelosi and Clinton posted to the group \"Trump Daily Report.\" The original poster wrote \"My, my, my said the liar to the fly.

Trump 2020.\" The post has since been removed from Facebook in accordance with the platform's policy of removing any post naming the whistleblower.\nThe call to publicly identify the whistleblower\u2014despite concerns that doing so would discourage officials from raising concerns about abuses of power by government officials in the future\u2014have gained steam among Republican officials as the impeachment inquiry has continued. Kentucky Senator Rand Paul called on the media to reveal the whistleblower's identity at a campaign rally in November. Donald Trump Jr. also identified another individual as the whistleblower on Twitter earlier in November, a decision he defended during a recent appearance on The View.\nCiting the damage the drive to out the whistleblower could cause, former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper called the so-called exposures a \"breach of faith and trust\" that \"will have a chilling effect, clearly, on others who observe wrongdoing.\""

        "text": "They looked the part.\nIf President Trump were to cast the characters for career U.S. diplomats specializing in Eastern Europe, William B. Taylor Jr. and George Kent would have made the cut.\nTaylor, the acting ambassador to Ukraine, and Kent, a deputy assistant secretary at the State Department, delivered the sort of analytical and sedate testimony that comes with decades stationed abroad in locations that only make it onto the domestic news if something has gone horribly wrong.\nDuring more than 5 1/2 hours of testimony before the House Intelligence Committee, Democrats found two witnesses who came across as experts in their field, looking and sounding as if they knew far more about the subject matter than any member of the committee on either side of the dais.\nKent sported a bow tie, with a three-piece suit, while Taylor wore a traditional dark power suit that was amplified with a booming voice that some TV viewers likened to America's most famous 20th-century newsman, the late Walter Cronkite.\nThey aren't household names and lacked the blockbuster revelations \u2014 there was no disclosure of secret White House tapes, like there was during the Watergate hearings in 1973 \u2014 but Taylor and Kent brought to life the story that Democrats have been telling only in bits and pieces.\nEven Trump's staunchest allies vouched for their character when the testimony concluded.\n\"They're credible public servants,\" Rep. Mark Meadows (R-N.C.), who watched the hearing in a seat behind the media, told reporters afterward.\nHe quickly suggested they lacked credibility because they never spoke directly to Trump or to other senior White House officials, dismissing their story as hearsay evidence as most GOP members of the committee had done. Meadows even belittled their testimony as a bit boring.\n\"More people were yawning than applauding,\" Meadows said.\nBut Democrats saw these witnesses, the first public testimony in what will be a few weeks of open hearings, as laying the foundation to impeach Trump over his intervention into Ukrainian affairs. Taylor and Kent testified that Trump pressuring Ukrainian officials to launch investigations into Democratic rivals violated their understanding of diplomatic norms and that his personal intervention in delaying nearly $400 million in security aid violated several decades of bipartisan foreign policy.\nThat their testimony came across a bit dry at times reinforced what House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) called \"a prayerful day for all of us\" in a closed-door Democratic caucus meeting before Wednesday's hearing started, according to the notes of a Democrat in the room. The person spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss a private meeting.\n\"You exemplify so many courageous men and women who serve in the diplomatic corps, who've served in our military, who represent the United States so well around the world,\" Rep. Adam B. Schiff (D-Calif.), chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, said as the hearing wrapped up.\nFrom their opening statements, the diplomats tried to set the tone by each outlining their long tenures in public service and their family's history in the military, giving them an extra amount of heft before a 22-memeber committee in which only three lawmakers served in the military and another in the CIA before coming to Congress.\nFive of Kent's great uncles served in the Navy and Army during World War II, including one who survived the Bataan Death March only to end up spending three years in Japanese prisoner of war camps.\n\"Indeed, there has been a George Kent sworn to defend the Constitution continuously for nearly 60 years, ever since my father reported to Annapolis for his plebe summer,\" Kent said.\nTaylor outlined more than 50 years of service, starting as a cadet at the U.S. Military Academy and then as an infantry officer with the 101st Airborne Division in Vietnam. He worked at the Department of Energy, on the Senate staff, and at NATO, before joining the State Department for stints that included a previous tenure as ambassador to Ukraine.\n\"I am nonpartisan and have been appointed to my positions by every president from President Reagan to President Trump,\" Taylor said in opening his testimony.\nTaylor brought with him one piece of new information, revealing that one of his aides in Kyiv just told him about a phone conversation July 26 between Trump and the ambassador to the European Union, Gordon Sondland.\nThat came the day after Trump's now-famous call with Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky in which, according to a partial transcript released by the White House, the president asked Zelensky to \"do us a favor\" to conduct investigations into his political rivals.\nOn that call, Taylor's aide could hear the president's voice, and afterward the aide inquired about Trump's views of Ukraine.\n\"President Trump cares more about the investigations,\" Sondland replied, according to Taylor's testimony Wednesday.\nRepublicans weigh whether a focus on process or facts is best way to aid Trump in impeachment hearings\nRepublicans tried at times to knock the diplomats off their position or at least to demean their testimony as third-hand whispers about what the president might have thought. Rep. Jim Jordan (R-Ohio), newly installed to the panel for his bulldog style, lived up to that reputation with a rapid-fire style of questions that few people in attendance could follow, let alone the witnesses.\n"

        "text": "Could the legal situation possibly get any worse for Lev Parnas, the associate of President Donald Trump's personal attorney Rudy Giuliani who's under criminal indictment in a campaign finance case?\nShort answer: Yes.\nA frustrated creditor is trying to seize bail funds that Parnas \u2014 a potential witness in the ongoing impeachment proceedings against Trump \u2014 posted to stay out of jail while awaiting trial.\nAnd a federal judge might authorize the seizure.\nThe development stems from the latest efforts of a family trust that since 2015 has tried to collect on a more than $500,000 judgment against Parnas from a movie-loan deal gone bad. The total has since risen to more than $678,000.\nIn a rare but not unprecedented action, the trust filed an Oct. 29 writ to garnish $200,000 that Parnas's family posted to secure his $1 million appearance bond in the criminal case. The bond keyed a judge's decision to order Parnas held under home detention, rather than jail, pending trial.\nA federal attorney in Virginia, where the bond was initially posted, objected and filed a proposed motion to vacate the writ because a judge ordered the bail package to ensure Parnas shows up for court hearings and trial.\nA federal court in Florida, where Parnas and his family reside, took the proposed motion \"under advisement,\" but did not reject it. Instead, U.S. District Court Judge Donald Middlebrooks ordered attorneys for the family Trust and Parnas to file legal arguments about the unusual collection effort.\nThe collection attempt has taken on heightened public significance because the Ukraine-born Parnas and an associate, Belarus-born Igor Fruman, helped Giuliani seek damaging information in Ukraine about the family of former Vice President Joe Biden \u2014 a potential Trump challenger in the 2020 presidential election.\nThey also reportedly assisted Giuliani in seeking the ouster of then-U.S. ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch. Trump recalled her to Washington, D.C., in May. As a result, House impeachment investigators have subpoenaed both men.\nThe proceedings \u2014 with the first live public testimony scheduled for Wednesday \u2014 focus on allegations that Trump delayed roughly $400 million in congressionally-approved U.S. aid to Ukraine. The goal, in theory, was to pressure Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky for an investigation of Biden's son's financial involvement in a Ukrainian gas company called Burisma Holdings.\nTrump also sought an investigation of an unproven theory that Ukraine, not Russia, interfered with the 2016 U.S. presidential election that brought him to the White House. He has repeatedly denied there was anything improper about the aid delay or his investigation requests.\n Parnas and Fruman initially refused to cooperate with the impeachment proceedings. However, defense lawyer Joseph Bondy recently signaled Parnas might provide evidence so long as he did not risk to endanger his defense in the criminal case, The New York Times reported.\nThe day's top stories, from sports to movies to politics to world events.\nIn that case, federal prosecutors in New York allege that Parnas and Fruman conspired in a scheme to win influence by funneling hundreds of thousands of dollars in foreign funds to U.S. politicians and election committees. According to the indictment unsealed in October, the scheme involved an unnamed Ukrainian government official and an unidentified Russian businessman who bankrolled the effort.\nThe long-running judgment collection effort stems from $300,000 that the Michael Pues, the trustee for the Pues Family Trust IRA, loaned Parnas in 2010 to invest in a movie that was to be called \"Anatomy of an Assassin.\" However, the film was never produced, and Parnas didn't return the money.\nThe trust won a judgment against Parnas and his company, Parnas holdings, in a 2015 federal court decision in the Eastern District of New York. After filing the judgment in Florida, the trust embarked on the so-far fruitless effort to collect from a man whom court filings show has been the target of a string of evictions and civil lawsuits, including one in which his attorneys sued him for non-payment.\nIn a court filing on Tuesday evening, defense attorney Chris Draper argued that Parnas's bail funds could not be garnished because the money was posted by his wife, Svetlana Parnas. The funds are \"essentially being held in trust by the court to be delivered back to whom they belong, and thus are not funds or assets\" of Parnas, Draper argued.\nTony Andre, an attorney representing the Pues Family Trust IRA, disagreed in a filing that cited court cases involving creditors that garnished bail packages to recover unpaid debts.\nThe collection effort \"is a somewhat extraordinary remedy\" the trust \"has been forced to resort to, because of\" Parnas's \"actions to conceal his assets,\" argued Andre. \"Here, the court has the broad power and responsibility to attach assets . . . to satisfy this long-standing judgment.\nJudge Middlebrooks is expected to review the legal arguments before issuing a decision. However, even before the Florida court acted, U.S. District Judge Paul Oetken, who is presiding over the criminal case against Parnas, ordered the court clerk not to release the bail funds."

        "text": "Rhode Island's municipal leaders on Tuesday filed a legal challenge in Superior Court to the new \"financially irresponsible lifetime contracts law'' that Gov. Gina Raimondo signed at the behest of the state's public employee unions last spring.\nIn their lawsuit, the mayors and town managers contend the new law extending union contracts indefinitely after they have expired violates both the contracts clause and Home Rule provision of the state Constitution, which grants cities and towns the authority to decide local matters.\n\"In other words, a municipality would be forced to honor all previous contract terms for possibly a year or longer, spend taxpayer dollars on legal fees for mediation and arbitration, and still lack leverage at the end of the process to gain concessions on wages and benefits,'' they argued in the suit that former Providence Mayor Angel Taveras, a lawyer, filed on their behalf against House Speaker Nicholas Mattiello, Senate President Dominick Ruggerio and Raimondo.\nOne after another, the mayors and town managers standing side by side at a news conference at North Providence Town Hall said the new law also creates an \"imaginary finish line to all of our labor contracts'' that removes any incentive for unions to negotiate concessions.\n\"As the costs of health care, pensions and retiree benefits keep rising, taxpayers will get crushed if local leaders can't renegotiate those benefits,'' Cranston Mayor Allan Fung said. \n\"Wages and benefits represent 70% of city and school budgets and most of [the] associated costs, whether it's health care, pensions ... continue to rise at alarming rates and the grandparents on fixed incomes and widows just barely scraping by cannot take the tax collectors coming back for more,'' Fung said.\n\"We're here to tell you ... enough is enough,'' he said.\n\"All we are asking for is to be at the dining room table, in the dining room, and not out in the back yard in the shed,'' added North Providence Mayor Charles Lombardi.\nIn a joint statement, Mattiello and Ruggerio said: \"We're disappointed that some local leaders have chosen to take the unusual step of suing the General Assembly and the Governor. We are confident the law enacted to protect our municipal employees and teachers will withstand this legal challenge.\"\n\"This law requires all municipal leaders to come to the negotiating table in good faith. It protects wages and benefits when a contract has expired so that these employees can continue to serve their communities and our children. This law, which had been standard practice for many years, is fair to both sides and creates a level playing field for all parties,'' they said.\nRaimondo's office said she had not had a chance to review the newly filed lawsuit, but she believes \"the legislation passed by the General Assembly last session was narrowly tailored to return to what was the status quo for decades in Rhode Island'' \u2014 before a 2009 court decision in an East Providence case \u2014 \"and we're confident it will stand.\"\nBut Brian Daniels, executive director of the Rhode Island League of Cites and Towns, pushed back, saying: \"The status quo was that mayors and town managers negotiated their own local contracts \u2014 not the state.\"\nThe communities filing the suit include Barrington, Bristol, Burrillville, Central Falls, Charlestown, Cranston, East Greenwich, Lincoln, Little Compton, North Kingstown, North Providence, North Smithfield, Pawtucket, Providence, Smithfield and Woonsocket.\nJohnston Mayor Joseph Polisena told WPRO he did not sign on because the other cities and towns did not back his town's legal fight for street light reimbursements.\nWarwick Mayor Joseph Solomon told The Journal: \"At this time, I don't believe that litigation is the answer. ... I believe we can get more accomplished by having open discussions about potential amendments ... [such as] an amendment that provides some alternative means for the contract to expire after a reasonable period of time that is fair and balanced to both the employees and the taxpayers.\"\nThe unions that pushed for more than a decade for the continuing-contracts law said it was aimed at preventing cities and towns from ever again unilaterally cutting pay, increasing health-care contributions and imposing what they view as disruptive work shifts on public employees, as happened in a handful of communities during past contract disputes.\nSenate co-sponsor Valarie Lawson, the paid vice president of the National Education Association of Rhode Island, told colleagues last spring: \"We can make sure no other community in Rhode Island faces what we faced in East Providence,'' including a unilateral salary cut and a stepped up co-share for health coverage during a bitter contract war a decade ago. (The state Ethics Commission subsequently ruled she had no conflict of interest.)  \nIn 2017, Raimondo vetoed an earlier version of the bill, saying: \"Current Rhode Island law protects the taxpayers from being obligated indefinitely for contract provisions that, in the future, may not be affordable.\n\"The proposed legislation before me extinguishes this existing protection, hurting the public's position in contract negotiations, and placing taxpayers at risk of being forever locked into contractual provisions they can no longer afford,'' she said then. \"The likely result would be higher property taxes.\"\nIn a statement explaining her turnaround last spring, Raimondo said the earlier continuing-contracts bill \"went too far in automatically extending all provisions in collective bargaining agreements for municipal employees and teachers until a successor agreement has been reached.\"\nThe version she opted to sign only locks in wages and benefits, she said.\nRaimondo's shift came after she won the endorsement of the National Education Association of Rhode Island and other unions in her 2018 reelection bid. \n"

        "title": "Bloomberg to pass on Iowa, NH, focus on Super Tuesday states",
        "text": "Michael Bloomberg plans to skip early voting states like Iowa and New Hampshire if he launches a presidential bid and instead focus his efforts on the crush of states that vote on Super Tuesday and beyond. It's a strategy that acknowledges the limitations of entering the race at this late stage and the opportunities afforded by the billionaire's vast personal wealth.\nBloomberg adviser Howard Wolfson says other candidates already have a big head start in the first four states to vote \u2014 Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada and South Carolina \u2014 and Bloomberg needs to be realistic about where he can make up ground.\n\"If we run, we are confident we can win in states voting on Super Tuesday and beyond, where we will start on an even footing,\" Wolfson said. Nearly a quarter of primary delegates up for grabs in the March 3 Super Tuesday contests.\nBloomberg qualified Friday to get on the ballot in Alabama, one of the Super Tuesday states. His team is also making plans to file in Arkansas, which has a Tuesday deadline.\nBloomberg's candidacy has the potential to upend the Democratic race less than three months before primary voting begins. The billionaire businessman initially ruled out a 2020 run, but began to reconsider in recent weeks, citing concerns about the ability of the current crop of contenders to defeat President Donald Trump.\nBloomberg himself has called prominent Democrats to alert them to his likely run, and his staff is scrambling to meet fast-approaching primary filing deadlines.\nAmong those Bloomberg has reached out to: Tom Vilsack, the former Iowa governor who remains popular in the state. Vilsack told The Associated Press that Bloomberg called him Thursday evening and left a voicemail indicating he plans to run.\n\"He is in,\" Vilsack said of Bloomberg's message.\nDespite the outreach to Vilsack, advisers say Bloomberg would not make a serious play for votes in Iowa and the other early states. Other candidates in the crowded field have spent months courting voters there and building campaign operations.\nThe early states offer just a small percentage of the delegates needed to clinch the Democratic nomination. But victories there typically give candidates crucial momentum that helps carry them into bigger states with more delegates on the line.\nBloomberg is calculating that he could build an advantage in those states now with his ability to quickly pour money into staff, television advertising and other campaign operations while other candidates are competing elsewhere.\nBill Carrick, a veteran Democratic strategist based in Los Angeles, said he doesn't think skipping the early voting states is ever a viable strategy.\n\"I don't think you can just hopscotch around the calendar to suit your own political purposes,\" Carrick said. \"You skip the early states, you're going to have a difficult time. I don't see any evidence that strategy ever works.\"\nOfficials in Iowa and New Hampshire said they were disappointed in Bloomberg's decision. New Hampshire Democratic Party Chair Ray Buckley said it was unfortunate that Bloomberg won't \"be tested the same way that the other Democratic candidates have been and will be.\"\nBloomberg has spent the past few weeks talking with prominent Democrats about the state of the race, expressing concerns about the steadiness of former Vice President Joe Biden's campaign and the rise of liberal Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, according to people with knowledge of those discussions who spoke on condition of anonymity to relay details of private conversations.\nBiden, campaigning in New Hampshire on Friday, welcomed Bloomberg to the race.\n\"Michael's a solid guy, and let's see where it goes,\" he told reporters. \"I have no problem with him getting in the race.\"\nBloomberg's moves come as the Democratic race enters a crucial phase. Biden's front-runner status has been vigorously challenged by Warren and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, who are flush with cash from small-dollar donors. But both are viewed by some Democrats as too liberal to win in a general election faceoff with Trump.\nTrump told reporters Friday that Bloomberg might well spend \"a lot of money\" but \"doesn't have the magic to do well.\" Trump suggested he'd easily beat the former mayor and fellow billionaire.\n\"Little Michael will fail,\" Trump said at the White House, adding, \"There is nobody I'd rather run against than Little Michael, that I can tell you.\"\nDespite a historically large field, some Democrats anxious about defeating Trump have been looking for other options. Former Attorney General Eric Holder and former Massachusetts Gov. Deval Patrick have quietly had conversations with supporters urging them to consider a run, but neither appears likely to get in the race.\nBloomberg, a Republican-turned-independent who registered as a Democrat last year, has flirted with a presidential run before but ultimately backed down, including in 2016. He endorsed Hillary Clinton in that race and, in a speech at the Democratic Party convention, pummeled Trump as a con who has oversold his business successes.\nBloomberg instead plunged his efforts and his money into gun control advocacy and climate change initiatives. He again looked seriously at a presidential bid earlier this year, traveling to early voting states and conducting extensive polling, but decided not to run in part because of Biden's perceived strength.\n"

        "text": "A career State Department employee was forced out of her job on baseless accusations that she opposed President Trump, was loyal to the Obama administration and was guilty of compromised objectivity due to her Iranian ethnicity, according to an inspector general report released Thursday.\n\nOf the several cases reviewed by the Office of the Inspector General (OIG) in its report, released Thursday, it was the only one in which the office determined that political and presidential appointees at the State Department retaliated against a career service employee based on political motivations and other \"improper personnel practices.\"{mosads}\n\nOf four other cases the OIG investigated, there was inconclusive evidence for two instances, with the office saying it was unable to \"obtain essential information from key decision makers.\"\n\nTwo other cases were cleared, with the OIG finding no evidence of wrongdoing.\n\nAccusations of politically motivated attacks on State Department officials are at the center of an impeachment inquiry into President Trump and whether he was guided by personal political motivations to oust a career foreign service officer from her post, former U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovich.\n\nThe inspector general's report, however, focuses on cases that date back to the time under the tenure of former Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, who was fired by the president in March 2018.\n\nThe report describes the termination of career State employee Sahar Nowrouzzadeh, who is currently a research fellow on Iran at Harvard University. According to the report, Nowrouzzadeh was working in the office of policy planning, a kind of internal think tank for the department, but was eventually reassigned from her work based on accusations stemming from conservative news articles.\n\nThese accusations were reenforced by other department employees who referred to career staffers as \"Obama/Clinton loyalists\" and \"not supportive\" of \"Trump's agenda.\"\n\nThe OIG also documented that staff stated the employee was \"born in Iran\" and that this created a conflict of interest for work in policy planning.\n\nThe watchdog concluded in its report that Nowrouzzadeh's \"perceived political opinions, perceived association with former administrations, and her perceived national origin played at least some role in the expressed opinions that\" the employee should not remain in the assigned office.\n\nThe investigation was originally initiated by department employee complaints and congressional committees concerned that political and presidential appointees at the department were forcing out career staffers on baseless accusations of disloyalty to the president and his administration.\n\nThe inspector general recommended the secretary of State take disciplinary action against department employees who have disciplined employees on perceived political affiliations and not based solely on merit.\n\nNo State employees were singled out as necessitating disciplinary action, although seven were identified as playing roles in the offensive behavior against career employees.\n\nThese include Brian Hook, the State Department's special representative on Iran who at the time was the director of policy planning and responsible for terminating the career employee in that office.\n\nThe OIG report did not determine that Hook acted out of political motivation, saying it found no hard evidence to suggest he was personally motivated to end Nowrouzzadeh's employment early.\n\nYet the report did raise questions of inconsistencies in his defense of his firing of the career staffer.\n\nThis included that Hook said he fired the career staffer to open up a position for J. Matthew McInnis to handle the Iran portfolio. Yet OIG, following up with McInnis, found that he and Hook only met for the first time months after the career staffer was terminated and only at the initiation of McInnis.\n\n\"OIG concluded this was not a convincing explanation\" on the part of Hook for his reason to terminate the career employee, the report stated. \n\nThe State Department counselor, T. Ulrich Brechbuhl, responded to the OIG report saying that it \"disagrees\" with the finding that \"improper considerations\" led to Nowrouzzadeh's termination and supported the Hook's decision to let her go, saying it was based on \"entirely professional and lawful reasons.\"\n\nHook also challenged the OIG's timeline of events and said that his decision to terminate Nowrouzzadeh came before any of the \"non-merit\" accusations and at a time when he was already considering bringing in new Iran experts.\n\nThe OIG also recommended a training program for political and presidential appointees on prohibited practices of dealing with career staffers and a review of the department's related policies. \n\nNowrouzzadeh responded to the OIG's report on Twitter, saying that she hopes the report \"guards against any future misconduct by members of this or any future administration.\"\n\n\"For nearly 15 years, I've been proud to serve our country, across Republican and Democratic administrations,\" she wrote on Twitter. \"I continue to strongly encourage Americans of all backgrounds, including those of Iranian heritage, to consider public service to our nation and to not be discouraged by these findings.\""

        "text": "\u2022\tOn January 21, the Senate will kick off its trial on two articles of impeachment against President Donald Trump \u2014 abuse of his office and obstruction of Congress.\n\u2022\tThe US Senate holds a trial to acquit or convict Trump. Two-thirds of the Senate would have to vote to convict Trump in order to remove him from office. \n\u2022\tArticle I, Section 3 of the United States constitution says \"judgment in cases of impeachment shall not extend further than to removal from office, and disqualification to hold and enjoy any office of honor.\"\n\u2022\tAfter convicting a federal officer, the Senate must separately vote by simple majority to prevent them from holding a federal office in the future, meaning Trump could still theoretically win re-election.\n\u2022\tThe scenario is highly implausible given the steadfast support of Trump's base and a Republican-controlled Senate, but it shows how Trump has a route to redemption through the electoral process. \n\u2022\tVisit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.\nOn January 21, the Senate will kick off its trial on two articles of impeachment against President Donald Trump \u2014 abuse of his office and obstruction of Congress.\nIn December, the House of Representatives held a vote on two articles of impeachment against President Donald Trump for abusing his office and obstructing Congress, setting the stage for an impeachment trial next month. \nThe House passed the abuse of power article by a vote of 230 to 197 to 1 and the obstruction of Congress article by a vote of 229 to 198 to 1. \nSome conservative pundits have compared the impeachment inquiry to a coup, and have characterized Trump's potential impeachment as the \"ultimate penalty,\" or final punishment as conservative commentator Brit Hume did in a November tweet. \nBut even if Trump were removed from his office by Congress, he could still redeem himself in the court of public opinion and through the electoral process. \nThe constitutional mechanism for the impeachment of a federal officer including presidents, vice presidents, and federal judges is laid out in Article II, Section 4 of the US constitution, which reads, \"the President, Vice President and all civil Officers of the United States, shall be removed from office on impeachment for, and conviction of, treason, bribery, or other high crimes and misdemeanors.\"\nNow that the House has impeached Trump and appointed impeachment managers to argue the case, they go to the US Senate, which holds a trial on the charges overseen by the Chief Justice of the US Supreme Court. A two-thirds majority of the US Senate, or 67 senators if all 100 are present, must vote to convict in order to remove him from office. \nCongress has never removed a president with the impeachment process before in American history. While two previous US presidents \u2014 Andrew Johnson and Bill Clinton \u2014 were impeached by the House, both were acquitted in the Senate. \nWhile the constitution lays out a mechanism to remove a president from office, it doesn't prevent a president or other \"civil officer\" removed from their office by the impeachment process from running for office or being elected to federal office again. \nArticle I, Section 3 of the United States constitution explicitly says that in terms of political consequences, \"judgment in cases of impeachment shall not extend further than to removal from office, and disqualification to hold and enjoy any office of honor, trust or profit under the United States.\" (Officers who are impeached can still be indicted and prosecuted in a court of law).\nBut according to a 2015 Congressional Research Service report, being convicted and removed from office doesn't automatically lead to the \"disqualification to hold and enjoy any office of honor.\" After convicting a federal officer, the Senate must separately vote by simple majority to prevent them from holding a federal office in the future. \nRep. Alcee Hastings of Florida, for example, was impeached and removed from his position as a federal judge by Congress, but later elected to the US House of Representatives because the US Senate did not vote to disqualify him from holding future office after convicting him. \nTo be sure, this scenario is highly unlikely.\nIt's very unlikely for Trump to be convicted by the GOP-controlled Senate, which is currently made up of 53 Republicans, 45 Democrats, and two independents that caucus with Democrats.  \nTrump currently benefits from a big \"red wall\" of 36 GOP senators from states where Trump's approval rating swings more favorably, as Axios has reported. Fifteen of those senators are up for reelection in 2020, and an additional 10 senators represent states where Trump's approval rating is underwater but are not up for reelection next year.\nThere are just five vulnerable GOP senators up for re-election next year in states where Trump's approval rating, as tracked by Morning Consult polling, is underwater. \nAs Insider previously reported, Trump's sky-high approval and favorability among the Republican Party and his takeover of the entire GOP apparatus means there is very little incentive for any Republican senators, including the vulnerable ones, to break with Trump knowing none of their colleagues have any reason to do so. \nAccording to FiveThirtyEight's weighted tracker of impeachment polling, Republicans have expressed consistent opposition to impeachment since March of this year even as this fall's impeachment inquiry unfolded, with just 9.7% of Republicans currently supporting Trump's impeachment.\nThe latest 2019 American Values Survey, conducted August 22 to September 15 by the Public Religion Research Institute, further found that forty-five percent of Republicans without a college degree and fifty-five percent of GOP respondents who named Fox as their primary news source \u2014 two demographics Trump relies on\u2014 say there was absolutely nothing Trump could do to lose their support. \nIf Trump's base significantly abandoned him to the point where 20 GOP senators felt comfortable voting to remove him, it's also unlikely that the American electorate would then vote to re-elect him.\nTrump's re-election would also be contingent on Vice President Mike Pence \u2014 who would become president if Trump were removed from office \u2014 stepping aside and not running for the Republican presidential nomination. Still, Trump has a theoretical route to be sworn in as president again in 2021 even if the Senate does remove him from office. \n"

        "text": "From her second-story walk-up office in Kyiv's old Perchersk neighborhood, Daria Kaleniuk has been fighting the fire-breathing dragons of Ukrainian corruption \u2014 oligarchs and politicians and judges on the take.\nLittle did she know she would also be going up against the most powerful man on Earth, Donald Trump.\nKaleniuk is one of a new generation of Ukrainians who grew up in a freshly independent former Soviet republic that struggled to break free of Russia and to build institutions of basic governance. These young reformers speak English, aspire to Western values, reject their country's Soviet past, have turned away from Moscow \u2014 and now fear that the U.S. has turned away from them.\nTheir work to battle graft and demand change belies the Ukraine that President Trump portrays.\nAccording to testimony before the House impeachment inquiry by Kurt Volker, the former U.S. special representative to Ukraine, Trump once said of Ukrainians, \"They are all corrupt, they are all terrible people.\" Trump has also suggested, despite voluminous evidence to the contrary, that Ukraine, not Russia, interfered in the 2016 U.S. presidential election.\nThere's no question that Ukraine has a serious corruption problem. Transparency International, which ranks countries according to their level of perceived corruption, lists Ukraine as 130th out of 180 nations, with No. 1 being the cleanest. That makes it among the most corrupt countries in Europe, barely ahead of Russia.\nYet activists, academics and politicians here insist the real Ukraine is making significant progress in fighting corruption. And these Ukrainians are angry that Trump has dragged them into U.S. politics by asking their new president, Volodymyr Zelensky, to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden and his son Hunter.\n\"We are desperately trying to change the country ... from a very corrupt kleptocracy to a democracy,\" Kaleniuk said on a recent chilly, gray morning in her office. \"This is Ukraine's moment, the moment to help. And instead, we got a knife in the back.\"\nAs part of the movement undertaken by a robust post-communist civil society, and often working with U.S. development grants, Kaleniuk's Anti-Corruption Action Center and other grass-roots organizations have helped create a new anti-corruption court in Kyiv, replace several dishonest prosecutors and expose illicit campaign contributions, money-laundering schemes and political backroom deals.\nThey were instrumental in the Maidan revolution of 2014, a popular revolt that led to the ouster of an unpopular, pro-Russia president and ushered in Western-leaning governments, including that of Zelensky, a TV comedian who won a landslide victory this year.\nSupporters call them nothing short of fearless.\n\"The fight isn't over yet,\" said Sviatoslav Yurash, a newly elected member of parliament in Zelensky's Servant of the People party. \"Our goal is to see a completely different country in five years.\" At 23, Yurash is the youngest member of parliament in Ukraine's history and another participant in the reform movement.\nFormer U.S. Ambassador Marie Yovanovitch, whom Trump attorney Rudolph W. Giuliani campaigned successfully to have recalled from Kyiv in May, was an enthusiastic supporter of the reformers, as is her replacement, William B. Taylor Jr. , fulfilling his second stint as America's senior diplomat in the country.\n\"This new government has appealed to young people who are so idealistic, pro-West, pro-United States, pro-Europe, that I feel an emotional attachment, bond, connection to this country and these people,\" Taylor testified before the congressional panel investigating Trump.\nThe turning point for the generational shift was the Maidan revolution that forced out President Viktor Yanukovich who, along with his business associates, robbed the country of around $100 billion. He fled to Russia, confronted by the massive demonstrations in which more than 100 protesters died.\nWeeks later, the Kremlin seized Ukraine's Crimean peninsula and backed separatist militias in Ukraine's east, where fighting continues.\n\"Maidan was about fighting corruption and an authoritarian government,\" said Yulia Marushevska, 30, another of the new generation of anti-corruption crusaders in Kyiv. \"How can a country that lost a hundred people on Maidan in the fight against corruption and authoritarianism be called the most corrupt country in the world?\"\nThe Maidan revolt set into motion an anti-corruption movement led in part by young activists such as Kaleniuk and Marushevska. Their work led Ukraine to overhaul the police system in an attempt to eliminate bribe-taking. It established a transparent, online system for public procurement. It created the National Anti-Corruption Bureau of Ukraine to investigate graft.\nWhen a new, pro-Western government was elected in March 2014, Marushevska was appointed to the Odessa regional government and eventually put in charge of reforms in the Black Sea city's notoriously corrupt ports and customs office.\nThe Maidan street revolution had another, perhaps more important outcome for Ukrainians, Marushevska said.\n\"Empowerment,\" she said. \"People now understood that we have the power to change the country.\"\nIn May, long before the scandal broke in the U.S., Kaleniuk's organization and 19 other Ukrainian groups petitioned the U.S. Treasury Department to blacklist former Ukrainian Atty. Gen. Yuri Lutsenko, the man who initially worked with Giuliani to smear the former U.S. ambassador, Yovanovitch, and spread unsupported stories about Joe Biden's dealings with Ukraine. Treasury took no action.\nLutsenko, in a September interview with The Times, recanted the claims he made, but they had already reached, and convinced, Trump.\nAll of the work earned Kaleniuk and her organization the enmity of Ukraine's most powerful people: billionaire tycoons backed with armies of lawyers and highly paid American crisis management public relations firms. This was no surprise, she said.\nBut then Giuliani added his voice.\nIn public appearances, Giuliani painted the anti-corruption group as a dubious tool of George Soros, the Hungarian-born philanthropist who founded the Open Society Foundations. Like many pro-democracy groups across Europe, Kaleniuk's organization receives funding from Open Society, last year to the tune of about $150,000, or about a quarter of the Ukrainian group's budget. But branding people or groups as having ties to Soros has become a trope, often tinged with anti-Semitism, used by the American right wing, which considers Soros a leftist partisan.\nSlightly more than half of the money the Anti-Corruption Action Center has received since 2012 comes from the U.S. government.\nIn some cases, attacks have been even more direct. The group's founder, Vitaly Shabunin, 34, whose investigations exposed Yanukovych's gross abuse of power and illicit resources, was doused with a green substance while he and dozens of other activists were demonstrating in a Kyiv square last year. The substance, a harsh chemical commonly used as an antiseptic here, left burns on his face and eyes.\nThe broadsides from the Trump administration have made the anti-corruption crusade that much more difficult, Kaleniuk said, and given sustenance to the recalcitrant, old-school oligarchs \"who try to protect themselves through all possible means.\" And that, she said, ultimately helps Russian President Vladimir Putin, who benefits from a weak Ukraine.\n\"It is in the interest of Russia to portray us as a ... hopelessly corrupt country ... [and] a constant place of instability,\" ineligible to join Western institutions such as the North Atlantic Treaty Organization or the European Union, Kaleniuk said. \"This is about more than corruption and Ukraine. It's about an autocratic regime fighting the liberal democratic world.\"\nPutin seized Ukraine's Crimean peninsula in 2014 and continues to occupy it. Russia-backed separatists are fighting a deadly war in eastern Ukraine's Donbas region.\nUkrainians have noted that Trump often seems to be using Putin's talking points when discussing Ukraine, telling filmmaker Oliver Stone in June that \"Russians and Ukrainians are actually one people\" and dismissing Moscow's aggression. By contrast, many foreign policy experts and geopolitical strategists argue that Ukraine is the key bulwark against an expansionist Russia, caught as it is in a tug-of-war between East and West.\n\"The future of Ukraine is the future of Europe,\" said Daniel Hamilton, a former diplomat who specializes in Europe at the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies in Washington.\nAs the young reformers confront that challenge, they also worry now, amid the Trump impeachment inquiry, that they are also losing the traditional bipartisan U.S. congressional support they have enjoyed for years in executing reforms and building democracy.\nAlyona Getmanchuk, director of the New Europe Center, a progressive think tank in Kyiv, is a foreign policy expert and ardent supporter of the new generation of reformers. Trump's antagonism toward the country and its endeavors is clearer than ever, she said. Trump has made Ukraine a \"political football,\" a position the country does not want. And she fears that the topic of Ukraine has become \"toxic\" in the halls of Congress.\n\"All the major reforms [were] launched with major U.S. support and involvement along every step of the way,\" she said. \"That is why it would be harder to push for them without the U.S. It would not stop the process, but it would slow it down. And we can't risk that.\""

        "text": "It seemed like the moment Paul Jamushian had been waiting for his whole life.\nOn Oct. 29, the U.S. House of Representatives voted 405 to 11 in favor of a resolution to recognize the killing of 1.5 million Armenians more than a century ago as a genocide. Quick approval by the Senate appeared possible.\nBut the 80-year-old Jamushian, whose parents survived the slaughter by Ottoman Turks, will have to keep waiting.\nPolitics had once again intervened \u2014 this time the incursion by Turkey into northeastern Syria last month and a White House visit Wednesday by Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.\n\"I feel like I got played,\" said Jamushian, who lives in Fresno. \"It makes me angry.\"\nSen. Robert Menendez (D-N.J.), who has coauthored resolutions to recognize the Armenian genocide since 2006, requested the unanimous consent of the Senate on Wednesday to pass the latest attempt.\n\"The United States Congress cannot stand idly by and let the truth of genocide be silenced,\" he told fellow senators. \"We must commit ourselves to learning the painful history of the Armenians as we seek to build a better world for our own and future generations.\"\nThat's when Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), who had joined Erdogan's meeting with President Trump, objected and blocked the request, arguing that senators shouldn't \"sugarcoat history or try to rewrite it.\"\n\"I do hope that Turkey and Armenia can come together and deal with this problem,\" he said.\nTurkish authorities refuse to call the massacre a genocide because they claim that the killings were not systematic and that people of all religious and ethnic backgrounds, including Turkish Muslims, died during World War I.\nThe new development did not kill the resolution, but it will stretch out the process by which the Senate considers it.\nThe latest effort in the House grew out of widespread bipartisan anger with Turkey over its recent actions in Syria, including the killing of Kurds who helped the United States take back large swaths of territory from Islamic State militants.\n\"Given that the Turks are once again involved in ethnic cleansing the population \u2014 this time the Kurds who live along the Turkish-Syrian border \u2014 it seemed all the more appropriate to bring up a resolution about the Ottoman efforts to annihilate an entire people in the Armenian genocide,\" Rep. Adam B. Schiff (D-Burbank) said recently.\nWhen the House passed the resolution last month, it was the first time in more than three decades that Congress had labeled the slaughter genocide.\nIn 1975 and again in 1984 the House passed resolutions that referenced the killing of Armenians as genocide and set aside April 24 as a day of remembrance for victims of all genocides. And in 1981, President Reagan issued a proclamation about the Holocaust in Nazi Germany and in it also mentioned the genocide of the Armenians.\nBut in the decades that followed, efforts in Congress to pass a resolution that singularly recognizes the Armenian killings as genocide has failed. Presidents Clinton and George W. Bush argued that such measures could hamper U.S. interests in the region. Both President Obama and Trump have stopped short of calling the slaughter a genocide.\nLegislation on the topic has been introduced each year. The furthest the Senate has gone was in 2014 when its Foreign Relations Committee passed a resolution that failed to win wider approval.\nAram Hamparian, executive director of the Washington-based Armenian National Committee of America, said he remains confident that the Senate will pass the resolution.\n\"We can't predict where Trump's views will be on Turkey in one week or one month,\" he said.\n\"We feel we would get overwhelming support of the Senate, but we need it to come to the floor so members can vote on it,\" he said. \"My message to Graham is that if you have a problem with the resolution, then allow it to come to the floor and then vote no, but don't block other members of the Senate.\"\nDonald E. Miller, author of \"Survivors: An Oral History of the Armenian Genocide,\" said he isn't surprised Graham blocked the resolution.\n\"Turkey has spent millions lobbying against recognition of the genocide,\" he said in an email. \"The American Congress and multiple presidents capitulate to this pressure because of Turkey's strategic location and the presence of U.S. military bases on Turkish soil. Historical fact has little to do with political pressures \u2014 and money.\"\nInitially, the Armenian community thrived under Ottoman rule. But toward the end of the 19th century, as the Ottoman Empire began to collapse and World War I began, its rulers came to view Armenians as traitors.\nOttoman Turks started killing and expelling Armenians in what is now Turkey starting in 1915. By the early 1920s, more than a million Armenians were dead and many more displaced.\nToday, scholars and historians widely agree that what happened to Armenians was a systematic killing and should be recognized as a genocide. More than 40 states \u2014 including California \u2014 and 20 countries have recognized the deaths as genocide, as has the Los Angeles Times and many other newspapers.\nSouthern California is home to the largest Armenian community outside Armenia; an estimated 200,000 Armenians live in Los Angeles County alone and every year thousands of people march throughout the streets of Los Angeles to demand that the killings be officially recognized as genocide.\nFor Armenian Americans such as Jamushian, the passage of a congressional resolution would hold symbolic resonance.\nHis mother came to the United States in 1921 and lived in Fresno until her death in 2012. She was 4 at the start of the killings and always had a hard time talking about what happened to her.\n\"She had dagger wounds in her stomach and at the base of her head,\" he said. \"She was left for dead.\"\n"

        "text": "Two Missouri abortion advocates will testify on Capitol Hill Thursday when the U.S. House holds a hearing on state efforts to restrict abortion. Dr. Colleen McNicholas, chief medical officer for Planned Parenthood's St. Louis clinic, will address the House Committee on Oversight and Reform. Her testimony comes after it was revealed last month that the Missouri Department of Health and Senior Services tracked the menstrual cycles of clinic patients. The information was compiled as part of an investigation into cases of women who suffered post-abortion complications. The revelation from a licensing hearing earlier this month has sparked national outrage and heightened scrutiny of Missouri's abortion restrictions, which are currently among the toughest in the nation. Here's how strict Missouri's new abortion law is Missouri's new abortion law, set to take effect Aug. 28, includes many new restrictions. BY NEIL NAKAHODO Rep. William Lacy Clay, D-Missouri, a member of the committee, Missouri has become the laughingstock of the country when it comes to reproductive rights. \"Here we have a state agency that tracks the menstrual periods of women. What have we devolved to as a state? It's embarrassing,\" Lacy Clay said. Both Missouri Gov. Mike Parson's office and the Missouri Department of Health and Senior Services declined to comment on the congressional hearing. The other Missouri woman who will testify at the hearing is Jeni Box, a Kansas City native who now lives in the St. Louis suburbs. Box made the painful decision to terminate a pregnancy in 2018 after doctor diagnosed that her baby would be born with a rare and likely fatal genetic disorder. Box has been outspoken in her opposition to a new Missouri law that restricts abortions even in cases where there are diagnoses of fatal disorders. In addition to the two Missouri witnesses, representatives from the National Women's Law Center and the National Black Women's Reproductive Justice Agenda will also address the Democratic-controlled committee. Conservative pundit Allie Stuckey will serve as a witness for minority Republicans.\n"

        "text": "The Republican National Committee is pouring another $1 million into the Louisiana governor's race ahead of Saturday's runoff \u2014 a move that comes amid mounting GOP concerns about losing a second major election in a conservative state in as many weeks.\nThe last-minute spending doubles the committee's investment in the race, where Republican Eddie Rispone is trying to unseat Democratic incumbent John Bel Edwards. President Donald Trump is set to headline a rally for Rispone in Louisiana on Thursday evening, barreling ahead despite worries within the GOP that Edwards is a slight favorite to win.\nTrump had bet that a GOP sweep in three gubernatorial races this fall would project political strength in the face of impeachment. But after Republican Gov. Matt Bevin's apparent defeat in Kentucky last week, and with Rispone locked in a neck-and-neck race, the president is facing the possibility of losing two out of three.\nThe Thursday rally will be the third time Trump has campaigned for Republicans in the gubernatorial contest. He has also recorded get-out-vote videos and robocalls, and on Friday Vice President Mike Pence is expected to call into Louisiana radio stations to make a late pitch for Rispone. It's an extraordinary level of involvement for a president whose own election is less than a year away.\nThe RNC has spent $2 million and deployed 60 paid staffers to try to unseat Edwards, a prime GOP target given the heavy Republican tilt of the state. The committee's latest spending is for final get-out-the vote efforts, according to a party official. The RNC is closely aligned with the president's political operation.\nThose familiar with the investment stress the committee is confident in Rispone's prospects and is eager to knock off an incumbent Democratic governor long seen as formidable. They say the committee \u2014 with $59 million on hand, more than six times its Democratic counterpart \u2014 can afford to spend on competitive races.\nMuch of the Republican consternation surrounds increased turnout among black voters during early voting, which concluded Saturday. African Americans accounted for 31 percent of early voters in the runoff, an increase from 25 percent during the first round of voting in October, in which candidates from all parties competed with the top two advancing. Democrats accounted for 46 percent of early runoff voters, up from 44 percent in the primary.\n\"Clearly Democrats are more energized than they were in the primary,\" said John Couvillon, a Louisiana-based pollster who typically works with Republicans.\nCouvillon attributed the rise in African American involvement to backlash over Trump's outsize involvement in the contest. A desire to ensure there is a check on Republicans in the state capitol also likely played a role, he added.\n\"I think the odds are better for Edwards in the runoff than I thought they were on primary night,\" said Couvillon, who called the early voting results \"fairly bad\" for Rispone.\nOthers, however, paint a more optimistic picture for Rispone. The increased black turnout during the early voting period only means that fewer will turn out on Election Day, some Republicans say. They also argue the state has long had a huge number of registered Democrats who typically vote Republican.\n\"From a macro view, it looks like the governor is performing exceedingly well in early voting,\" said Lionel Rainey, a Louisiana-based Republican strategist who worked for Rispone's primary opponent, Rep. Ralph Abraham. \"But if you actually look at who the voters are, Eddie did much better than you would think. I think it's a very tight race.\"\nPublic polling has depicted a close contest, with recent surveys showing Edwards ahead but within the margin of error. Internal RNC data also shows Edwards on top but Rispone within striking distance, according to a person familiar with the research.\n\nTrump, who won Louisiana by nearly 20 points in 2016, is a dominant figure in the race. Rispone, a wealthy businessman and 70-year-old first-time candidate, has aired TV commercials tying his Democratic opponent to the impeachment push as well as ads showing footage of Trump attacking Edwards.\nStanding next to the president at a rally last week, Rispone lavished praise on the commander in chief and called Louisiana \"Trump country.\"\nEdwards, a conservative Democrat who opposes abortion rights and supports gun rights, has dealt with Trump gingerly. Despite the scorching attacks, the governor insists he has a positive working relationship with the president. Earlier this year, he ran a TV spot promoting a Trump visit to Southwest Louisiana.\nTrump has taken a personal interest in the race, asking aides and allies for updates and sending out a stream of texts promoting Rispone and bashing Edwards. People close to the president say he has come to view the Louisiana contest as a referendum on himself \u2014 much as he did with the races in Kentucky and Mississippi (which Republican Tate Reeves won). Trump claimed credit after Edwards failed to receive a majority of the vote in the primary, forcing a runoff.\nBut Trump is risking a second loss despite going all-in: He held a rally for Bevin the night before the election, only to watch him fall short. Edwards is a relatively popular incumbent, and some people in the president's orbit are concerned that Trump has left himself exposed to criticism if Rispone loses.\nOthers in the Trump camp disagree, saying he'd likely be blamed for a loss whether he campaigned or not.\nOne of the biggest unanswered questions heading into the final stretch is the impact of this week's impeachment hearings \u2014 specifically, whether it turns out conservative voters in the state's rural areas who otherwise would have stayed home.\nRoy Fletcher, a veteran GOP strategist in Louisiana, said the early vote totals were \"really bad news for Rispone,\" but added that the prospect of heavy rural turnout on Election Day gives the Republican candidate hope.\n\"It's a little harder than the governor's [path],\" Fletcher said, \"but it's doable.\"\n"

        "text": "City officials are looking to award nearly $500,000 in contracts to 16 private law firms for work that includes negotiating union contracts and defending Paterson against lawsuits.\nThe City Council briefly discussed the contracts during its meeting last week and agreed to hold a vote on approving the contracts on Nov. 26.\nIn response to questions from the council, Mayor Andre Sayegh's law director, Farrah Irving, said last week that most of the firms getting new contracts had worked for the city during the previous year.\nIn Sayegh's first year as mayor, Paterson paid private law firms $1.45 million in fees, which represented a 14% reduction.\nUnder Sayegh, the city expanded its list of private law firms, adding several with strong political connections. Those included Rainone, Coughlin, Minchello, a Woodbridge firm in which state Assembly Speaker Craig Coughlin, a Democrat, is a partner, and O'Toole Scrivo, a Cedar Grove firm in which Republican Kevin O' Toole, a former state legislator who is now chairman of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, is managing partner.\nIrving told the council that the law firms being retained were picked based on their experience and track records.\nHere's a breakdown of the proposed contracts:\n\u2022\t$60,000 to Archer and Greiner of Haddonfield for legal work on bonding.\n\u2022\t$30,000 each for labor attorney work for O'Toole's firm and Newark-based Adams, Gutierrez, Lattiboudere.\n\u2022\t$50,000 apiece for Lite Depalma Greenberg of Newark, Florio, Perrucci, Steinhardt, Cappelli of Rochelle Park, Weiner Law Group of Parsippany and Coughlin's firm.\n\u2022\t$40,000 for workers' compensation work for Buglione, Hutton and DeYoe of Wayne.

Officials said the partner in the Northfield-based firm who has the same last name as the mayor is not related to him.\n\u2022\t$15,000 for tax appeal work for Florio, Kenny, Raval.\n\u2022\t$10,000 to serve as redevelopment attorney to Michael Armstrong and Associates of Willingboro.\nDuring the past decade, private law firms hired by the city ended up performing more work than was covered by the contracts and the council then increased the amounts.\nIn Sayegh's first year as mayor, the law director, Khaliah Shabazz, broke from the past practice of setting maximum amounts in the firms' contracts. Shabazz resigned during the summer and subsequently has gotten a contract to do legal work for the Paterson school district. Under Irving, the Paterson law department has resumed the former practice of setting limits on the private law firms' contracts.\n"

        "text": "House Democrats are moving aggressively to wrap up their historic, weeks-long investigation into President Trump before 2020, potentially setting up a climactic vote to impeach him just before Christmas.\n\nThe timeline has come into sharper focus as Democrats have made a series of critical moves signaling they are shutting down the closed-door fact-finding phase of the inquiry and shifting now to Phase 2: making the case for impeachment to the American public.\n\n{mosads}Congressional investigators, led by House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff (D-Calif.), appear to have wrapped up the last of 15 private depositions of current and former Trump administration officials. This week they began publishing thousands of pages of transcripts from those interviews.\n\nAnd next week, Democrats will launch the first public, televised hearings of their nearly seven-week-long impeachment inquiry, calling three career foreign service officials who have already testified that Trump, his personal attorney Rudy Giuliani and their allies were seeking a brazen quid pro quo with Ukraine.\n\n\"I think, without being hasty, again, but being expeditious and deliberative, that the House ought to set for themselves a target of having dealt with this in the Intelligence Committee and Foreign Affairs and Oversight and the Judiciary Committee and on the floor by Christmas,\" Rep. Denny Heck (D-Wash.), a member of the Intelligence Committee, told CNN's \"The Situation Room\" on Thursday night.\n\n\"That's a tough schedule. But it's a doable schedule, given where we're at and all the work that's been done thus far,\" Heck said.\n\nThere are other signs that Democrats are charging toward a December floor vote to make Trump just the third president in U.S. history to be impeached.\n\nSeveral top Trump officials who played pivotal roles in the administration's dealings with Ukraine \u2014 including Energy Secretary Rick Perry and acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney \u2014 have defied subpoenas compelling them to testify behind closed doors, but Democrats have shown little appetite to resolve the matter in court.\n\nAfter watching their Mueller and Russia probes get bogged down in never-ending court battles, Democrats appear to be moving on without testimony from those key witnesses rather than engage in another lengthy lawsuit against the administration.\n\n\"We're not going to delay our work. That would merely allow these witnesses and the White House to succeed with their goal, which is to delay, deny, obstruct,\" Schiff recently said.\n\nIf Democrats can stick to their aggressive timetable, they could be on track to reach the end of their impeachment inquiry in the days right before Christmas.\n\nSpeaker Nancy Pelosi (Calif.) and other Democrats insist that they'll take as long as the process requires, but many hope it can be wrapped up before the presidential campaign begins in earnest with the Iowa caucuses on Feb. 3.\n\nTo speed things along, Democrats have indicated their witness list for the public hearings will be limited. That means they will only bring in people who offered the most detailed or firsthand knowledge of events during earlier closed-door appearances.\n\n{mossecondads}\"The Majority does not intend to request public testimony from every witness who previously testified in depositions or interviews as part of the impeachment inquiry,\" Schiff wrote in a letter to Rep. Devin Nunes (Calif.), the top Republican on the Intelligence panel, offering the opportunity for the minority to request public witnesses. Democrats have veto power over any GOP requests.\n\nThe public hearings will start with a bang on Wednesday when Democrats call William Taylor, the acting U.S. ambassador to Ukraine who testified it was his \"clear understanding\" that the administration was withholding nearly $400 million in military aid until Kiev opened investigations into Trump's political opponents, including former Vice President Joe Biden.\n\nGeorge Kent, another top State Department official, also will appear before Congress that day.\n\nThen on Friday, Marie Yovanovitch, the former ambassador to Ukraine who was recalled from her post due to perceived insufficient loyalty to Trump, will go before the cameras.\n\n\"Giuliani and his team were running a shadow operation of U.S. foreign policy. The real public servants of America were trying to dislodge corruption, and Giuliani and his team were trying to exploit corruption and deepen corruption,\" Rep. Jamie Raskin (D-Md.), a member of the Oversight and Judiciary committees who has been attending the private depositions, told The Hill.\n\n\"The Ukraine shakedown was not some kind of aberration but rather the expression of the complete policy on the part of the president,\" Raskin added. \"The goal of public hearings is to situate the president's potential high crimes and misdemeanors within a comprehensible history.\"\n\nThose three hearings will be followed by second week of public testimony before Congress adjourns for a weeklong break for the Thanksgiving holiday. Two National Security Council staffers, Fiona Hill and Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman, are among those who could be called to testify then.\n\nSometime in early December, Schiff \u2014 along with the chairs of other two investigating committees \u2014 is expected to forward a report and recommendations for articles of impeachment to Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler (D-N.Y.), who is in charge of the third phase of impeachment. The veteran lawmaker will be tasked with figuring out which articles get sent to the House floor for a vote.\n\nNadler also could hold public hearings, where the president and his counsel could be present, though it remains unclear whether the Judiciary panel plans to take those steps.\n\n\"It depends on, does the president or minority want to call witnesses who haven't been fact witnesses, who haven't been testified already. I don't know that. \u2026 We'll have to see,\" Nadler said on MSNBC's \"All in with Chris Hayes.\"\n\nFrom there, the 41-member Judiciary Committee would draft articles of impeachment \u2014 likely focusing on things like abuse of power and obstruction of justice \u2014 and vote to send them to the House floor. Only then would all House lawmakers be able to vote on impeachment, potentially the week before Christmas.\n\nFrom there the impeachment process would move over to the Senate, which under current rules would be required to conduct a trial that could take weeks to complete. Both parties have a political incentive for an expeditious trial that could arrive as soon as January: Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) wants to quickly acquit Trump so Republicans can shift to other priorities like confirming judges; Democrats don't want their 2020 presidential hopefuls, like Sens. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and Kamala Harris (D-Calif.), to get stuck in a lengthy, inside-the-Beltway impeachment trial.\n\nOne possible complication to the emerging timeline is the fact that lawmakers also need to figure out how to avoid another government shutdown amid the partisan acrimony.\n\nGovernment funding expires on Nov. 21. But given the lack of progress on appropriations \u2014 despite a bipartisan budget deal struck in late July \u2014 congressional leaders are eyeing another stopgap measure to extend funding to sometime in December.\n\nThat means the House could be faced with an impeachment vote just as the threat of another holiday-season shutdown looms.\n\nHouse Majority Leader Steny Hoyer (D-Md.) said in a letter to colleagues on Friday that he is \"hopeful\" lawmakers can fully fund the government before year's end, even amid the impeachment fight.\n\n\"The House is continuing to do important work for the people, even as our committees continue the impeachment inquiry. We can, and we will, continue to make progress on critical issues while upholding our Constitutional duty,\" Hoyer wrote."

Jane Swift unique status.\nAnd not because of what she did as governor, but because of what she hasn't done after.\nSwift, who served for the remainder of the late Gov. Paul Celluci's term from 2001 to 2003, would become the only living former Massachusetts governor who hasn't run for president, if Patrick does indeed run.\nGov. Mitt Romney ran twice \u2014 first in 2008 and then in 2012, when he won the Republican nomination but lost to President Barack Obama. Gov. Bill Weld is currently running in the Republican primary against President Donald Trump. And Gov. Michael Dukakis won the Democratic nomination in 1988, but lost to President George H.W. Bush.\nThe remarkable trend was not lost in the wake of The New York Times\u2018 scoop that Patrick might jump into the 2020 race, even if some observers did leave out Swift.\nBut wait, can we be sure she won't also jump into the race? According to Swift, we can.\n\"The only running I am doing is the standard #roadrace type,\" the former Republican governor, who has since made a career as an education executive, tweeted Monday night in response to an inquiring Twitter user.\n\"The fact that I am heading to #Wisconsin for a winter 10 miler is just a weird coincidence,\" she added.\nSwift went on to say she is used to being an \"outlier\" in the club of former Massachusetts governors. After all, she remains the only woman to have ever served as the Bay State's governor and was the country's youngest-ever female governor.\n\"Add this to the list,\" Swift wrote Monday.\nAn avid runner (at least according to her periodic posts and photos on Twitter), the 54-year-old joked that she could probably at least beat her peers in a 10K race or half-marathon, even if Patrick \"looks pretty fit.\"\nNo word yet on whether Patrick or any of Swift's other peers will step up to her challenge of an actual long-distance race.\nHowever, if Patrick does decide to join the presidential race, it would mean that every single occupant of the State House's corner office from the beginning of Dukakis's second stint in 1983 to 2015 \u2014 with the exception of the less than five-and-a-half year period when Cellucci and Swift served \u2014 has run for the White House.\nPatrick, who was governor from 2007 to 2015, would also add to the preponderance of Massachusetts natives and elected officials who have already entered the 2020 field.\nIn addition to Weld's anti-Trump campaign in the GOP primary, Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren is among the top-tier candidates in contention for the Democratic nomination. Rep. Seth Moulton also had a short-lived run in the 2020 race. New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio, who grew up in Cambridge, also briefly gave it a shot.\nAnd, like Patrick, former New York City mayor and Medford native Michael Bloomberg is now also reportedly reconsidering his decision not to run. Mike Gravel, a former Alaska senator and Springfield native, (or at least, several of his teenage supporters) also launched a quixotic, mostly-online campaign.\nThere are also candidates with somewhat looser Massachusetts connections (there's always one).\nSouth Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg and Julian Castro, a former San Antonio mayor and housing secretary, both attended Harvard (Buttigieg for his undergraduate degree; Castro for law school). Former Vice President Joe Biden's new super PAC even has Boston ties.\nDespite Bay Staters' apparent interest in the White House, there is another noteworthy pattern: Their recent penchant for losing general elections. In addition to Dukakis and Romney, former Massachusetts Sen. John Kerry also came up short in 2004.\nTo find the last Bay Stater who actually won a presidential election, you have to go back to President John F. Kennedy \u2014 or, if we're being generous, President George H.W. Bush, who was born in Milton, but is more closely tied to Texas and Maine.\nAnd, of course, that's only if you don't count former Somerville resident Barack Obama."

        "text": "Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee Chairman Ron Johnson (R-Wis.) opened the door on Thursday to subpoenaing a cadre of top Republican targets as part of his panel's oversight work. \nPressed if he would issue subpoenas for House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff (D-Calif.), former Vice President Biden or his son Hunter Biden or the whistleblower at the center of the impeachment inquiry, Johnson stressed that he was still trying to collect information.  \n\"I don't really want to make news on your program because I'm working with Senator Grassley's staff, but we're having meetings in terms of what our next steps are,\" Johnson told WSAU, a Wisconsin radio station on Thursday.\n\"I'm not going to get out ahead of my skis here. \u2026In order to bring in witnesses for questioning you want to lay the groundwork,\" Johnson continued. \"[A] subpoena is the last step in the process, you go through a multiple step process.\"  \nAsked by the talk radio host if he was willing to say that the Bidens, the whistleblower and Schiff would be subpoenaed \"once he got to the bottom of all this,\" Johnson added \"unless they cooperate willingly, and that may happen.\" \n\"If not, yeah I have that subpoena power and I'm not afraid to use it,\" he said.\nAsked if he was willing to say he would use it, Johnson added: \"I will use it.\"\nJohnson and Senate Finance Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) have fired off a flurry of oversight letters, including requesting any State Department records involving Hunter Biden or Ukraine gas company Burisma. \nJohnson's radio interview comes as conservatives have fumed over the House's impeachment inquiry, which is investigating whether not Trump tied Ukraine aid to the country opening an investigation into former Vice President Biden and his son Hunter Biden.\nHouse Republicans tried to call the whistleblower, who filed a complaint that helped guide the investigation, as well as Hunter Biden as witnesses in the public impeachment inquiry hearings. But Democrats rejected their request.\nSenate Judiciary Committee Chairman Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) has also come under fierce pressure from the right to call Schiff to testify before his panel. Graham has ruled out calling Schiff, but said during a Fox News interview this week that he believes the Democratic lawmaker should be called as part of an impeachment trial.\nSen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) separately told reporters on Thursday that he was considering forcing a vote on the Senate floor to try to allow the White House to call its preferred witnesses, including Hunter Biden.\n\"I believe very strongly the president should be able to call his own witnesses. \u2026The rules that are put forward will be amendable, and so yes I will consider strongly that the president should get his full due process, which to me means bringing in his own witnesses,\" Paul said.

        "text": "President Trump on Thursday moved to dismiss a lawsuit filed by an aide to former national security adviser John Bolton who was seeking a ruling on whether he must comply with a congressional subpoena to testify in the House impeachment inquiry.\nThe filing to the U.S. District Court in Washington, D.C., cited Trump's official capacity as president. In it, he sought to have a judge dismiss White House official Dr. Charles Kupperman's lawsuit seeking guidance on whether he should comply with the subpoena or the president's directive not to cooperate.\nA representative for Trump argued that the president's direction should supersede any prospective court ruling.\n\"Although Dr. Kupperman claims that he needs this Court's guidance as to whether he should comply with the House's attempt to subpoena his testimony, he already knows the answer,\" the filing states. \"He should follow the directive of his former employer (the President) to not testify pursuant to the President's invocation of Dr. Kupperman's absolute immunity from testimonial compulsion.\"\nThe filing argues that the \"proper course\" would be for Kupperman to abide by Trump's insistence that his administration not cooperate with the impeachment process rather than whatever a judge ultimately determines.\nIt also cites that the former aide should not comply because he dealt with matters pertaining to the president and worked in close proximity to him. \nThe filing lays out some of Kupperman's roles on the national security council. It noted that he was present in meetings with Trump and on calls with heads of state, that he advised or prepared advice for the president, that he communicated the president's decisions to others in the executive branch and that his title denoted him as one of Trump's most senior aides.\n\"Leaving the President's senior most aides open to compelled congressional testimony would allow Congress to encroach upon the independence and autonomy of the Presidency\u2026 to reveal the President's thinking or influence his decision-making on sensitive or controversial matters,\" the filing states.\nHouse Democrats are pursuing an impeachment inquiry into whether Trump abused his office by pressuring the Ukrainian government to investigate a domestic political rival.\nSeveral current and former administration officials have given private testimony to lawmakers in the investigation after being subpoenaed to do so. The first two witnesses to testify publicly on Wednesday did so under subpoena.\n{mosads}While Republicans have argued none of the witnesses have first-hand information about alleged wrongdoing, the White House has blocked most of those who would have first-hand information from testifying. Kupperman would represent a witness with more direct access to the president.\nBut Kupperman filed a lawsuit seeking a resolution on whether to comply with the subpoena or with the president's instructions. House Democrats withdrew the subpoena last week in an acknowledgement that Kupperman's lawsuit could lead to a drawn out process.\nAn attorney representing both Kupperman and Bolton said this week that the two men would be willing to testify if the courts rule that they should comply with the congressional subpoena.\nIn a curious move, lawyers for acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney indicated he would join Kupperman's lawsuit last week. Mulvaney was subpoenaed for testimony but has not complied.\nOn Tuesday, Mulvaney reversed course and said he would not seek to join Kupperman's lawsuit and would instead follow Trump's instructions to ignore the subpoena."

But whether the hearing in Washington was seen as a partisan charade or a damning blow to President Donald Trump depended largely on a person's preexisting political sympathies.\nTo better understand how the hearings are playing across the nation, reporters for The New York Times are listening to callers and hosts on talk radio shows on both ends of the political spectrum. Some shows are national, some local. They are playing in markets across the country. This is what is being said:\n\u2014 WCPT 820 AM Chicago: \u2018The evidence is already there'\nThe evidence?

He predicted that there would not be enough senators to remove Trump from office. But perhaps there would be \"enough to raise eyebrows\" and doom the president politically.\n\"His reelection, to me, is over,\" Roosevelt said. \"That middle is going to get shifted over to the Democratic side.\"\nAll through the morning drive, callers on Chicago's liberal talk station voiced outrage about the president but offered mixed views of what impeachment would mean.\nBrad from Elk Grove Village said he was \"doing good \u2014 and better every day now that we've finally got this in front of the public.\" Ronald said Democrats should stay focused on other priorities, too. Louis said the Democratic presidential candidate platforms had been overshadowed by the impeachment hearings.\nIn addition to disgust for Trump, many callers shared one nagging concern: that the other side was unlikely to be persuaded.\n\"Impeach Trump: the evidence is already there,\" a caller named Pam said. \"It's just a matter of exposing it to the public.

He dismissed the possibility that Trump tried to bribe Ukraine.

        "title": "Trump Again Misunderstands California's Wildfires",
        "text": "For the second year in a row, President Donald Trump inaccurately attributed California's rash of wildfires to poor forest management. He also falsely said other states don't have \"close to the level of burn\" as California.\nMost of the Golden State's latest blazes aren't in forests, experts explained, and therefore aren't the types of fires that would benefit from better forest management. Wildfires also aren't limited to California, even if the state gets more attention for them. So far this year, for example, wildfires in Alaska have burned nearly 10 times as much land as those in California.\nTrump's comments began on the morning of Nov. 3, as firefighters in California were battling numerous fires across the state, including the Kincade Fire west of Sacramento and the Getty Fire in Los Angeles. \nIn a series of three tweets, the president attacked California Governor Gavin Newsom, saying he had done a \"terrible job of forest management\" and that he \"must \u2018clean' his forest floors,\" adding, \"You don't see close to the level of burn in other states.\"\nWithin hours, Newsom replied via tweet: \"You don't believe in climate change. You are excused from this conversation.\"\nLater in the day, the president again blamed the fires on \"bad\" management and criticized the governor, telling reporters on the South Lawn that \"it's always California. Never \u2014 it's rarely somebody else or someplace else.\"\nTrump, Nov. 3: [Y]ou've got fires eating away at California every year because management is so bad. The governor doesn't know \u2014 he's like a child. He doesn't know what he's doing. And I've been telling this for two years: They've got to take care of it. Every year, it's always California. Never \u2014 it's rarely somebody else or someplace else.\nNot Just California\nWildfires, of course, do happen elsewhere. According to the National Interagency Fire Center, an average of 61,375 human-caused wildfires occur every year across the U.S., of which approximately 7,500, or 12%, are in California.\nAnd contrary to Trump's claim that other states don't have \"close to the level of burn\" as California, other states often outrank California in terms of acres burned. As of Nov. 5, more than 2.5 million acres had gone up in flames in Alaska this year, compared with fewer than 300,000 in California.\nFigures reported to the fire center show that in 2017, both Nevada and Montana had more burned land than California, and in 2016 Oklahoma did. In 2015, Alaska had the most scorched land \u2014 more than 5 million acres \u2014 followed by Washington.\nEven in 2018, when California's 1.8 million burned acres totaled more than any other state, other states racked up substantial acreage as well, including Nevada, with more than 1 million acres, and Oregon, with nearly 900,000 acres. \nOf the 198 largest U.S. wildfires between 1997 and 2018, agency statistics show that 49 occurred in Alaska, 26 were in Idaho, and 23 were in California.\nCalifornia, then, is by no means the only state with wildfires. Still, it is true that California is highly susceptible to wildfires and is home to some of the most costly and destructive fires.\nCalifornia's high risk, experts said, is explained by natural climate features and its massive population.\n\"There are lots of areas that have as many or more fires than California,\" said University of Utah fire scientist Philip Dennison. \"The difference with California is [that] it has a very large population.\" With 40 million people, he added, just about any fire that starts will impact someone, which is far less true in other, less populated Western states.\nUniversity of California, Los Angeles climate scientist Daniel Swain also pointed to the Golden State's climate and geography, which he said \"sets it completely apart from any other region in the United States\" and leaves it more susceptible to extreme wildfire than virtually anywhere else in the nation. \nThe state, he said, goes for a long time without rain \u2014 a period that coincides with high temperatures in the summer \u2014 and then seasonal winds come in during autumn when vegetation is very dry. \"When the vegetation is as explosively flammable as it is in California toward the end of the dry season,\" he said, \"it's surprisingly easy to spark a wildfire.\"\n\"California also has far more people living in high risk wildfire zones than any other state in the country,\" Swain added. \"Given these facts, it's quite clear why the overall human exposure to wildfire risk is greater in California than in other states.\"\nManagement to Blame?\nAs we explained last year, forest management techniques, including tree thinning and prescribed fires, can be helpful to reduce the severity of some wildfires. But these strategies aren't effective for all ecosystems \u2014 and as with 2018, the latest fires in California aren't in traditional forests.\n\"It is true that a historical policy of \u2018total fire suppression' in federal forests during much of the 20th century led to a lack of beneficial, low-intensity fire,\" said Swain, referring to a longstanding practice of quickly snuffing out wildfires across much of the West. \"In those regions, present-day wildfires tend to burn more intensely than they would have in a more natural setting.\"\nBut, he added, that's not the situation for the latest fires. Southern California's fires are burning \"almost exclusively\" in dry brush and grasses, he said, while the landscape around the Kincade Fire is a patchwork of forest, brush and grass. The forest that is there, he noted, is largely not coniferous, which is the main type of forest \"where the historical legacy of fire suppression is most relevant.\"\nDennison told us that weather conditions, too, limit the impact that management would have, and that \"cleaning\" the forest floor, as Trump suggested, \"wouldn't help with the recent fires.\"\n\"There are places where fuel management is appropriate to reduce the risk of ignition or to make fire easier to control,\" he said. \"But in the high wind situations that we saw over the last couple of weeks, there's not much you can do.\"\nIndeed, California's current spate of wildfires coincides, as it did in 2018, with dry, hot weather and extreme winds, known as the Santa Ana winds in the south and the Diablo winds in the north. The conditions make it easy for fires to start, and once ignited, to quickly spread.\nTinderbox conditions, of course, still need a spark, and in California, the culprit is usually a person or something related to humans, such as a downed power line. \nClimate change, too, may be a factor in making fires more severe, because more hot weather can further dry out already dry vegetation, Swain said, and precipitation declines may delay the start of the rainy season.\n\"Recent years (2017, 2018, and 2019) have each featured an unusually late onset of the rainy season in California and unusually late seasonal occurrence of extreme fire weather conditions,\" he said, \"consistent with expectations of autumn drying and warming due to climate change.\"\nAt the same time, it's worth noting that the link between climate change and fire risk is variable, and depends on location. Alexandra Syphard, a senior research scientist at the nonprofit Conservation Biology Institute, said that for interior forests, there is a significant relationship between temperature and precipitation and an increased risk of fires \u2014 and in those forests, there's \"a very good chance\" climate change could be exacerbating blazes. But in Southern or coastal California, that link is less clear. \nIn a 2016 study she co-authored, Syphard found little or no statistical relationship between climate and fire severity at low-elevations or in Southern California. One reason for that, she said, could be that if conditions are already ripe for a fire, climate change can't make it much worse.\nIn a subsequent study, Syphard, who is also chief scientist for a wildfire-focused insurance company, found that in places where there isn't a strong relationship between climate and fire activity, there usually is a strong human presence. \"What that suggests is that human influence at minimum can scramble the relationship between fire and climate,\" she said, and possibly override it.\nThis doesn't necessarily mean that climate isn't important, Syphard said, but it does suggest that there are proactive measures people can take to reduce wildfire risk, such as plugging gaps in roofs or putting screens on vents to prevent embers from igniting homes, as well as not continuing to build in the most fire-prone areas along the wildland-urban interface.\n\"By talking only about climate you're missing part of the equation,\" she said. \"Climate is something that requires action, but by attributing everything to climate it is playing down things that we could do otherwise.\"\nFinally, fire experts were mystified by Trump's suggestion to \"open up the ridiculously closed water lanes coming down from the North.\"\n\"Using water in rivers or irrigation canals isn't practical for keeping large areas from burning,\" explained Dennison.\nSyphard agreed that firefighting efforts were not being hampered by a lack of water in the state. \"Adding more water,\" she said, \"is not going to improve the situation.\"\n"

        "text": "A federal judge excoriated Justice Department officials Thursday for their handling of potential criminal charges against former Deputy FBI Director Andrew McCabe, saying the continued uncertainty over the prosecution was unfair to McCabe and the public.\n\"This is not a hard case,\" U.S. District Court Judge Reggie Walton said. \"I was a good prosecutor for a long time. Deciding whether or not you're going to charge someone with false statements or perjury is not that hard, factually or legally \u2014 maybe politically, but not factually or legally.\"\nWalton, a George W. Bush appointee overseeing a Freedom of Information Act lawsuit filed by a watchdog group to obtain records about McCabe's firing, complained at a hearing Thursday afternoon that the Justice Department claims about an ongoing potential prosecution of McCabe may have been a \"smoke screen\" to persuade the judge to forestall the case demanding documents.\n\"Shouldn't I know whether the wool was being pulled over my eyes?\" Walton said. \"I do have concerns about whether I was being manipulated into stopping this case from moving forward.\"\n\"Your Honor, the wool was not being pulled over your eyes,\" Justice Department attorney Justin Sandberg said. He insisted claims lawyers made in a secret court filing and closed-door audience with the judge in September were accurate.\nFor about a year, the Justice Department has maintained that most of the records sought in the FOIA case were off-limits because of an ongoing enforcement action, widely believed to be the government's investigation aimed at deciding whether to bring charges against McCabe for allegedly lying to FBI colleagues about contacts with the media prior to the 2016 presidential election.\nAfter more than 20 years at the FBI, McCabe was fired last year following findings by the Justice Department inspector general and the FBI's Office of Professional Responsibility that he displayed a \"lack of candor\" in his dealings with internal investigators and a top Justice Department official.\nA criminal investigation followed along with reports that McCabe was on the verge of indictment two months ago, but no indictment ever emerged. Requests from McCabe's attorneys for clarity have been ignored by prosecutors.\nMcCabe's lawyers say the criminal inquiry and his firing were both tainted by a campaign of public invective from President Donald Trump, who has repeatedly denounced McCabe on Twitter, calling him a \"major sleazebag\" and celebrating his firing as \"a great day for the FBI.\"\nOn Wednesday, government lawyers reversed course in the FOIA suit and said they would no longer argue that records about the investigation into McCabe needed to be withheld because of a pending enforcement proceeding.\nHowever, they remained circumspect about McCabe, further adding to the mystery about his status. That vagueness clearly fueled the judge's concern that he might have been tricked into delaying the FOIA case with a spurious claim that charges against the former FBI official were still being mulled.\nWhen Walton pressed about what has changed since, Sandberg was exceedingly vague.\n\"Obviously, you know that time has passed. There's various proceedings the government has to consider and various interests the government has to consider,\" the Justice Department attorney said.\nWalton said something must have precipitated the shift.\n\"I don't know what's going on behind closed doors as far as the \u2026 potential prosecution of Mr. McCabe is concerned. ... Something must've happened,\" the judge said.\nSoon after that exchange Thursday, Walton ordered Sandberg and J.P. Cooney, a prosecutor from the U.S. Attorney's Office, to join a closed-door court session to explore the grounds for the change. Walton ordered the \"ex parte\" exchange even though the answers the judge would get from it would likely be unsatisfying, apparently because the Justice Department does not believe it is obligated to explain its decision-making to the judge.\nDuring the earlier, public portion of the hearing, a lawyer for the group pursuing the FOIA suit said the reversal merits some explication from the Justice Department.\n\"We believe we are, at a minimum, entitled to an explanation for why now, abruptly, the government has withdrawn its \u2026 claim,\" said Anne Weismann of Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington.\nWeismann noted McCabe has filed a civil suit over his firing and is arguing that the Justice Department violated procedure in a dismissal that seems to have been aimed at terminating him just before he would have been eligible for retirement benefits.\nOne FBI policy calls for 30-day notice before being fired, but states that can be reduced to seven days in cases involving evidence of a crime.\nWeismann said the Justice Department may be posturing about prosecuting McCabe to improve its legal standing in the lawsuit he filed. \"If there's no crime, the government faces a vulnerability in its decision to give Mr. McCabe only seven days and not 30 days,\" she said.\nHowever, Sandberg complained CREW was trying to use the FOIA case to manage the Justice Department's process for seeking criminal charges.\n\"FOIA does not permit the plaintiff to sort of superintend criminal proceedings,\" the DOJ lawyer said.\nSandberg also said it would be \"perverse\" for the government to suffer any consequences for its reversal, which he said would allow more information to flow to the public.\nAfter the closed-door session Thursday, Walton did not indicate publicly what had transpired, but ordered DOJ to start releasing the documents demanded in the case. He also indicated that he planned to unseal a declaration the Justice Department filed in March explaining the ongoing enforcement proceedings that justified withholding the records CREW requested.\nIn an interview earlier Thursday, McCabe said he'd still gotten no definitive word about the state of the criminal probe he faced, and he added that he wasn't sure what to make of the government's course change in the FOIA case.\n\"There's certainly different ways you can interpret it,\" McCabe told CNN's John Berman. \"I am still waiting to be told directly by the Justice Department that they have abandoned this completely baseless effort to try to charge me. I, of course, have not done anything wrong and \u2026 I'll be happy to get that call if and when it comes.\"\n"

The former Massachusetts governor had previously rejected the idea, but explained why he changed his mind in an interview with CBS This Morning Thursday.\n\"You can't know if you can break through if you don't get out there and try,\" Patrick told CBS. \"I've been waiting for a moment like this my whole life. By that I don't mean a moment to run for president, but a moment when the appetite for big ideas is big enough for the size of the challenges we face in America.\"\nPatrick is now the 18th candidate in the Democatic field for president.

Right now we have a really talented, really gifted and a very hard working and hard sacrificing field of Democratic candidates, many of them my personal friends,\" Patrick said.\n\"But we seem to be migrating to, on the one camp, sort of nostalgia, let's just get rid, if you will, of the incumbent president, and we can go back to doing what we used to do. Or, it's 'our way, our big idea or no way' and neither of those, it seems to me, seizes the moment to pull the nation together.\"\nRead: Keller: Deval Patrick Campaign Has Troubling Blind Spots\nPatrick served two terms as governor from 2007 to 2015. After leaving office he became a managing director at private equity firm Bain Capital. He had also been a CBS News contributor since September, but he will no longer serve in that role because of his decision to run.\nPatrick updated his social media accounts Thursday to show he's now a 2020 candidate and posted a video to YouTube. He highlighted his poverty-stricken childhood on Chicago's South Side, saying he's running for the \"people who feel left out and left back.\"\nAs the first in his family to go to college and law school, Patrick said, \"I've had a chance to live my American Dream.\" But over the years, the \"path to that dream\" has closed off for others, he said, as government and economy have been \"letting us down.\"\n\"In a spirit of profound gratitude for all the country has given to me, with the determination to build a better, more sustainable, more inclusive American dream for the next generation, I am today announcing my candidacy for president of the United States,\" Patrick said in the video.\nHe went to Concord, New Hampshire late Thursday morning to add his name to the ballot, just a day before the filing deadline for the 2020 primary there. He planned to meet voters in Manchester in the afternoon.\nHis move injects a new layer of uncertainty into the contest less than three months before the first votes. A popular two-term Democratic governor with a moderate bearing and close ties to former President Barack Obama, he is starting late but with a compelling life story and political resume.\nPatrick's announcement also reflects uncertainty about the direction of the Democratic contest with no commanding front-runner. Joe Biden entered the race as the presumptive favorite and maintains significant support from white moderates and black voters, whose backing is critical in a Democratic primary. But he's facing spirited challenges from Patrick's home-state senator, Elizabeth Warren, and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, progressives whose calls for fundamental economic change have alarmed moderates and wealthy donors.\nPatrick could present himself as a potential bridge across the moderate, liberal and progressive factions \u2014 as candidates like Mayor Pete Buttigieg, Sen. Kamala Harris and Sen. Cory Booker are trying to do.\nBut the former governor faces significant hurdles to raise enormous amounts of money quickly and to build an organization in the traditional early voting states that most of his rivals have focused on for the past year. And he'll have to pivot to the expensive and logistically daunting Super Tuesday contests, when voters in more than a dozen states and territories head to the polls.\nIt's also a near certainty that Patrick wouldn't make a Democratic debate stage until January, if at all, because of debate rules set by the party.\n\"Nobody has gotten into the presidential race, at least in modern times, this late in the game and somehow prevailed,\" CBS political correspondent Ed O'Keefe told WBZ-TV. \"He's got to raise millions of dollars and somehow get his name ID up beyond what it is in New England.\"\n\"It's hard to see what he is thinking,\" said WBZ-TV political analyst Jon Keller. \"It just goes to show that in politics, sometimes ego reigns supreme.\""

Charlie Baker on Thursday signed into law a bill that requires universities to share some financial information online and notify state officials if they might close, among other things.\n\"I think the folks at the Board of Higher Ed. and the folks in the Legislature did a terrific job of putting those pieces together to ensure that the commonwealth will have the access to the information,\" said Baker, a Republican. \"The commonwealth needs answers to be able to ensure people are protected and folks won't end up being surprised and damaged by the lack of available information.\"\nAt the same time, Baker added, the bill enables schools to take time and turn themselves around. \"This was a challenging issue,\" he said.\nAmong the lawmakers present at the signing ceremony was Rep. Jeffrey Roy, House chairman of the Joint Committee on Higher Education. He called the bill's signing a victory for students and their families.\n\"It's going to protect them,\" said Roy, D-Franklin. \"It's going to protect colleges and universities throughout the commonwealth.\"\nThe bill was prompted by the sudden closure of Mount Ida College in Newton in 2018, which left students scrambling to find new programs and sparked a public outcry.\nBut state regulators have said the shuttering of colleges is likely to become a more common occurrence, due largely to demographic factors. In the last five years in Massachusetts, 18 colleges have closed or merged.\nRoy recalled one of the first phone calls he received when Mount Ida closed in May 2018.\n\"The first [was] from a parent of a student who was just finishing his junior year, wondering what the family was going to do,\" he said. \"I did not want to ever get a phone call like that again.\"\nSenate President Karen Spilka said the bill is designed to prevent academic institutions from meeting the same fate that Mount Ida did without giving employees and students any warning.\n\"This bill, bottom line, will protect students in higher education from the whole Mount Ida fiasco that occurred,\" said Spilka, D-Ashland. \"This will hopefully prevent that from happening again, protect students, their families, their hard-earned money, so that they don't lose and be left in the lurch and not knowing what to do.\"\nThe new law will require higher education institutions to notify the state Board of Higher Education of any financial circumstances that may result in the college's closure or their inability to fulfill their obligations to students.\nThe state board will be required to create an assessment system to determine if a college is at risk of imminent closure. Financial screenings could be done by the board or by an accrediting agency. If a college is deemed at risk, school officials will have to inform the board and prepare a closure contingency plan that details how the school would do things like help students transfer, notify students and faculty, and preserve student records.\nWhile the screening is confidential, universities will have to publish on their website an annual public report on their finances.\nThe law also establishes training requirements for university trustees on their financial and fiduciary obligations.\nThere will be penalties for institutions that do not comply with the rules, including fines of up to $1,000 a day and the potential for revocation of an institution's degree-granting authority.\nThe bill passed both the Senate and the House unanimously.\nHouse Speaker Robert DeLeo, D-Winthrop, said in a statement after the bill passed, \"This legislation helps to protect students, families, and staff of our higher education institutions by increasing the transparency of the financial health of institutions \u2014 requiring increased oversight, reporting and accountability.\"\nBut the bill has sparked some concerns. Greg Sullivan, research director of the Pioneer Institute, a free market think tank, worried that the screenings might wrongly identify a college as being at risk of closure. If that information were leaked to the public, the school would be unable to attract students and donors, which could cause its closure.\n\"I have a problem with the Board of Higher Education basically having the ability to put a college out of business, de facto, by effectively alerting the public that the college is put on a financial death watch list,\" Sullivan said.\nSullivan noted that the bill does not lay out the process the board will use to identify at-risk schools, and he worried that the system would be vulnerable to political influences, if it is done without publicly published standards. And, he said, there is a potential conflict of interest since the Board of Higher Education is also in charge of overseeing and promoting the state's public university system.\nBaker was joined at the signing ceremony by members of the higher education chapter of SEIU Local 509.\nThe bill also has support from AICUM, the Association of Independent Colleges and Universities in Massachusetts, which had lobbied for provisions ensuring confidentiality and allowing an independent accrediting agency to conduct the financial screenings. \"Today's legislation will help ensure that our colleges and universities continue to educate our students, employ our residents, further important research and enhance our host communities,\" AICUM said in a statement.\n"

        "text": "The Democratic-led impeachment inquiry of President Donald Trump moves ahead on Thursday after an opening day of public testimony that linked Trump to a pressure campaign to force Ukraine to conduct investigations that would benefit him politically.\nThe first day of televised hearings, following weeks of closed-door interviews about Trump's dealings with Ukraine, gave a potential audience of tens of millions of Americans their first look at a probe that has ignited partisan passions ahead of the 2020 presidential campaign.\nWilliam Taylor, the acting ambassador to Ukraine, offered a new disclosure about the Republican president's keen interest in getting Ukraine to investigate Democratic political rival Joe Biden, saying a member of his staff overheard a July 26 phone call in which Trump asked about those investigations.\nAfter the call between Trump and Gordon Sondland, a former political donor appointed as a senior diplomat, the staff member asked Sondland what Trump thought about Ukraine, Taylor said.\n\"Ambassador Sondland responded that President Trump cares more about the investigations of Biden, which Giuliani was pressing for,\" Taylor testified, referring to Trump's personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani.\nTrump told reporters at a White House news conference after the hearing ended that he knew \"nothing\" about the call with Sondland. \"It's the first time I heard it,\" said Trump, who has denied any wrongdoing.\nDavid Holmes, a Taylor aide subpoenaed to testify behind closed doors on Friday in the impeachment inquiry, is the staffer who overheard the call that Sondland made to Trump from Ukraine, said a person familiar with the issue.\nRepublican lawmakers called Taylor's account hearsay and noted Ukraine's president has not said he felt pressured by Trump.\nNEW PUBLIC PHASE\nThe hearings may pave the way for the Democratic-led House of Representatives to approve articles of impeachment - formal charges - against Trump.\nThat would lead to a trial in the Senate on whether to convict Trump of those charges and remove him from office. Republicans control the Senate and have shown little support for Trump's removal.\nThe focus of the inquiry is a July 25 phone call in which Trump asked Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy to open a corruption investigation into Biden and his son Hunter, and into a discredited theory that Ukraine, not Russia, meddled in the 2016 U.S. election. Hunter Biden had been a board member for a Ukrainian energy company called Burisma.\nDemocrats are looking into whether Trump abused his power by withholding $391 million in U.S. security aid to Ukraine - a vulnerable U.S. ally facing Russian aggression - as leverage to pressure Kiev into conducting the investigations. The money - approved by the U.S. Congress to help Ukraine combat Russia-backed separatists in the eastern part of the country - was later provided to Ukraine.\nWednesday's hearing, held in an ornate hearing room packed with journalists, lawmakers and members of the public, was the first step in a new public phase of the impeachment inquiry as Democrats and Republicans each try to make their case to the public.\nRatings for the hearing are expected to be available on Thursday, giving both parties their first reading on how interested the public is.\nThe inquiry is being conducted as the 2020 presidential campaign begins to gather steam. Opinion polls show Democrats strongly back impeachment and Republicans strongly oppose it, leaving both parties appealing to a small sliver of the public - independents and others who have not made up their minds.\nAt the second public hearing on Friday, lawmakers will hear from Marie Yovanovitch, who was abruptly pulled from her post as U.S. ambassador to Ukraine in May.\nYovanovitch, who has worked for both Republican and Democratic administrations, told the impeachment inquiry behind closed doors on Oct. 11 that Trump ousted her based on \"unfounded and false claims\" after she had come under attack by Giuliani.\nYovanovitch said Giuliani's associates \"may well have believed that their personal financial ambitions were stymied by our anti-corruption policy in Ukraine.\" Trump called Yovanovitch \"bad news\" in a phone call to Zelenskiy, according to a White House summary.\nThree more public hearings are scheduled for next week.\n"

        "title": "Comparing the Trump impeachment probe to Nixon's",
        "text": "The impeachment inquiry against President Donald Trump enters a dramatic new phase this week, with the first public hearings scheduled to begin Wednesday.\nOnly the fourth president to face a congressional impeachment inquiry, Mr. Trump's congressional probe has some similarities to that which President Richard Nixon faced over the Watergate scandal, which led to his resignation in 1974. Nixon was accused of abusing his office, the same as President Trump.\nBut there are major differences, besides the differences in both the institutions of government and the media covering them. The Nixon investigation played out slowly and in public, and his legal team had a chance to mount a defense along the way, even though that defense eventually wilted. President Trump's legal team has had limited access to evidence obtained so far in closed proceedings.\nAround both presidents swirled accusations of abuse of power and obstruction of justice. Possibly the biggest difference of all, said CBS News chief Washington correspondent Major Garrett, is that Nixon resigned before the House passed any articles of impeachment; Mr. Trump will not.\nShortly before President Nixon resigned, CBS News' Walter Cronkite said all of Washington anticipated the final act of the Watergate drama: \"He is quitting, the ultimate victim of the Watergate scandal that destroyed his administration.\"\nIn the face of impeachment pressure now, President Trump sounds defiant and unmovable: \"They want to impeach me because it is the only way they are going to win,\" he said October 21. \"They got nothing!\"\nThe Watergate investigation began in the Senate with Democrat Sam Ervin pleading for White House cooperation. \"We stand to discuss the matter with you at your convenience,\" Ervin said.\nToday's investigation has House members passing by microphones offering partisan play-by-play. \"Things have just gone from very, very bad, to much, much worse,\" said Representative Adam Schiff, Chairman of the House Intelligence Committee leading the impeachment investigation.\nRepresentative Jim Jordan, a Republican just named to the Intelligence Committee, defended Mr. Trump, calling the investigation into the Ukraine extortion plot a \"ridiculous charade that the Democrats are putting him through \u2013 you can understand why the president's frustrated.\"\nWhen President Nixon's impeachment got to the House, more than 400 lawmakers \u2014 a bipartisan landslide \u2014 voted to authorize the inquiry, led by New Jersey's Peter Rodino.  \nThis time, the impeachment inquiry vote was plainly partisan \u2014 almost all Democrats in favor, all voting Republicans opposed.\nTwo Nixon special prosecutors, Archibald Cox and Leon Jaworski, led the initial Watergate investigations. Evidence was then submitted to Congress. To slow the probe, Nixon fired Cox, creating a debilitating political firestorm.\nHouse Democrat Adam Schiff is the lead investigator now, drawing Mr. Trump's outrage.\n\"What crooked Schiff is doing, he's a corrupt politician,\" Mr. Trump said Friday.\nNixon's impeachment focused on a politically-motivated burglary, other political espionage, and a systemic government cover-up. The story emerged over many months.\nThe current impeachment process, dealing with Ukraine and allegations of dangling military aid for perceived political favors, has moved much faster.\n\"The greatest difference is that there has been very little evidentiary work that has been done,\" said CBS News legal analyst Jonathan Turley. \"You know the Democrats are going from zero to 60 in about 100 feet.\"\nTurley also said the range of Ukraine-linked misdeeds against Mr. Trump appears smaller than the allegations that doomed Nixon. \"It appears they are going to go forward largely on the phone call and the Ukrainian controversy,\" he said. \"If they do that, it will be the narrowest impeachment in history, and they will have one of the most limited evidentiary records in history.\"\nAs far as the political implications for Democrats who are investigating a Republican president, Garrett said, \"Speed matters. If you move too quickly and the public cannot catch up with the facts you're presenting, you lose, at least you lose in terms of public opinion being moved by the evidence you present the public.\n\"Also, Democrats have a high standard to meet here. Impeachment is not 'I dislike the president'; it means the president has done something, or will continue to do something, that's a threat to the administration of the office as we understand it. That's a high bar.\n\"The evidence has to be presented, the public has to see it and evaluate it, before you can move. Democrats at this pace seem to be moving that process much more rapidly than at least previous impeachments have.\"\n"

        "title": "Trump Twists Impeachment Polls",
        "text": "A number of national polls show more Americans want President Donald Trump impeached and removed from office than those who don't. In swing states, however, a majority opposes removing Trump from office via impeachment, even as a majority supports moving forward with the impeachment inquiry.\n\nThose are the polling statistics that Trump twisted over the weekend when he accused the media of \"reading the wrong polls\" and said that \"people don't want anything to do with impeachment.\"\n\nIn remarks to the press on Nov. 2 and Nov. 3, Trump tried to keep the focus not on national polling, but more narrowly on only polls in swing states.\n\nTrump, Nov. 2: If you look at what's happening, if you look at the poll numbers, if you look at the poll numbers in the swing states, they're saying, \"Don't do this. Don't do it.\"\n\nTrump, Nov. 3: The impeachment polls have been very, very strong \u2014 and especially in the swing states, I think you see that.  The swing states \u2014 they don't want to hear about it.  And we have polls \u2014 people don't want to hear about impeachment. The only one that wants impeachment \u2014 to talk about it \u2014 is the fake media and the Democrats, who \u2014 basically, they work for the media\n\nWhen Trump says the public polled in swing states is saying, \"Don't do it,\" that depends on if \"it\" means moving forward with the impeachment inquiry, or impeaching and removing Trump from office.\n\nAccording to a New York Times/Siena College poll released on Oct. 30, majorities in six battleground states \u2014 Arizona, Florida, Michigan, North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin \u2014 oppose impeaching and removing Trump (52%-44%). (The battleground poll has a margin of error of 1.7 percentage points.) A Trump campaign official seized on those findings, telling The Hill that while large percentages in Democratic states like New York and California support impeachment, \"in these states where the election is really going to be fought, we're seeing that voters oppose impeachment, and there's an intensity to that opposition.\"\n\nWilliam Galston, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, wrote about the divergence between national and swing-state opinion, noting, \"As we know, presidential elections are made in the electoral college on a state-by-state basis \u2026 which is why it is important to look at public opinion by state.\"\n\nNotably, though, that same poll shows that while a majority does not support removing Trump via impeachment, about the same percentage, 51%, supports the impeachment inquiry being conducted by the House (44% oppose it). That contradicts Trump's claim that most \"don't want to hear about it\" and don't want to \"talk about it.\"\n\nDemocrats have acknowledged that public sentiment is a key part of the impeachment process.\n\n\"Public opinion is everything,\" Rep. Terri Sewell said on NBC's \"Meet the Press\" on Nov. 3. \"Speaker Pelosi often quotes Thomas Jefferson, that it's all about public sentiment. So having said that, I think it's really important that we present in a deliberate fashion.\"\n\nNationally, public sentiment is more pro-impeachment than it is in just swing states. According to the Real Clear Politics average of recent polls, a plurality of voters, 48.1%, support impeachment and removing Trump, while 44.9% do not. That's an average of many polls, including recent polls from NBC News/Wall Street Journal, ABC News/Washington Post, Fox News, Economist/YouGov, Politico/Morning Consult, USA Today/Suffolk, Grinnell College/Selzer, Quinnipiac and CNN.\n\nA slightly larger percentage, 50.9%, supports the House moving forward with an impeachment inquiry (42.3% oppose).\n\nThe FiveThirtyEight impeachment poll tracker reports similar results: 50.4% support beginning the impeachment process, while 41.2% do not; and 48.1% say Trump should be impeached or impeached and removed, while 44.6% don't support that.\n\nThose national polling figures got lost in comments Trump made to reporters on Nov. 3, when a reporter asked \u2014 correctly \u2014 about the fact that \"according to several recent polls, more Americans want you to be impeached and removed from office than the number of Americans who don't.\"\n\n\"Well, you're reading the wrong polls,\" Trump responded.  \"You're reading the wrong polls.\"\n\nThe reporter, again rightly, noted that included polls conducted by Fox News, the NBC/Wall Street Journal and ABC/Washington Post.\n\n\"Let me just tell you, I have the real polls,\" Trump said. \"The CNN polls are fake. The Fox polls have always been lousy. I tell them they ought to get themselves a new pollster. But the real polls \u2014 if you look at polls that came out this morning \u2014 people don't want anything to do with impeachment.\"\n\nWe reached out to the White House to find out what polls Trump was referring to, and whether that was from internal polling, but we did not receive a response. Perhaps the Trump reelection campaign has internal polls that show something different. But the majority of national public polls do not support Trump's claim that \"people don't want anything to do with impeachment.\"\n\nOn CNN's \"State of the Union,\" Democratic Rep. Jim Clyburn was asked about House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's comment to the Washington Post back in March. \"Impeachment is so divisive to the country that unless there's something so compelling and overwhelming and bipartisan, I don't think we should go down that path, because it divides the country,\" Pelosi said.\n\nCNN's Dana Bash noted that the House this week passed a resolution to approve procedures on impeachment, but got not a single Republican vote.\n\nClyburn said \"when we talk about bipartisan support, we are not limiting that to the Congress. I have been watching the polls all over the country. There is rising support within Republican voters in favor of moving forward. Independents seem to be \u2014 a majority of them seem to be in favor of moving forward, and certainly overwhelmingly Democrats.\"\n\nAccording to the Real Clear Politics average of recent polls, just 12% of Republicans support the impeachment inquiry, while 83.2% oppose it. Among independents, 46.8% support an impeachment inquiry, while 38% oppose it. So, a plurality of independents support it, but not a \"majority,\" as Clyburn said. Among Democrats, 84.8% support an impeachment inquiry, and 8.8% oppose it."

        "text": "Introducing a new political attack line on House Democrats amid their ongoing impeachment inquiry, President Trump forcefully declared at a rally Thursday night on friendly turf in Louisiana, \"We did nothing wrong -- and they're doing nothing.\"\nHours earlier, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi accused the president of \"bribery\" by allegedly \"threatening to withhold military aid\" in exchange for an \"investigation into his political rival\" -- signaling that Democrats were preparing to go all-in on impeachment, even as the Trump administration was touting its successes on unemployment and energy independence. The Washington Post had reported Democrats were retiring the \"quid pro quo\" language in exchange for \"bribery\" following an internal study showing the word \"bribery\" resonated more in battleground states.\nAlthough the Louisiana rally ostensibly was an effort to oust the state's governor, a Democrat, in this weekend's election, Trump almost immediately turned his attention to the first public hearings in the impeachment inquiry earlier in the week, reading from an article from The Daily Wire's Ryan Saavedra.\nSaavedra reported that a top Ukrainian official said Thursday that U.S. Ambassador Gordon Sondland \"did not link financial military assistance to a request for Ukraine to open up an investigation into former vice president and current Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden and his son, Hunter Biden.\"\nSondland, a key witness in Democrats' impeachment inquiry, has testified that Trump explicitly told him there were \"no quid pro quos of any kind\" with Ukraine, including one in which military aid would be conditioned on any politically motivated investigations. (Sondland later amended his testimony, claiming his recollection had been \"refreshed,\" to say that he had come to \"understand\" from other sources that Trump wanted Ukraine to issue an \"anti-corruption statement.\")\n\"First it was the Russia hoax -- then it was the Mueller witch hunt,\" Trump said, referencing the former special counsel, to sustained boos. \"We've been going through this from before the election took place. A bunch of bad people, and then, one of the single greatest lies ever told by anybody in this government. ... and now the absolutely crazed lunatics, the Democrats, the radical left, and their media partners standing right back there, are pushing the deranged impeachment witch hunt, for doing nothing wrong. We did nothing wrong -- and they're doing nothing.\"\nThe president argued that Democrats were holding up a vote on his newly negotiated United States\u2013Mexico\u2013Canada Agreement [USMCA] trade deal so they could handle impeachment-related matters. Pelosi promised Thursday that a vote on USMCA was \"imminent,\" but other House Democrats contradicted her later in the day, saying a vote was \"close\" but not quite that close.\nSeparately, Trump called the diplomats who have testified thus far in the impeachment probe \"Never Trumpers,\" echoing GOP claims that the unelected bureaucrats simply were frustrated that the president was asserting his constitutional authority over foreign policy, and sidelining their agenda."

        "text": "In Louisiana, incumbent Governor John Bel Edwards will be trying to defend his position as the only Democratic governor in the Deep South in the election runoff Saturday night. Republican Eddie Rispone helped force a runoff after getting enough votes in October's jungle primary to keep Edwards 3 percentage points short of 50%. Under a jungle primary, if no candidate wins 50%, the top two candidates, regardless of party, face a runoff.\n\nPresident Trump has taken an interest in the race, appearing with Rispone in Bossier City, Louisiana, on Thursday \u2014 his third time in the state in the past two months. Mr. Trump also rallied earlier this month with incumbent Republican Governor Matt Bevin in Kentucky, who conceded his race to Steve Beshear Thursday. The president enjoys substantial popularity in Louisiana, a state he won by 20 points in 2016. \n\nOn Thursday, the president presented the Louisiana election as a chance to send a message \"to the corrupt Democrats in Washington.\"\n\n\"They are corrupt, they are crazy, crazy, they are crazy, that you're not going to let them destroy our country and rob your children of their future,\" he said. \"By supporting Eddie, you will deliver a powerful rebuke to the socialists trying to sabotage our democracy and to erase your cherished way of life in Louisiana.\"\n\nDuring a Thursday call with reporters, Republican National Committee spokesperson Sebastian Gorka said the RNC has funneled $2 million into the race and that \"the reason we have an election on Saturday is because the president went down there and held Governor Edwards under 50 percent. So we're in it to win.\"\n\nRepublicans and Rispone have invoked Mr. Trump's name in most of their messaging during this race. Rispone communications director Anthony Ramirez said, \"Eddie often says he wants to do for Louisiana what Donald Trump has done for America: create jobs and grow our economy.\"\n\nIn one of his final stump speeches Friday, Rispone criticized the state's economic performance under Edwards and praised the president.\n\n\"That is amazing what he's done for Louisiana. He really loves Louisiana. He's got a special spot in his heart for us,\" Rispone said at his final Shreveport stop on the campaign trail Friday. \"\u2026it's time for a change. We can be number one in the south when it comes to jobs and opportunity.\"\n\nEdwards is the only incumbent Democratic governor up for reelection this year, after winning in 2015 with 56% of the vote compared to GOP Senator David Vitter's 44%. On the trail, he's kept the focus on state issues such as education, Medicaid expansion and bringing the state into a budget surplus \u2014 all things that his messaging suggests Rispone would roll back.\n\n\"If Eddie Rispone is elected, we risk losing all the progress that we made, like increased funding for our classrooms, TOPS scholarships, pay raises for teachers, and more funding for early childhood education. Rispone would drag us back to the days of Jindal. And we're not going back,\" an ad released on Tuesday says.\n\nThe state-focused approach is one that the Democratic Governors Association is heralding after Democrat Andy Beshear's campaign proved successful in Kentucky. Chairman of the state's Legislative Black Caucus Randal Gaines, a Democrat, pointed to the hyper-partisan and nationalized approach deployed by Republicans as another reason Rispone will be defeated.\n\n\"The Republicans on the national and state level are basically advocating a partisan agenda. That the citizens should go out and vote for Rispone not because he had a demonstrated record of running a government, not because he has a track record of having done anything to advance Louisiana\u2026 because there is no record of that. It's only because he's a Republican. And that's not enough for this state,\" Gaines said. \n\nThe Democratic and Republican Governors Associations have collectively poured close to $7 million in runoff advertisements, which have recently focused on local spats. Democrats are harping on Rispone's comments that Edwards, a West Point grad, \"hurt the reputation\" of the academy. Republicans are criticizing Edwards for the state's high car insurance, as well as how he handled flooding in the state in 2016. \n\nWhile the latest Morning Consult poll shows Edwards with a decent approval rating of 52 percent, he is still facing a toss-up race. He's tried to set himself apart from the image of national Democrats portrayed by Republicans, especially in a historically conservative state that was overwhelmingly pro-Trump in 2016.    \n\nAt the last debate, Rispone brought up his opponent's vote as a superdelegate for Hillary Clinton in 2016 in an attempt to tie Edwards to Washington Democrats. Edwards responded to this and made clear he doesn't want to involve any talk from Washington D.C.\n\n\"There ya go, you're always looking to Washington D.C. There's not much inspiration to be had there. The dysfunction that has gripped our nation's capital has prevented [them] from doing anything meaningful to tackle our nation's biggest challenges,\" Edwards said. \n\n\"Well, you ignored the question again.. the truth of the matter is you're gonna support whoever wacko that they get again to run against Donald Trump, who wants to do away with planes, trains and cows,\" Rispone retorted. \n\nThe runoff's early election period brought in the highest early-voting turnout for a non-Presidential election, according to the office of Louisiana's secretary of state. In a welcome sign for Democrats and Governor Edwards, his pivotal African-American turnout increased substantially compared to the primary early vote.\n\n\"One thing that led to surge of voting\u2026 is many Democrats in the state assumed he would win the race, they were confident he would win. Sometimes when there's confidence, there's less of a sense of urgency. Once he didn't win in the primary, the broad support that he has in this state basically became energized, and a sense of urgency rose,\" Gaines said. \n\nStill, Louisiana political consultant Mary Patricia Wray said Edwards has to continue to turn out metro-suburban white moderates if he wants to win, a similar demographic that helped secure a win for Beshear in Kentucky.\n\n\"Just like conservatives south of Cincinnati had permission to go Democrat in the Kentucky race, so now do conservatives need permission to vote for John Bel Edwards. They had a clear permission slip in 2015 against Vitter,\" Wray told CBS News.\n\nDespite Bevin's defeat in Kentucky, the Republican Governors Association dismissed any comparisons between Kentucky and Louisiana and said it would not alter its strategy. \n\nBoth sides are expecting a very close race: the latest Mason-Dixon poll shows Edwards with a slight 2-point lead. \n\n\"This race is going to come down to turnout. The polls all show a tie or statistical tie within the margin of error. It's a tie ballgame and it's going to be about who gets their players on the field,\" said Republican Governors Association spokesperson Amelia Chass\u00e9 Alcivar. "

It protects eligible immigrant youth who entered the U.S. with their parents or guardians but have grown up in the country and known it as their only home.\nThe program expires every two years and must be renewed, which President Donald Trump has opposed.\nThe Supreme Court will have the fate of about 660,000 others in its hands Tuesday when it considers the Trump administration's decision to end DACA. A ruling on the DACA program is expected next spring in the midst of the 2020 presidential election.\nAn estimated 25,000 DACA recipients \u2014 often referred to as \"Dreamers'' \u2014 are living in Arizona.\nTrump has said it should be up to Congress to enact legislation to make the policy permanent, which he has yet to do.\nOn the eve of the Supreme Court taking up the case, a small group of DACA recipients and their supporters gathered outside the state Capitol in Phoenix, offering prayers and support to Dreamers who fear a change in policy could lead to deportation.\nLinda Bates said she knows one young man who she has mentored who was born in the U.S. but fears his siblings who were brought here as small children may be forced to leave.\n\"He's very worried, even though he's from here and he's an American citizen, that if anything happens to his older brother and sister, the whole family will have to leave,'' Bates said. \"And he was born here, this is all he knows, he doesn't know anything about Mexico. So he feels very strongly that we are failing him because he didn't expect this was going to happen to him. He's wondering if it was worth going to school, getting his diploma.''"

On top of that, that person would be hit with a 6 percent wealth tax, or an additional $60. The result: taxes as high as $95 on income of $60 for a combined tax rate of 158 percent, according to the Journal.\n\nGET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE\n\n\"If you raise tax rates so high that you start raising less revenue because people work less, they save less, they hide their money more, then there's more tax evasion, then it might be counterproductive,\" George Yin, a professor emeritus of law and taxation at the University of Virginia School of Law, told FOX Business.

Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., reacts during a meeting at Broughton High School in Raleigh, NC Thursday, Nov. 7, 2019.

Bernie Sanders, has introduced a cadre of similar tax proposals, including a wealth tax that ranges from a 1 percent levy on couples worth $32 million to 8 percent on couples worth more than $10 billion."

        "text": "Donald Trump Jr ventured on to the University of California's overwhelmingly liberal Los Angeles campus on Sunday, hoping to prove what he had just argued in his book \u2013 that a hate-filled American left was hell-bent on silencing him and anyone else who supported the Trump presidency.\nBut the appearance backfired when his own supporters, diehard Make America Great Again conservatives, raised their voices most loudly in protest and ended up drowning him out barely 20 minutes into an event scheduled to last two hours.\nThe audience was angry that Trump Jr and his girlfriend, Kimberly Guilfoyle, would not take questions. The loud shouts of \"USA! USA!\" that greeted Trump when he first appeared on the stage of a university lecture hall to promote his book Triggered: How The Left Thrives on Hate and Wants to Silence Us quickly morphed into even louder, openly hostile chants of \"Q and A! Q and A!\"\nThe 450-strong audience had just been told they would not be allowed to ask questions, \"due to time constraints\".\nAt first, Trump and Guilfoyle tried to ignore the discontent, which originated with a fringe group of America Firsters who believe the Trump administration has been taken captive by a cabal of internationalists, free-traders, and apologists for mass immigration.\nWhen the shouting would not subside, Trump Jr tried \u2013 and failed \u2013 to argue that taking questions from the floor risked creating soundbites that leftwing social media posters would abuse and distort. Nobody was buying that.\nIn minutes, the entire argument put forward by the president's son \u2013 that he was willing to engage in dialogue but that it was the left that refused to tolerate free speech \u2013 crumbled.\n\"I'm willing to listen\u2026\" Trump began.\n\"Q and A! Q and A!\" the audience yelled back.\n\"We'll go into the lion's den and talk \u2026\" Trump tried again.\n\"Then open the Q and A!\" came the immediate response.\nGuilfoyle, forced to shout to make herself heard, told students in the crowd: \"You're not making your parents proud by being rude and disruptive.\"\nShe and Trump Jr left the stage moments later.\nThe fiasco pointed to a factional rift on the Trump-supporting conservative right that has been growing rapidly in recent weeks, particularly among \"zoomers\" \u2013 student-age activists. On one side are one of the sponsors of Trump Jr's book tour, Turning Point USA, a campus conservative group with a track record of bringing provocative rightwing speakers to liberal universities.\nOn the other side are far-right activists \u2013 often referred to as white supremacists and neo-Nazis, although many of them reject such labels \u2013 who believe in slamming the door on all immigrants, not just those who cross the border without documents, and who want an end to America's military and diplomatic engagement with the wider world.\nA number of the loudest voices at Sunday's event were supporters of Nick Fuentes, a 21-year-old activist with a podcast called America First that has taken particular aim at Turning Point USA and its 25-year-old founder, Charlie Kirk. In a number of his own recent campus appearances, Kirk has faced questions accusing him of being more interested in supporting Israel than in putting America first. He has responded by calling his detractors conspiracists and racists.\nOn Sunday, Kirk appeared alongside Trump Jr. and Guilfoyle but said nothing.\nTwo Fuentes supporters, delighted with the outcome of Trump Jr's appearance, later told the Guardian the pro-Trump movement was being infected with \"fake conservatism\" and that the president himself was at the mercy of a cabal of deep state operatives who wouldn't let him do many of the things he campaigned on.\nThe pair, who called themselves Joe and Orion Miles, said: \"It was an absolute disaster for them. We wanted to ask questions about immigration and about Christianity, but they didn't want to face those questions.\"\nAlso, if Trump Jr was expecting a small army of \"triggered\" leftwingers to clamour for his silence, he did not get it. No more than 35 protesters showed up and, despite making a lot of noise with drums and whistles and shouts of \"Trump-Pence Out Now!\", resisted taunts and insults from provocateurs in Make America Great Again hats from across a line of metal barriers.\nI hope you appreciated this article. Before you move on, I was hoping you would consider taking the step of supporting the Guardian's journalism. \nFrom Elon Musk to Rupert Murdoch, a small number of billionaire owners have a powerful hold on so much of the information that reaches the public about what's happening in the world. The Guardian is different. We have no billionaire owner or shareholders to consider. Our journalism is produced to serve the public interest \u2013 not profit motives.\nAnd we avoid the trap that befalls much US media \u2013 the tendency, born of a desire to please all sides, to engage in false equivalence in the name of neutrality. While fairness guides everything we do, we know there is a right and a wrong position in the fight against racism and for reproductive justice. When we report on issues like the climate crisis, we're not afraid to name who is responsible. And as a global news organization, we're able to provide a fresh, outsider perspective on US politics \u2013 one so often missing from the insular American media bubble. \nAround the world, readers can access the Guardian's paywall-free journalism because of our unique reader-supported model. That's because of people like you. Our readers keep us independent, beholden to no outside influence and accessible to everyone \u2013 whether they can afford to pay for news, or not.\n"

On Friday, the White House released a rough transcript of the call that conflicts with a separate summary of the call sent to reporters in April.\n\nThe April summary of the call said that Trump \"underscored the unwavering support of the United States for Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity \u2013 within its internationally recognized borders \u2013 and expressed his commitment to work together with President-elect Zelensky and the Ukrainian people to implement reforms that strengthen democracy, increase prosperity, and root out corruption.\"\n\nThe rough transcript of the phone call documents Trump congratulating Zelensky on his election victory and pledging to send a \"very, very high level representative\" to attend Zelensky's inauguration. However, it does not include Trump explicitly promising to work with Zelensky to \"strengthen democracy, increase prosperity, and root out corruption\" in Ukraine.\n\nIn response to questions from reporters, the White House said in a Friday statement that \"the NSC's Ukraine expert\" prepared the April summary.\n\n\"The president continues to push for transparency in light of these baseless accusations and has taken the unprecedented steps to release the transcripts of both phone calls with President Zelensky so that every American can see he did nothing wrong. It is standard operating procedure for the National Security Council to provide readouts of the president's phone calls with foreign leaders,\" deputy White House press secretary Hogan Gidley said.\n\n\"This one was prepared by the NSC's Ukraine expert,\" he added, an apparent reference to Vindman.\n\nThe April 21 phone call happened three months before a July 25 phone call between the two world leaders that is now at the center of House Democrats' impeachment effort against Trump. Lawmakers are investigating allegations that Trump withheld military aid from Ukraine to secure an investigation into former Vice President Joe Biden, which could give him political advantage over the 2020 Democratic front-runner.\n\nVindman, who has already provided a closed-door deposition in the impeachment process, is set to testify in a public hearing on Tuesday."

        "title": "Impeachment inquiry: White House releases rough transcript of Trump's earlier call with Zelensky",
        "text": "President Donald Trump released a rough transcript Friday of his first conversation with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and was quickly confronted with questions about why it departed from an initial description of that April conversation. \nAbsent from the call was any discussion of corruption in Ukraine, which Trump and his allies have said was at the heart of the president's requests for investigations. A brief summary of the same call released by the White House in April claimed Trump \"expressed his commitment\" to strengthen democracy and \"root out corruption.\"\nThe largely congratulatory phone call was placed months before a second, ill-fated conversation between the two leaders in July that became the focus of the House Democrats' impeachment inquiry. Trump described Zelensky's election as \"fantastic\" and \"incredible\" in the April call and drew comparisons to his own success in 2016.\nTrump and his allies argued the summary of the April call would counter allegations from Democrats that he abused the power of his office by pressuring Zelensky to dig up dirt on a political opponent and held up aid to the country as leverage. While the call contained no reference to the investigations, it also lacked key details included in an initial summary the White House released shorty after the call wrapped up. \nThe April 21 summary of the call said that Trump \"underscored the unwavering support of the United States for Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity\" and that he expressed his commitment to work with Zelensky \"to implement reforms that strengthen democracy, increase prosperity, and root out corruption.\"\nBut in the rough transcript of the call made public Friday, there was no mention of corruption or of Russia's incursion into Ukraine's \"territorial integrity.\"\nWhite House spokesman Hogan Gidley did not explain the discrepancy between the two summaries but said in a statement that the initial readout \"was prepared by the NSC's Ukraine expert.\" That appeared to be a reference to Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman, a Ukraine expert at the National Security Council. Vindman is set to testify Tuesday.\nTrump invited Zelensky to the White House during the April call, an invitation that would later be tied to requests to investigate the son of former Vice President Joe Biden and the 2016 election. \n\"When you're settled in and ready, I'd like to invite you to the White House,\" Trump told Zelensky. \"We'll have a lot of things to talk about, but we're with you all the way.\"  \nThe day's top stories, from sports to movies to politics to world events.\nDuring the 16-minute call, which took place as he was aboard Air Force One returning from his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida, Trump compared Zelensky's election to his own. Trump is a former reality show host; Zelensky a former comedian.\n\"And it's really an amazing thing that you've done,\" Trump said. \"I guess, in a way, I did something similar.\"\nMore:How to stay updated on USA TODAY's impeachment coverage\nThe president told Zelensky that, when he owned the Miss Universe organization, the Ukrainians \"always had great people.\" \nTrump and his allies framed the call as evidence of his innocence against allegations from Democrats that he abused the power of his office.  \n\"The president took the unprecedented steps to declassify and release the transcripts of both of his phone calls with President Zelensky so that every American can see he did nothing wrong,\" said White House press secretary Stephanie Grisham.\nAt the time of Trump's first call to Zelensky, Biden had not formally announced his candidacy for president. He would do so four days later, on April 25. \nTrump took the unusual step in September of releasing a summary of a July 25 call with the Ukrainian president at the center of a whistleblower's complaint that alleged the president pressured Ukraine about Biden. The whistleblower complaint sparked House Democrats to open an impeachment inquiry into whether Trump abused the power of his office by withholding $400 million in financial aid approved by Congress to Ukraine as a way to force the country to chip in with investigations of a political opponent.  \nTrump maintains his July call was \"perfect\" and has repeatedly attacked the impeachment investigation as \"a hoax\" and a \"witch hunt.\" \nThe summary of the call comes as the impeachment inquiry has entered a new, public phase, featuring testimony from witnesses who have already been interviewed in private depositions. Several witnesses have corroborated the whistleblower's report, testifying they believed the decision to withhold Ukraine's security aid was linked to whether Kiev would pursue investigations into Trump's political rivals. \nRevelations from the closed-door hearings also showed Trump's personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani had been running a months-long shadow foreign policy campaign on Ukraine to pressure Kiev to open investigations that would benefit the U.S. president politically ahead of the 2020 election. \nBehind closed doors: Read all the transcripts from the testimony in the Trump impeachment inquiry\nExplainer:Biden, allies pushed out Ukrainian prosecutor because he didn't pursue corruption cases\nLt. Col. Alexander Vindman, a National Security Council expert on Ukraine who listened in on both the April and July calls, testified to lawmakers that withholding aid undermined U.S. national security. He told impeachment investigators that it was clear that Ukraine had to deliver specific investigations in order to secure a much coveted White House meeting with Trump. \nBut Vindman also described Trump's earlier call in April with his Ukrainian counterpart as \"positive\" and that Trump \"expressed his desire to work with President Zelensky and extended an invitation to the White House.\" \n"

        "text": "Former President Jimmy Carter has been admitted to Emory University Hospital to have a procedure done that will relieve the pressure on his brain caused by bleeding from his recent falls, The Carter Center announced Monday.\nThe procedure has been scheduled for Tuesday morning.\n\"President Carter is resting comfortably, and his wife, Rosalynn, is with him,\" The Carter Center statement said.\nOn Oct. 21, Carter fell at his home in Plains, Georgia. He was admitted to Phoebe Sumter Medical Center in Americus for observation and treatment of a minor pelvic fracture, said Deanna Congileo, director of communications with the Carter Center.\n\"He is in good spirits and is looking forward to recovering at home,\" she said.\nIn May, Carter fell and broke his hip at his home while getting ready to go on a turkey hunt. Carter underwent successful surgery to repair the hip and recovered at the medical center, according to the Carter Center.\nHe fell again Oct. 6 while getting ready for church and had to get 14 stitches above his brow. The Carter Center issued a statement afterward saying Carter felt fine and would be ready to attend an opening ceremony for Habitat for Humanity's Jimmy and Rosalynn Carter Work Project in Nashville, Tennessee, that night.\nCarter turned 95 on Oct. 1, officially becoming the oldest living ex-president on March 21, surpassing George H.W. Bush, who died in November. Prior to Bush, previous record holders were Gerald Ford, Ronald Reagan, Herbert Hoover and John Adams.\nCarter was diagnosed with cancer in August 2015 at age 91 after having surgery to remove a lesion on his liver. After the surgery, Carter announced the cancer had spread to other parts of his body. Doctors had found melanoma lesions on his brain. He announced that he would significantly cut back on his schedule while undergoing treatment.\nIn November of that year, the Carter Center issued an update on the former president's health, saying he had received good news from his doctors. Recent tests had shown there was no new evidence of malignancy and he was responding well to treatment. In March 2016, he announced to his Sunday school class at Maranatha Baptist Church of Plains that he was cleared of the disease.\nCarter was elected president in 1976 at age 52. He has been out of office for more than 38 years, losing a re-election bid in a landslide loss to Ronald Reagan in 1980. He has since become one of the most active ex-presidents in U.S. history, founding The Carter Center and the Jimmy Carter Presidential Library and Museum, and continuing to participate in frequent Habitat for Humanity homebuilding efforts.\nCarter was born in Plains, a tiny town in southwest Georgia. He graduated from the U.S. Naval Academy in 1946 and married Rosalynn Smith.\nAfter his service with the Navy, Carter returned to Plains in 1962 where he and Rosalynn operated a seed and farm supply company, according to The Jimmy Carter Presidential Library. In 1962, the Democratic candidate entered politics and was elected to the Georgia State Senate. In 1966, he lost his first bid for the governorship, but won in a second shot at the seat in 1970.\nIn 1976 his long-shot presidential bid won him the White House when Carter defeated incumbent Ford to become the 39th president of the United States.\nCarter's presidency is known for various historic milestones, such as the Camp David Peace Accords between Israel and Egypt in 1978 and establishing diplomatic relations with China, his library noted. He also was responsible for the creation of the departments of Education and Energy, as well as implementing new environmental protection legislation such as the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act, the library said.\nHe famously failed to win re-election in 1980 during a sluggish economy and the Iranian hostage crisis. After more than a year in captivity, the hostages were released the same day Republican Reagan was sworn into office \u2014 Jan. 20, 1981.\nCarter managed to repair his image over the last several decades through his work helping the less fortunate. In 1982, he founded The Carter Center, which works to address national and international issues through public policy. The nonprofit organization has dispatched 100 election observers to countries in the Americas, Africa and Asia.\nTo younger generations, Carter is probably best known for his work with Habitat For Humanity, a nonprofit that works to provide housing to less fortunate citizens. The author of several books, Carter also continued in his mission to engage in international diplomacy and advancing human rights around the world. He also worked to promote democracy, prevent diseases and ensure secure and fair elections in developing countries.\nIn recent years, Carter also spoke out against anti-gay and rising racist sentiment. In 2000, he announced he would be leaving the Southern Baptist Convention due to the body's literal interpretation of the Bible, a move the New York Times said was mostly symbolic because he didn't serve in an official capacity with the organization. In 2015, he told the Huffington Post he believed Jesus would be in favor of marriage equality. In 2016, he told the Times Republican criticism of former President Barack Obama had \"heavy\" racial overtones and then Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump's successful campaign \"tapped a waiting reservoir there of inherent racism.\"\nIn recent weeks, Carter has stepped up his criticism of Trump. Last month, Carter addressed a crowd at the Carter Center and said while he doesn't know which Democrat he will support in 2020, a major factor in his decision will be which candidate can unseat Trump, \"because I think it would be a disaster to have four more years of Trump,\" he said.\nCarter also said he could not have undertaken the duties of a president when he was 80, according to Fox News.\n\"If I were just 80 years old, if I was 15 years younger, I don't believe I could undertake the duties I experienced when I was president,\" he said.\nCarter said he voted for Bernie Sanders in the last Democratic presidential primary.\nIn June, Carter called Trump an \"illegitimate\" president while participating in a C-SPAN panel on human rights in Washington, D.C., along with his vice president, Walter Mondale. Carter said Trump won the 2016 presidential election because of Russian interference, despite the fact several congressional and judicial inquiries and investigations have uncovered no substantive evidence that Trump colluded with Russian agents to discredit Democrat Hillary Clinton's campaign.\n"

Devin Nunes, who is the top Republican on the intelligence panel, sent a witness list to Schiff that included Hunter Biden as well as the anonymous whistleblower, whose complaint about a July 25 phone call between President Trump and Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky launched the impeachment proceedings.\nTrump asked Zelensky on the call to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden's effort to oust a Ukraine prosecutor who was targeting the Burisma Holdings gas company, which employed Hunter Biden for a hefty salary.\nTrump also wanted Zelensky to investigate allegations the Democratic National Committee was working with Ukraine officials in 2016 to find information that would be damaging to the Trump presidential campaign.\nRepublicans want to showcase witnesses who would back up Trump's concerns about Democratic election interference and Ukrainian corruption and, in particular, why Hunter Biden won a seat on the gas company board despite having no experience.\nThe GOP list includes Ambassador Kurt Volker, who served as a special envoy to Ukraine. Nunes has requested Volker to serve on the same panel as Taylor.\nRepublicans also want to hear from David Hale, the undersecretary of state for political affairs, and Tim Morrison, senior director for European and Russian Affairs on the National Security Council.\nMorrison said in closed-door testimony that he did not believe Trump did anything wrong in his July 25 conversation with Zelensky.\nSchiff is more likely to allow the GOP to call Volker, Hale, and Morrison.\n"

        "text": " The prospect of Michael Bloomberg jumping into the 2020 Democratic fray is alarming supporters of Joe Biden, who see the former vice president's decades-long Oval Office quest getting upended by the billionaire businessman's open wallet.\n\n\"I pray to God, every night, that this won't hurt Biden,\" said Peggy Bell, 85, at a Saturday campaign event for the 36-year Delaware senator. \"I don't think he's weak, it depends on where the polls are from. I've followed him for years. Look at what he did with Barack [Obama]. Bloomberg has nothing in comparison to that.\"\n\n\nBloomberg's looming presidential candidacy is effectively a vote of no confidence in Biden's chances, amid slipping poll numbers and slack fundraising. Bloomberg, New York City mayor for 12 years starting in 2002, would reportedly spend \"whatever it takes\" to win the Democratic nomination and fall 2020 fight against President Trump. With an estimated net worth of $53 billion, Bloomberg expects that he can ignore the first four primary states and instead flood airwaves with advertisements in hopes of scoring a series of wins on Super Tuesday, March 3, when more than a dozen states and entities vote.\n\nRecent polling shows Biden's support among Democratic voters precipitously falling in early nominating contests such as Iowa and New Hampshire. His campaign has all but conceded it may not see a win until South Carolina, the fourth state to vote in the Democratic primary season. That strategy has been criticized as untenable by a number of Democratic strategists, particularly as his campaign runs short on cash.\n\nAt the end of the last quarter, Biden's campaign had just under $9 million in the bank with a burn rate that many Democrats found unsustainable. Sens. Bernie Sanders of Vermont and Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, the two other Democratic front-runners, ended the quarter with $33.7 million and $25.7 million, respectively.\n\n\nBloomberg, 77, has not declared his candidacy, but filing to run in Alabama's primary on Super Tuesday is a strong indication he's leaning toward doing so. New Hampshire's own filing deadline is Friday.\n\nBiden, 76, on Friday, greeted news of Bloomberg's likely entry politely, telling reporters, \"I welcome him in the race. Michael's a solid guy. So, let's see where this goes.\"\n\nSupporters of Biden, making his third presidential run after flops in the 1988 cycle and 2008 race, weren't as magnanimous about Bloomberg's White House ambitions.\n\nBloomberg has \"already said he's not going to be campaigning in New Hampshire, so we're deeply insulted,\" Steve Root, 70, a securities lawyer, told the Washington Examiner. \"This whole thing seems like Ross Perot to me, but I guess a lot of people think Joe can't get over the finish line.\"\n\nEric Boyer, 40, a self-described moderate Democrat and a political science professor at Colby-Sawyer College, was skeptical of Bloomberg's chances.\n\n\"I don't see a path to the nomination,\" Boyer told the Washington Examiner. \"It just doesn't seem like the moderate lane needs another candidate.\"\n\nSome Democrats, despite being ardent Biden supporters, sounded more like backers of Sanders, a socialist, or Warren, 70, running as a left-wing populist, in blasting a potential Bloomberg run.\n\n\"We don't need any more billionaires,\" Steven Foster, 60, a musician who has committed himself to Biden, told the Washington Examiner. \"He thinks he's going to outshine Biden? Biden has way more experience. You need someone who is going to be strong. We already have a billionaire in the White House and look what's going on now.\"\n\n\nThat view echoes comments by Sanders, 78 on Sunday, who labeled Bloomberg's presidential aspirations \"the arrogance of billionaires\" and accused the entrepreneur-turned-mayor of trying to buy the election.\n\nBut the fretting over Bloomberg's chances may be premature.\n\nA MorningConsult poll released Sunday morning found only 4% of Democratic voters nationwide support his candidacy, while nearly 25% of likely primary voters view him unfavorably. That's unfavorable rate is higher than any other Democrat running."

Mr. Trump and the first lady also participated in a wreath-laying ceremony in Madison Square Park.\n\"To each veteran of the war, the glory of your deeds will only grow greater with time,\" Mr. Trump said. \"This city is graced with your presence. This nation is forever in your debt and we thank you all.\" \nHe noted the presence of veterans from World War II, the Korean War, the Vietnam War, the Gulf War and the war on terror. \n\"You are the reason our hearts swell with pride, our foes tremble with fear, and our nation thrives in freedom.\"  \nThis year, the parade honors the nation's Marines.

Democrats are trying to stay narrow and focused, keeping the story simple. Republicans want the opposite \u2013 bringing in as many characters and events as possible and arguing that while Trump may have acted inappropriately, his actions are far from impeachable and are no different from business as usual in Washington.\n\nTrump, meanwhile, urged Republicans to say his actions were not just \"not impeachable\" but \"PERFECT.\"\n\nBoth parties' dueling game plans were in sharp relief Sunday on the morning talk shows.\n\n\"This is a very simple, straightforward act. The president broke the law,\" Democratic Rep. Jackie Speier of California said on ABC News' \"This Week.\" \"He went on a telephone call with the president of Ukraine and . . . proceeded to ask for an investigation of his rival.\" She said \"this is a very strong case of bribery.\"\n\nBut Republicans do not want to focus on the much-discussed July 25 phone call between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, or even on events of recent months. Instead, they are seeking to broaden the investigation to include actions taken years ago by the Bidens.\n\nOn NBC News's \"Meet the Press,\" Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., argued that \"it's unfair to treat Trump under one standard and Joe Biden under a different standard.\" He claimed that a variety of American elected officials from both parties have in recent years sought to use leverage over Ukraine to advance some kind of agenda.\n\n\"I would make the argument that every politician in Washington, other than me, virtually, is trying to manipulate Ukraine to their purposes,\" Paul said.\n\nRepublicans have sought to minimize Trump's role in the campaign to pressure Ukraine, and the list of potential witnesses they released Saturday suggests they will continue to do so.\n\nAmong those on the list are Hunter Biden, whose father is a leading Democratic candidate to challenge Trump in 2020; Hunter Biden's business partner Devon Archer; the unnamed whistleblower, whom Trump and some of his allies have campaigned to publicly identify; the researcher Nellie Ohr of Fusion GPS, which commissioned a dossier that linked Russia and Trump; and Alexandra Chalupa, a Ukrainian American who worked with the Democratic National Committee.\n\nHouse Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, D-Calif., said in a statement Saturday that Democrats would evaluate the requests but that the impeachment probe \"will not serve \u2026 as a vehicle to undertake the same sham investigations\" into the Bidens or the 2016 campaign, or to retaliate against the whistleblower.\n\nSeveral Democrats on Sunday pushed back against their GOP counterparts' request.\n\nSpeier, a member of the House Intelligence Committee, raised the issue of the \"great risk associated with (the whistleblower's) life right now.\" She said that it is unnecessary for the individual to appear before the intelligence panel because other witnesses who were actually on Trump's phone call with Zelensky will testify.\n\n\"The only thing that the whistleblower can say is that he was told by other people about the phone call,\" Speier said. \"We have the other people coming forward to actually testify. So you have direct evidence, not indirect evidence.\"\n\nSpeier argued that having Hunter Biden testify would also be \"irrelevant\" because he \"is unrelated to the Ukraine call.\" Some of the witnesses Republicans have requested may be allowed, she added, including National Security Council official Tim Morrison and former Ukraine envoy Kurt Volker, both of whom have already testified behind closed doors.\n\nAnother Democrat on the Intelligence Committee, Rep. Sean Maloney of New York, also rejected the call for Hunter Biden to testify.\n\n\"He has no knowledge of what the president did or didn't do here that is the subject of the impeachment hearing,\" Maloney said on \"Fox News Sunday.\"\n\nSome Republicans, meanwhile, focused on the process of the impeachment inquiry rather than on the substance of the allegations against Trump.\n\nRep. Mac Thornberry, R-Texas, argued on \"This Week\" that \"there will be a taint to this one-sided, partisan approach to impeachment.\"\n\nHe said it would be \"inappropriate,\" but not impeachable, for a president to ask a foreign leader to investigate a political rival, as Trump is alleged to have done. The importance of process, Thornberry maintained, cannot be ignored.\n\n\"There's a reason we let murderers and robbers and rapists go free when their due process rights have been violated,\" Thornberry said.\n\nIn a tweet later Sunday, Trump suggested that saying his actions were \"not impeachable\" is not good enough.

Republicans, don't be led into the fools trap of saying it was not perfect, but is not impeachable. No, it is much stronger than that. NOTHING WAS DONE WRONG!\"\n\nOn \"Fox News Sunday,\" Rep. Will Hurd, R-Texas, said the impeachment inquiry \"has been a partisan exercise from the very beginning.\" He said Republicans want to hear testimony from Hunter Biden.\n\n\"I think we should just turn over every rock and pursue every lead to ultimately get to the truth,\" Hurd said.\n\nHurd also argued that Schiff should be forced to testify about his office's contacts with the whistleblower, claiming that the committee chairman \"misled the American public earlier in the year about what he knew about the contact with the whistleblower.\"\n\nSchiff said in September that his committee had \"not spoken directly with the whistleblower.\" He later said he \"should have been much more clear.\"\n\nOther Republicans maintained that Trump sought to hold up much-needed military aid to Ukraine over general concerns about corruption \u2013 despite closed-door testimony from witnesses who said the White House had threatened to withdraw the aid unless Kyiv announced investigations for Trump's political benefit.\n\n\"I remain sympathetic with President Trump's legitimate concerns about the corruption,\" Sen. Ron Johnson, R-Wis., said on CNN's \"State of the Union.\" \"When you're going to provide hundreds of millions of taxpayer dollars into a system, you want to make sure it isn't corrupt. \u2026 I never heard the president say I want to dig up dirt on 2020 opponents.\""

        "text": "Republicans have no unified argument in the impeachment inquiry of Donald Trump , in large part because they can't agree on how best to defend the president \u2014 or for some, if they should.\nThat would require a level of consensus that Trump's call with the Ukraine president was \"perfect,\" as he insists. Or it would take a measure of GOP independence from Trump to suggest there may be a need to investigate.\nInstead, it's every Republican for himself or herself.\nUtah Sen. Mitt Romney says the president's actions toward Ukraine are \"troubling.\" Other Republicans say the behavior may raise concerns, but it's not impeachable.\nSouth Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham calls the whole impeachment inquiry \"B.S.\"\nThe result is a mishmash of GOP commentary spilling from Capitol Hill that may shield lawmakers, for now, from risky political choices, but leaves them with a disjointed defense of Trump as impeachment hearings push into the public realm this coming week.\n\"It's not good,\" said veteran GOP strategist Alex Conant. \"Normally you want to establish the facts, get them out on their own terms, and build a message around that strategy. They're not doing any of that.\"\nHe added: \"It's hard to rally people to your side without a coherent and sustainable message.\"\nEarly on, as the White House ceded the PR strategy to the president, Republicans in the House and Senate parted ways as they confronted the political threat posed by the Democrats' impeachment investigation.\nAs far back as mid-October, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., gathered his GOP colleagues in private and offered them advice on impeachment.\nMcConnell told Republican senators their best bet was to calibrate their own message about the impeachment inquiry to fit their political situation, according to two people familiar with the private meeting who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss the closed-door session.\nWith a Power Point presentation, McConnell outlined the process ahead if the investigation moves to a vote in the House and trial in the Senate. But when it came time to broach what Republicans should say about impeachment, McConnell showed a preference for saying as little about it as possible.\nMcConnell suggested a couple of options. Senators could say they disagreed with the House process, he said, or they could simply say that as potential jurors in an eventual impeachment trial they wouldn't discuss it, according to the people familiar with the meeting.\nIt was the kind of political advice one would expect from the risk-averse leader as he tries to insulate his 53-seat GOP majority, including several senators up for reelection in 2020 in states such as Maine and Colorado where voters are split on Trump.\n\"That's what a good leader does \u2014 gives them the flexibility they need to respond. My problem is, given how egregious the president's conduct is, he's given them a pass,\" said Jim Manley, a veteran Democratic strategist.\n\"Most of these folks have got to know that what the president's doing is wrong, but they've made a cold-hearted, political decision right now it's best to stick with the president,\" he said.\nAt its core, the impeachment inquiry is based on what Democrats say is an improper quid pro quo \u2014 a \"shakedown\" \u2014 that Trump engaged in during his July 25 phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelesnkiy.\nAccording to a White House rough transcript of the call and testimony from several government officials, Trump was withholding needed military aid the East European ally as he wanted Zelenskiy to investigate Trump's potential 2020 rival, Joe Biden, as well 2016 U.S. election interference.\nIn the House, where congressional district boundary lines have been drawn in a way that leaves Republicans barely exposed to voters with centrist or left-leaning views, GOP leaders are mounting a more fulsome, if shifting, defense of Trump.\nGOP leader Kevin McCarthy of California says the president did nothing wrong on the call with Zelenskiy, and Trump's top allies in the House, including Ohio Rep. Jim Jordan, the top Republican on a committee conducting the impeachment inquiry, are leading the daily arguments against Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., and the Democrats.\nJordan is seen as the \"chief messenger\" for Republicans, said one senior House GOP aide who was not authorized to publicly discuss the strategy and spoke on condition of anonymity.\nThe House Republican message against impeachment has four distinct parts, according to this aide: The transcript of Trump's call with Zelenskiy shows the president did nothing wrong; several key witnesses testified that they don't have firsthand knowledge of what transpired; the Ukrainians didn't know the military aid was being upheld until it was publicly reported; and eventually the U.S. agreed to send the money to Ukraine.\nIt's a message being reinforced daily in the media by Jordan and other Trump surrogates, including Reps. Mark Meadows, R-N.C. and Lee Zeldin, R-N.Y., who are also part of the inquiry panels, the person said.\nWhat goes without saying, though, is that few Republicans lawmakers are willing to say the call was \"perfect\" or that there was \"no quid pro quo,\" as Trump insists.\nMore often, they say a little of this, a little of that.\n\"There are perfectly appropriate quid pro quos and there are inappropriate quid pro quos,\" offered Sen. John Kennedy, R-La. \"Just saying that there is a quid pro quo, at least based on my analysis of the evidence that I've seen so far, is a red herring.\"\n"

When Taylor returned to Kyiv, he said he was stunned at what he found.\n\"I discovered a weird combination of encouraging, confusing and ultimately alarming circumstances,\" Taylor testified on Oct. 22.\nThe diplomat went on to describe the \"irregular\" channel of U.S. policymaking, outside the official one. He soon learned it was being run by Trump's personal attorney, Rudy Giuliani, and others from the administration. \"A confusing and unusual arrangement,\" he testified.\nTaylor has served under every presidential administration, Republican and Democrat, since 1985, and also worked for then-Sen.

One senior Ukraine official said she needed to \"watch my back.\"\nShe is a career diplomat having served in several top positions as a principal deputy assistant secretary for the Bureau of European and Eurasian Affairs, a senior adviser and the dean of the language school at the Foreign Service Institute.\nShe is now working as a senior State Department fellow at Georgetown University.\n"

        "text": "Former Massachusetts Gov. Deval Patrick is considering making a late run for the Democratic presidential nomination, according to two people with knowledge of his deliberations, underscoring some Democrats' deep uncertainty about the party's current crop of contenders.\nPatrick, a close friend and ally of former President Barack Obama, ruled out a presidential bid earlier this year but has since been talking with Democratic operatives and donors about launching a campaign. He has not made a final decision on whether to run, but he is expected to do so quickly, given fast-approaching deadlines to get on the ballot in key states.\nPatrick is the second Democrat to weigh jumping into the race at this late juncture, less than three months before the kickoff Iowa caucuses. Former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg is also reconsidering a run, citing concerns about the current Democratic front-runners' ability to defeat President Donald Trump. Bloomberg is expected to make a final decision on his 2020 prospects within days.\nThe people with knowledge of Patrick's deliberations spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the matter publicly.\nDemocrats plunged into the 2020 race with sky high enthusiasm about the prospects of defeating Trump and with a historic number of candidates vying for the nomination. But as the field has started to dwindle, some in the party have raised concerns about the durability of former Vice President Joe Biden and the ability of liberal Sens. Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders to win in a general election.\nAlthough Patrick ruled out a run late last year, he reopened conversations with close friends and aides over the summer but did not take active steps to form a campaign. In recent days, those conversations have intensified, with Patrick gauging interest in a run with donors and Democratic operatives.\nHe would face big hurdles to launching a campaign at this late stage. Unlike Bloomberg, a wealthy billionaire who would self-fund, Patrick would have to quickly raise money to build out a campaign operation and boost his familiarity with voters. Some of his former political advisers are already working for other 2020 candidates, including his former chief of staff Doug Rubin, who is working for Tom Steyer.\nPatrick, who made history as Massachusetts' first black governor, could gain traction in neighboring New Hampshire, which holds the first primary contest. However, he'd face stiff competition there from two other neighboring state candidates: Warren of Massachusetts and Sanders of Vermont.\nNew Hampshire's primary filing deadline is Friday.\nBloomberg plans to skip the early states, where candidates have camped out for months courting voters and building operations. Instead, he's said he would focus on the crush of states that vote on March 3 - dubbed Super Tuesday - and beyond, where more delegates are at stake.\nWhen Patrick decided last year not to run, he cited what he called the \"cruelty\" of the election process.\n\"After a lot of conversation, reflection and prayer, I've decided that a 2020 campaign for president is not for me,\" Patrick had posted on his Facebook page. Patrick said he and his wife worried that the \"cruelty of our elections process would ultimately splash back on people whom Diane and I love, but who hadn't signed up for the journey.\"\nPatrick has tried to position himself as more moderate than his party's left flank and could compete for votes with Biden, who is running as a centrist.\nEarly in his career, Patrick served as assistant attorney general for civil rights in the Clinton administration and later worked as an executive at Texaco and Coca-Cola. Since leaving the governor's office, Patrick has worked as a managing director for Bain Capital - a company co-founded by Mitt Romney and widely criticized by Democrats during Romney's 2012 Republican presidential campaign.\n"

State Attorney General Xavier Becerra is scheduled to make his case on behalf of DACA.\nPresident Trump shared his thoughts Tuesday morning, tweeting, \"Many of the people in DACA, no longer very young, are far from \"angels.\" Some are very tough, hardened criminals. President Obama said he had no legal right to sign order, but would anyway. If Supreme Court remedies with overturn, a deal will be made with Dems for them to stay!\"\nThere did not appear to be any support among the Supreme Court's five conservatives in extended arguments for blocking the program, which currently protects 660,000 undocumented immigrants who came to the United States as children.\nChief Justice John Roberts and Justice Brett Kavanaugh were among the justices who indicated that the administration has provided sufficient reason for wanting to do away with the program. Justices Neil Gorsuch and Samuel Alito raised questions about whether courts should even be reviewing the executive branch's discretionary decisions.\nHowever, the Supreme Court's decision is not expected until June, at the height of the 2020 presidential campaign.\nSome DACA recipients who are part of the lawsuit against Trump's action were in the courtroom for the arguments. Many people camped out in front of the court for days for a chance at some of the few seats available to the general public. Roberts rejected a request to provide live or same-day audio of the arguments. The court will post the audio on its website Friday.\nStudents at several Southland schools, including East L.A.'s Garfield High School, were participating in walkouts Tuesday morning. In downtown Los Angeles, DACA supporters gathered outside the Edward R. Roybal Federal Building before a planned march to MacArthur Park, the site of a rally beginning at 2 p.m.\n\"Everyone belongs here. This is our home,\" a DACA recipient who gave her name only as Leticia told the crowd in emotional remarks. \"This is the only home I know.\"\nL.A. County Supervisor Hilda Solis also held a press conference about the issue at the Los Angeles County Hall of Administration.\n\"We have more DACA recipients than any other county in this country,\" Solis noted. \"We hear them, we embrace them and we believe in them.\"\nA mass was held in support of so-called Dreamers Monday night in North Hollywood.\nJose Flores has lived in L.A. since he was 4. He studied at UC Berkeley and owns a small business with his parents. DACA afforded him immigration status that his parents have never been able to achieve, but regardless of how the court rules, the decision won't change the country he calls home.\n\"I've always felt like an American so I've acted as it,\" Flores said. \"This is my home. This is my church. I've been coming here for about 20 years or so and my family's here. My life is here.\"\nIf the Supreme Court agrees with the Trump administration in the DACA case, Congress could follow up by putting the program on surer legal footing. But the absence of comprehensive immigration reform from Congress is what prompted Obama to create DACA in 2012, giving people two-year renewable reprieves from the threat of deportation while also allowing them to work.\nFederal courts struck down an expansion of DACA and the creation of similar protections for undocumented immigrants whose children are U.S. citizens.\nTrump's anti-immigrant rhetoric was a key part of his presidential campaign in 2016, and his administration pointed to the invalidation of the expansion and the threat of a lawsuit against DACA by Texas and other Republican-led states as reasons to bring the program to a halt.\nYoung immigrants, civil rights groups, universities and Democratic-led cities and states sued to block the administration. They persuaded courts in New York, San Francisco and Washington, D.C., that the administration had been \"arbitrary and capricious\" in its actions, in violation of a federal law that requires policy changes to be done in an orderly way."

What was not announced was that the 3:13 train that I was going to get would be canceled. That announcement came in at 3:15 and it just said 3:13 was cancelled, no reason given,\" he said.\nHe continued.\n\"There was no announcement that the 3:51 train would be the next train,\" Resto said. \"People were left to figure this out on their own and then when I went to my iPhone to check the website to see if there was any information ... there was none, it didn't even show up.\"\n(NJ Transit did tweet that this train was canceled at 1:18 p.m., and offer when the next train was coming.)\nHe made other suggestions to improve operations, including having the senate approve nominees for the NJ Transit board that currently has three people, change the law that identifies the Department of Transportation commissioner as the NJ Transit board chair, and ensure the agency meets with advocacy groups like the one he represents, the New Jersey Association of Rail Passengers.\nSen.

This is precious time I could use to be more rested or with my family,\" she said.\nOther improvements she requested: buses that can better accommodate passengers getting on and off the bus, making the bus cost a flat fee instead of the complicated zone system, and adding bus shelters with heat lamps.\nThe hearing took place in the high-ceiling waiting area of Hoboken Terminal, which was marginally warmer than the near-freezing temperatures just outside the doors bustling with awaiting passengers, some who rerouted to the terminal because of delays out of New York Penn Station on Wednesday afternoon.\nSome commuters paused to hear their fellow riders describe the all-too-familiar traveling woes.\nSiddharth Tailor, of Clifton, had 45 minutes to kill before his train home left Hoboken Terminal, a station he doesn't doesn't normally travel through but because of New York Penn Station delays he diverted this way.\n\"One of the concerns that I have is that there's never enough time,\" Tailor said. \"Most of the time, the trains from Penn Station run late and reach Secaucus just on time, and people have to run.\"\nThe new double-decker trains have been a welcome improvement, offering more space for passengers, he said, but the high fares don't match the level of service.\nSweeney opposes fare hikes\nSenate President Steve Sweeney said the panel will hold several more hearings in the coming weeks with those in operations at NJ Transit, transit experts and others.\nSweeney said he hopes they can present Gov. Phil Murphy with findings and solutions for issues like a steady funding resource for the agency before budget negotiations begin in February.\n\"They're not going to be able to get better if we can't fund them properly, so it's identifying funding, it's looking at operations and how we improve operations, looking at how we can expand transit in the future,\" he said.\nHe added that addressing the budget issues with increasing fares would not be on his list of solutions.\n\"I would be vehemently opposed to a fare hike,\" Sweeney said. \"Asking commuters to increase fares, not acceptable, not when they're providing the service that they're providing right now.\"\nThe Murphy administration has made reforming NJ Transit a priority and the agency is making \"meaningful progress,\" according to a statement from spokeswoman Alyana Alfaro.\n\"Governor Murphy inherited an agency that had been ravaged by the Christie Administration's neglect and mismanagement,\" the statement said. \"Some of the legislators who are participating in today's hearing stood by and watched as Governor Christie transformed NJ TRANSIT from one of the best transit agencies in the nation to one of the worst.\"\nOrlando Riley, vice president of the Local 819 union for bus operators and mechanics, also told the senators that NJ Transit is improving.\n\"When the new administration came in, they recognized that we had a problem and they worked with the unions and we hired over 500 operators in a short period of time,\" Riley said. \"We have seen a lot of progress and there's a lot more to be done.\"\nNJ Transit 'Innovation Challenge':How to move crowds in and out of the Meadowlands\nMinimum wage:Should NJ pause $15 minimum wage in recession?

Ross Spano (R-Fla.) over allegations of campaign finance violations, the House Ethics Committee announced Thursday. \n\nThe committee said it had agreed to defer the review of the allegations to the DOJ at the DOJ's request.\n\nThe Ethics Committee had been reviewing the allegations since September.\n\n\"The Department of Justice has asked the Committee to defer consideration of this matter and the Committee, following precedent, unanimously voted to defer consideration of this matter at this time,\" the committee said in the release \n\nAn official for the Department of Justice was not immediately available for comment. \n\nAhead of the committee's review, Spano had faced scrutiny for accepting about $180,000 in loans from friends and using it for his congressional campaign as if it were his own money. \n\nCampaign finance laws allow candidates to loan their campaigns any amount of personal funds, but loans from others are considered campaign contributions and limited to $2,700 donations per cycle. \n\nSpano has said he has since repaid the loans and said on Thursday that his office would cooperate fully with the investigation.\n\n\"As I've said before, we acknowledged that mistakes were made with respect to the campaign loans, but those mistakes were completely inadvertent and unintentional,\" he said in a statement. \"We were the ones who self-reported this to the FEC. We are confident that upon review, the Justice Department will see it that way, too. I continue to have doubts about the timing and motive behind this inquiry, as the impeachment proceedings this week have shown me how far the left will go to destroy their opponents.

Boudin was just 14 months old when his left-wing activist parents were incarcerated for their role in an armed robbery that killed three men.\nHis close-up view of the criminal justice system shaped his career as a public defender who vowed to make sweeping reforms if elected to serve as the city's top prosecutor.\nBy electing Boudin, San Francisco voters added to a nationwide wave of victories by district attorney candidates who promised a radical departure from the punitive, law-and-order policies of the past. Boudin described his victory as a bellwether in the liberal movement to refocus the criminal justice system on rehabilitation rather than punishment.\nLoftus, who had received endorsements from Mayor London Breed, Gov.

Adam Schiff, D-Calif., who runs the inquiry, said in a recent letter to the committee's ranking Republican Rep.

        "text": "Pam Bondi was once a fixture on Tampa Bay television stations, appearing regularly on the 6 o'clock news from crime scenes and courtrooms.\nExpect to see much more of her \u2014 only this time on national television, and at all hours.\nOver the next year, Bondi will use one of her greatest political skills \u2014 an ability to connect with TV audiences \u2014 on behalf of President Donald Trump.\nRELATED: Pam Bondi's career path could lead to post in Trump's White House\nThe White House announced last week that Bondi, 53, had been hired temporarily to coordinate and be the public face of the response to the House's impeachment inquiry into Trump, someone Bondi has been close to for years.\nFor one of the greatest dramas in American political history, Bondi is straight out of \"central casting,\" said Adam Goodman, who engineered her run for Florida attorney general in 2010.\n\"She feels the moment. This was the moment she could be most impactful for the president and the country,\" Goodman said. \"People are going to discover all over again what Pam Bondi's made of.\"\nWhat she brings to Washington is decades of experience in front of the cameras, combined with a hyper-partisanship she shared with then-Gov. Rick Scott that left her deeply controversial in Florida.\n\"Rick Scott and Pam Bondi's approach was, \u2018Public opinion be damned, I'm going to toe the party line, and I'm not going to veer in any direction that could be met with resistance from the Republican base,' \" said state Rep. Carlos Guillermo Smith, D-Orlando.\nAfter leaving office, Bondi started lobbying this summer for Ballard Partners, the Florida-based firm that has shifted its focus to Washington following Trump's election.\nAnd that's where she worked until last week, when Trump beckoned her for a gig that will put Bondi, once again, in front of the TV cameras.\nBondi was a lifetime prosecutor and semi-regular spokeswoman for the Hillsborough State Attorney's Office when she decided to run for public office 10 years ago.\nShe had years of experience on local and national television, and she frequently weighed in on the nation's courtroom dramas as a guest on CNN and Fox News.\nWhen Goodman pushed her run for attorney general, one of the first things he did was hold a focus group that compared his new client to other Republicans in the field.\nBoth of her opponents had more time in elected office. But nearly every member of the focus group was drawn to Bondi, then a career prosecutor with hours of experience in front of television cameras.\nThe message was clear, Goodman said: Get Bondi on TV and let her make her case.\n\"They really felt that they could trust her,\" Goodman said.\nRELATED: Pam Bondi, with Republican attorney general coalition, involves herself in faraway court fights\nShe ran on a pro-business agenda, and she made good on it in office. She challenged the Affordable Care Act and the Environmental Protection Agency's limits on air pollutants. She decided not to investigate complaints made about Trump University by Floridians who claimed the university's real estate courses were fraudulent at about the same time her campaign accepted a $25,000 check from Trump's charitable foundation.\nRELATED: Pam Bondi breaks silence, defends handling of Trump University issue\nAfter leaving office in January, Bondi was offered television shows and was rumored for multiple federal government jobs. She instead chose to lobby, joining the firm run by Brian Ballard.\nShe's spent the summer lobbying in Washington on behalf of more than a dozen companies and entities, including private prisons operator Geo Group for \"promoting the use of public-private partnerships in correctional services,\" federal records show.\nShe also flew to Kuwait on behalf of another client, Kuwait-based KGL Investment Company, whose CEO, Marsha Lazareva, a Russian national, was recently indicted on two counts of money laundering by Kuwaiti authorities.\nThe company, which maintains the charges are bogus, has paid Ballard's firm $300,000 this year to lobby U.S. officials on whether Magnitsky Act sanctions could be used to target Kuwaiti officials who have been in a long-running dispute with the firm.\n\"The first time I saw her (Lazareva) in court, she was in shackles, this little woman, and they had her locked up in a barbed-wire prison where temperatures topped 100 degrees,\" Bondi told Newsmax in September.\nPerhaps her most controversial client, however, was Qatar, the tiny Persian Gulf nation that is hosting the 2022 World Cup. More than 90 percent of the country's workforce consists of migrant workers, who remain vulnerable to exploitation and abuse to the companies that hire them.\nWhile the country has made efforts to crack down, they've been seen as half-measures by human rights organizations, who say the country has invested more in its image than in reforms.\n\"They've put a lot more money and time and investment into projecting that image instead of fixing things on the ground,\" said Hiba Zayadin, a researcher for Human Rights Watch.\nThe country was paying Ballard $115,000 a month.\nZayadin, who was unaware of Bondi's work for Qatar, warned that people being paid by the country could be used to cover real problems.\n\"They've got to be really careful about not misrepresenting the situation on the ground,\" Zayadin said. \"They could risk acting like someone who's whitewashing the country's abuses.\"\nFederal records show Bondi's job was advising the country on human trafficking efforts and providing \"support regarding Qatari relations with U.S. government officials, U.S. business entities, and non-governmental audiences, in dealing with matters pertaining to combating human trafficking.\"\nThe Qatari embassy did not return a request for comment on Bondi's work. Bondi referred comments to fellow Ballard lobbyist Justin Sayfie, who said she did not lobby for the country. He said her work \"has been solely focused on assisting Qatar develop effective anti-human trafficking efforts related to the 2022 World Cup.\"\nBondi also lobbied on human trafficking issues on behalf of Major League Baseball and the Tampa-based US Institute Against Human Trafficking, a Christian-focused nonprofit advocacy group. Her work for the institute included \"human trafficking awareness\" and \"federal financial participation,\" federal records show.\nWhile she championed anti-human trafficking work as attorney general, her results were mixed. A 2015 investigation by the Florida Center for Investigative Reporting found just 51 people were charged by her office in her first five years.\nAnd Pasco County Circuit Court Judge Lynn Tepper told WFTS-TV in 2016 that she was frustrated that Bondi was not doing enough to combat trafficking, telling the station that \"it's not about getting your picture on a billboard.\"\nTepper stood by her words when reached Monday.\n\"My opinion never changed,\" Tepper said in a text message, \"as I was unaware of what she did individually to cause change.\"\nIn Washington, her strengths \u2014 and friendship with Trump \u2014 could help her survive what has often been a ruthless revolving door in the White House, friends and allies said.\n\"She's a very, very loyal person,\" said Hillsborough County Tax Collector Doug Belden, who has been friends with her for decades. \"If you're a friend, you're a friend for life, and she never forgets that.\"\nInformation from the Associated Press and McClatchy White House correspondent Michael Wilner contributed to this report.\n"

        "text": "House Intelligence Chairman Adam Schiff made clear on Saturday that the Ukraine whistleblower won't be testifying in the impeachment inquiry, arguing that the individual's testimony would be \"redundant and unnecessary.\"\nHouse Republicans earlier Saturday had submitted a list of witnesses to Democrats that they'd like to testify as part of the chamber's impeachment inquiry into President Donald Trump and Ukraine. The list included the whistleblower and former Vice President Joe Biden's son Hunter Biden.\nIn a letter obtained by CNN, Schiff goes further than he did earlier in the day when he said in a statement that his committee would evaluate the witness requests and \"give due consideration to witnesses within the scope of the impeachment inquiry, as voted on by the House.\"\n\"The impeachment inquiry, moreover, has gathered an ever-growing body of evidence \u2013 from witnesses and documents, including the President's own words in his July 25 call record \u2013 that not only confirms, but far exceeds, the initial information in the whistleblower's complaint. The whistleblower's testimony is therefore redundant and unnecessary. In light of the President's threats, the individual's appearance before us would only place their personal safety at grave risk,\" Schiff wrote to California Rep. Devin Nunes, the top Republican on the House Intelligence Committee. \nThe comments by Schiff, one of the Democrats in charge of the inquiry, are the clearest yet that the whistleblower won't testify in the probe, a dramatic shift since the beginning of the impeachment inquiry in September when the individual's testimony was viewed as paramount. The committee had engaged in a round of private talks to protect the whistleblower while allowing him or her to provide testimony, including disguising the individual's identity or conducting the interview off-site.\nBut as a parade of witnesses have corroborated the whistleblower's account, detailing the under-the-radar push by the President and his allies to have Ukraine probe his political foes, and as Trump has stepped up his attacks against the person, Democrats have abandoned the idea of securing the testimony.\nIn a letter to Schiff earlier Saturday, Republicans had listed the anonymous whistleblower, Hunter Biden, former US special envoy for Ukraine Kurt Volker, high-ranking State Department official David Hale and Tim Morrison, the top Russia and Europe adviser on the National Security Council among the people they wanted to testify.\nThe GOP also requested Nellie Ohr, a former Fusion GPS contractor, and Alexandra Chalupa, a former Democratic National Committee staffer \u2014a sign that Republicans still want to focus on unsubstantiated claims related to the 2016 presidential campaign.\n\"As of right now, they are giving us no witnesses,\" Nunes told Fox News' Jeanine Pirro on Saturday night.\nThe whistleblower's attorney reacted on Saturday to the GOP's call for testimony from his client by reiterating that the person is only willing to answer questions in writing.\n\"My client's complaint has been largely corroborated. Nonetheless, I have offered to have my client respond in writing, under oath, and under penalty of perjury to Republican questions,\" Andrew Bakaj said in a statement to CNN. \nThe whistleblower complaint alleges that Trump abused his official powers \"to solicit interference\" from Ukraine in the upcoming 2020 election, and that the White House took steps to cover it up. Trump has denied any wrongdoing.\nIn the GOP letter to Schiff, Nunes bashed what he called a \"sham impeachment process\" and said that Republicans were calling the witnesses to testify in an open setting to \"provide transparency to your otherwise opaque and unfair process.\"\nTrump has pushed an unproven accusation that then-Vice President Biden improperly tried to help his son by pressuring the Ukrainian government to fire the country's prosecutor general. Hunter Biden served on the board of the Ukrainian natural gas company at the time.\nThere is no evidence of wrongdoing by either Joe or Hunter Biden in Ukraine.\nImpeachment hearings are set to begin next week as Democrats prepare to take their case against Trump to the public. The open hearings will be the first time the US hears directly from the officials at the center of allegations against Trump.\nSchiff had announced that three witnesses are set to publicly testify next week \u2013 US diplomat Bill Taylor and State Department official George Kent will appear on Wednesday, and former US Ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch is set to testify Friday.\n"

        "text": "Hundreds rallied Saturday afternoon in front of the Texas Governor's Mansion in Austin, hoping their pleas for death row inmate Rodney Reed's execution to be stayed would reach the ears of the man who has the power to do so: Gov. Greg Abbott.\nStanding just feet from Abbott's residence, Rodney Reed's mother, Sandra Reed, had a message for him.\n\"It is time for change. We need to scrutinize the people we vote in to serve and protect us. Because just as there are evildoers, we have good people too. I heard that Governor Abbott is a good man. Well, I say actions speak louder,\" Reed said. \"Show me and the world just how good of a man you are. Take into consideration all of what you know, all of what you've seen and the evidence. There are others that were before you that didn't live up to their oath. Will you?\n\"Will you stop this wrongful and painful execution of my son? If you don't, then you are just as guilty of murder.\"\nFor many attendees who chanted, marched and signed petitions and letters requesting clemency, the rally was an urgent one as Reed's execution date nears.\nReed is scheduled to be executed in less than two weeks, on Nov. 20. He was convicted for the 1996 murder of 19-year-old Stacey Stites in Bastrop. His case has gained national attention, from politicians to high-profile celebrities who have requested his execution be postponed in light of new evidence. Many of Tarrant County's state lawmakers have added their voices to the growing calls.\nReed, who is now 51 years old, has long maintained his innocence. His attorneys filed an application for clemency late last month, requesting that the Board of Pardons and Paroles recommend a commutation Reed's death sentence to a life sentence.\nReed's attorneys have pointed to Stites' fiance, Jimmy Fennell, as the killer, and noted in the application for clemency that new witnesses have come forward testifying to that fact, including an affidavit from a former inmate who said Fennell once told him he had killed his fiance.\nThe new evidence in the case wasn't lost on the hundreds that gathered outside Abbott's residence for over two hours.\nSome held signs that read, \"In Texas your race determines your rights\"; \"Execute justice, not Rodney Reed\"; and \"What if Reed was white and Fennell was black,\" while security officers looked on from the lawn of the mansion.\nAfter hearing death row exonerees, civil rights advocates \u2013 like activist Shaun King and attorney Lee Merritt, who is representing the family of Atatiana Jefferson \u2013 and members of Reed's family urge Abbott to take action, chants of \"Free Rodney Reed\" echoed from the streets, as those gathered circled the governor's residence while they marched.\nHeather Campbell Stobbs, a cousin of the victim, Stites, said Reed deserves a retrial at the very least. She pointed to Fennell as Stites' murderer.\n\"It's not justice for Stacey to incarcerate and kill a man when there are so many questions about her death. And we owe it to her to get this right,\" Stobbs said.\nRodrick Reed, Rodney Reed's brother, said the past 23 years have felt like a nightmare from which he can't wake up. It has forever changed him, and he said his brother's case is bigger than itself.\n\"This is not just about Rodney. This is about rights. This is about justice. This is about the truth,\" Rodrick Reed said.\nHe called on those gathered to work toward ending the death penalty in Texas.\n\"I know it's not going to be an easy job, but we can raise enough noise where they'll give us a moratorium \u2013 a temporary state of all executions,\" Rodrick Reed said. \"If you can't give it back, don't take it. And you cannot give back a life once you have took it.\""

        "text": "Rep. Paul Gosar published a series of tweets Wednesday whose first letter collectively spell out \"Epstein didn't kill himself,\" linking him to a new story in conservative media that claims former New York billionaire Jeffrey Epstein didn't hang himself awaiting trial on sex-trafficking charges.\nThe tweets, all weighing in on the impeachment inquiry against President Donald Trump in one way or another, began at 5:21 a.m. Arizona time and continued through 1 p.m.\nA little more than an hour later, the conservative Daily Caller had published a story noting the cryptic message hidden in Gosar's Twitter commentary.\nA spokesman for Gosar, a five-term Arizona Republican, had a cheeky response when asked about the message.\n\"All of the tweets pertained to testimony from today's hearing,\" Ben Goldey told The Arizona Republic. \"Rest assured, they are substantive. Every one of them. All of them. 5 were brilliant. 1 was ok.\"\nGosar tweeted out the same response from his official account. The first word of each sentence spelled out \"AREA 51.\"\nUsing his personal account, Gosar also suggested he was just having fun. He tweeted out a story about his tweets and asked, \"What? Epstein didn't kill himself?\"\nThe tweets seem intended to draw more attention to a recent story by the right-wing Project Veritas. It was based on a leaked videotape in which ABC reporter Amy Robach complained her employer would not run a story three years ago in which she had linked Epstein to sex with minors, the allegation that landed him behind bars when authorities say he committed suicide on Aug. 10.\nMost media outlets have not previously noted the lack of a story about ABC sitting on an Epstein story. Fox News wrote about the ongoing silence, adding to a growing push in conservative quarters to a conspiracy theory that Epstein died from foul play.\nTo many, Gosar is known as the member of Congress whose siblings endorsed his opponent in the 2018 election because they viewed him as a political extremist. But that event was only the capstone to years of controversies.\nIn October 2017, Gosar suggested in an interview with \"Vice News\" for Home Box Office that the deadly white-supremacist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, was planned by \"an Obama sympathizer\" and that liberal activist George Soros may have been a Nazi collaborator as a youth.\nBefore Trump's State of the Union speech in 2018, Gosar called for the arrest and deportation of undocumented immigrants who were attending the speech at the invitation of Democratic members of Congress, including from Arizona.\nBefore that, Gosar outlined his views on \"dreamers,\" young immigrants who were brought to the United States illegally as children, in an interview with Frank Gaffney, an anti-Muslim activist who has peddled his own widely discredited conspiracies. Gosar has said he opposes any special legal protection for those known as DACA recipients.\n\"Providing any lawful or legal status to DACA recipients that allows them to stay in the country and work is the definition of amnesty,\" he said at the time.\nEarlier this year, he was part of a documentary showing the efforts of former Trump adviser Steve Bannon to corral support among far-right European political figures as part of a trip ostensibly about better understanding free speech issues.\nOn the same trip, Gosar spoke in London in support of a British man banned from social media for espousing what was deemed hate speech and who was jailed for repeatedly violating court-ordered privacy during a criminal trial."

        "text": "The closed doors of the Trump impeachment investigation are swinging wide open.\nWhen the gavel strikes at the start of the House hearing Wednesday morning, America and the rest of the world will have the chance to see and hear for themselves for the first time about President Donald Trump's actions toward Ukraine and consider whether they are, in fact, impeachable offenses.\nIt's a remarkable moment, even for a White House full of them.\nAll on TV, committee then comes the main feature: Two seasoned diplomats, William Taylor, the graying former infantry officer now charge d'affaires in Ukraine, and George Kent, the deputy assistant secretary in Washington, telling the striking, if sometimes complicated story of a president allegedly using foreign policy for personal and political gain ahead of the 2020 election.\nSo far, the narrative is splitting Americans, mostly along the same lines as Trump's unusual presidency. The Constitution sets a dramatic, but vague, bar for impeachment, and there's no consensus yet that Trump's actions at the heart of the inquiry meet the threshold of \"high crimes and misdemeanors.\"\nWhether Wednesday's proceedings begin to end a presidency or help secure Trump's position, it's certain that his chaotic term has finally arrived at a place he cannot control and a force, the constitutional system of checks and balances, that he cannot ignore.\nThe country has been here just three times before, and never against the backdrop of social media and real-time commentary, including from the president himself.\n\"These hearings will address subjects of profound consequence for the Nation and the functioning of our government under the Constitution,\" said Democratic Rep. Adam Schiff of California, the chairman of the Intelligence Committee leading the inquiry, in a memo to lawmakers.\nSchiff called it a \"solemn undertaking,\" and counseled colleagues to \"approach these proceedings with the seriousness of purpose and love of country that they demand.\"\n\"Total impeachment scam,\" tweeted the president, as he does virtually every day.\nImpeachments are rare, historians say, because they amount to nothing short of the nullification of an election. Starting down this road poses risks for both Democrats and Republicans as proceedings push into the 2020 campaign.\nUnlike the Watergate hearings and Richard Nixon, there is not yet a \"cancer on the presidency\" moment galvanizing public opinion. Nor is there the national shrug, as happened when Bill Clinton's impeachment ultimately didn't result in his removal from office. It's perhaps most like the partisanship-infused impeachment of Andrew Johnson after the Civil War.\nTrump calls the whole thing a \"witch hunt,\" a retort that echoes Nixon's own defense. Republicans say Democrats have been trying to get rid of this president since he first took office, starting with former special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into Russian interference to help Trump in the 2016 election.\n\u5e7f\u544a\nDemocratic House Speaker Nancy Pelosi was initially reluctant to launch a formal impeachment inquiry. As Democrats took control of the House in January, Pelosi said impeachment would be \"too divisive\" for the country. Trump, she said, was simply \"not worth it.\"\nAfter Mueller's appearance on Capitol Hill in July for the end of the Russia probe, the door to impeachment proceedings seemed closed.\nBut the next day Trump got on the phone.\nFor the past month, witness after witness has testified under oath about his July 25 phone call with Ukraine's newly elected president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, and the alarms it set off in U.S. diplomatic and national security circles.\nIn a secure room in the Capitol basement, current and former officials have been telling lawmakers what they know. They've said an earlier Trump call in April congratulating Zelenskiy on his election victory seemed fine. The former U.S. reality TV host and the young Ukrainian comedian hit it off.\nBut in the July call, things turned.\nAn anonymous whistleblower first alerted officials to the phone call. \"I have received information from multiple U.S. Government officials that the President of the United States is using the power of his office to solicit interference from a foreign country in the 2020 election,\" the person wrote in August to the House and Senate Intelligence committees. Democrats fought for the letter to be released to them as required.\n\"I am deeply concerned,\" the whistleblower wrote.\nTrump insisted the call was \"perfect.\" The White House released a rough transcript. Pelosi, given the nod from her most centrist freshman lawmakers, opened the inquiry.\n\"The president has his opportunity to prove his innocence,\" she told Noticias Telemundo on Tuesday.\nDefying White House orders not to appear, witnesses have testified that Trump's acting chief of staff, Mick Mulvaney, was withholding U.S. military aid to the budding democracy until the new Ukraine government conducted investigations Trump wanted into Democrats in the 2016 election and his potential 2020 rival, Joe Biden, and his son, Hunter.\nIt was all part of what Taylor, the long-serving top diplomat in Ukraine, called the \"irregular\" foreign policy being led by Trump's personal attorney, Rudy Giuliani, outside of traditional channels.\nTaylor said it was \"crazy\" that the Trump administration was withholding U.S. military assistance to the East European ally over the political investigations, with Russian forces on Ukraine's border on watch for a moment of weakness.\nKent, the bowtie-wearing State Department official, told investigators there were three things Trump wanted of Ukraine: \"Investigations, Biden, Clinton.\"\nOn Friday, the public is scheduled to hear from Marie Yovanovitch, the former U.S. ambassador to Ukraine, who told investigators she was warned to \"watch my back\" as Trump undercut and then recalled her.\nEight more witnesses will testify in public hearings next week.\n\"What this affords is the opportunity for the cream of our diplomatic corps to tell the American people a clear and consistent story of what the president did,\" said Rep. Mike Quigley, D-Ill., a member of the Intelligence panel.\n\"It takes a lot of courage to do what they are doing,\" he said, \"and they are probably just going to be abused for it.\"\nRepublicans, led on the panel by Rep. Devin Nunes, a longtime Trump ally from California, will argue that none of those witnesses has first-hand knowledge of the president's actions. They will say Ukraine never felt pressured and the aid money eventually flowed, in September.\nYet Republicans are struggling to form a unified defense of Trump. Instead they often fall back on criticism of the process.\nSome Republicans align with Trump's view, which is outside of mainstream intelligence findings, that Ukraine was involved in 2016 U.S. election interference. They want to hear from Hunter Biden, who served on the board of a gas company in Ukraine, Burisma, while his father was the vice president. And they are trying to bring forward the still-anonymous whistleblower, whose identity Democrats have vowed to protect.\nThe framers of the Constitution provided few details about how the impeachment proceedings should be run, leaving much for Congress to decide. Democrats say the White House's refusal to provide witnesses or produce documents is obstruction and itself impeachable.\nHearings are expected to continue and will shift, likely by Thanksgiving, to the Judiciary Committee to consider actual articles of impeachment.\nThe House, which is controlled by Democrats, is expected to vote by Christmas.\nThat would launch a trial in the Senate, where Republicans have the majority, in the new year.\n"

        "text": "Testimony in the colorful trial of Roger Stone \u2014 featuring talk of dognapping and Godfather references \u2014 wrapped up Tuesday with a top Trump campaign official telling jurors that Stone tried to contact Jared Kushner to \"debrief\" him about hacked emails damaging to Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign.\nWhile Stone's trial in Washington didn't produce the bombshells about President Donald Trump that some expected, the testimony over the last week reinforced that those at the highest ranks of the Trump campaign were eager to gather information about WikiLeaks' plan to release the damaging emails and saw Stone \u2014 who had repeatedly inferred he had inside information about those plans \u2014 as the best person to gather that intelligence.\nStone, a longtime Trump friend and ally, is charged with witness tampering and lying to Congress about his attempts to contact WikiLeaks about the damaging material during the 2016 presidential campaign.\nStone, who has denied wrongdoing, did not testify. His attorneys rested after playing a tape of his congressional testimony. Closing arguments are scheduled for Wednesday.\nThroughout the trial, prosecutors used Stone's own text messages and emails \u2014 some of which appeared to contradict his congressional testimony \u2014 to lay out their case that he lied to Congress and threatened a witness.\nRick Gates, who was Trump's deputy campaign chairman and became a key cooperator in the special counsel's Russia probe, told jurors he received a text message from Stone on June 15, 2016, asking for Kushner's contact information. He said Stone wanted to \"debrief\" Kushner on developments about the hacked emails. Kushner was a senior campaign adviser at the time.\nGates did not say if Stone received Kushner's information. Kushner's attorney did not respond to a message seeking comment.\nThe prosecution rested its case after recalling a former FBI agent who had previously testified about a series of phone calls between Stone and then-candidate Trump \u2014 including three calls on July 14, 2016 \u2014 the day that a massive hack of the Democratic National Committee's servers was reported.\nThe president told special counsel Robert Mueller's prosecutors in written responses to questions that he had no recollection of any particular conversations about the hacked emails.\nStone, whose history in Republican political circles dates back to the Nixon era, was charged as part of Mueller's investigation into Russia interference in the 2016 presidential election.\nStone has consistently criticized the case against him as politically motivated and the judge overseeing his case had to issue a gag order in February after he posted a photo on Instagram of the judge with what appeared to be crosshairs of a gun.\nHis trial has become somewhat of a spectacle in Washington \u2014 even as the world's eyes were drawn to the House impeachment inquiry. Before the trial even began, a spectator collapsed during jury selection and Stone later fell ill and needed to leave early because of food poisoning .\nOn another day, as Stone dined in the courthouse cafeteria with right-wing provocateur Milo Yiannopoulos, protesters turned a large inflatable rat that looked like Trump toward the cafeteria windows.\nJurors also heard from Randy Credico, a New York radio talk show host and comedian who scored an interview with WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange in 2016, when he was avoiding prosecution by sheltering in the Ecuadoran embassy in London.\nDuring the 2016 campaign, Stone had mentioned in interviews and public appearances that he was in contact with Assange through a trusted intermediary and hinted at inside knowledge of WikiLeaks' plans. But he started pressing Credico to broker a contact, and Credico testified that he told Stone to work through his own intermediary.\nYet earlier testimony revealed that Stone, while appearing before the House Intelligence Committee, named Credico as his intermediary to Assange and pressured Credico not to contradict him.\nAfter Credico was contacted by Congress, he reached out to Stone, who told him he should \"stonewall it\" and \"plead the fifth,\" he testified.\nStone called a Credico a \"rat\" and a \"stoolie\" in a threatening April 2018 email. Credico also testified that Stone used repeated references from the movie \"The Godfather Part II\" to intimidate him into either backing up Stone's testimony to Congress or refusing to testify.\nProsecutors said Stone had also threatened Credico's therapy dog, a Coton de Tulear named Bianca.\n\"I'm going to take that dog away from you,\" prosecutors said Stone wrote in the threatening message.\nStone briefly served on Trump's campaign but was pushed out amid infighting with campaign manager Corey Lewandowski. Though sidelined, he continued to communicate with Trump and stayed plugged into his circle of advisers.\nProsecutors charged that he repeatedly lied to Congress \"because the truth looked bad\" for the president.\nEven his lawyer, Bruce Rogow, didn't deny that Stone had told the House committee things that were untrue. Rogow described his client as a natural braggart whose claims of insider information didn't match reality.\nBut, he argued, Stone didn't have any \"corrupt intent.\"\nGates' appearance on Tuesday came about a week after the Justice Department released documents detailing how he described the campaign's interest in obtaining stolen emails of Democrats to the FBI. He repeated some of those details in his testimony Tuesday.\nOn the stand, Gates described overhearing a speakerphone conversation in July 2016 between Stone and Paul Manafort, his longtime business associate and the campaign chairman, after WikiLeaks released its first batch of emails, and Stone told Manafort that \"additional information would be forthcoming.\"\n\"Mr. Manafort thought it would be great,\" Gates testified.\nAt the end of July, Gates said he was with Trump on a car ride from Trump Tower to LaGuardia Airport when Trump was in the midst of a conversation with Stone, whose voice Gates recognized on the other end of the line.\nDefense lawyers objected to the question when Gates was asked about it, but he was allowed to testify that Trump indicated after the call concluded that \"more information would be coming,\" presumably related to WikiLeaks.\n"

        "title": "Supreme Court Hears Arguments On DACA; Conservative Justices Appear To Back Trump",
        "text": "As hundreds of pro-DACA demonstrators protested outside the U.S. Supreme Court and thousands of students in Los Angeles walked out of class, the high court's conservative majority seems prepared to allow the Trump administration to end a program that allows some immigrants to work legally in the United States and protects them from deportation.\nThere did not appear to be any support among the five conservatives in extended arguments Tuesday for blocking the administration's decision to wind down the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program. It currently protects 660,000 undocumented immigrants who came to the United States as children.\nCalifornia Attorney General Xavier Becerra argued on behalf of DACA before the Court.\n\"We're here to say that we understand that this nation is based on the rule of law,\" Becerra said at a news conference on the steps of the Supreme Court following the hearing. \"We understand, as we learned it from childhood, that there's a right way and a wrong way, and we're to stand up for the right way to do things. And that's why we believe the DACA recipients, the dreamers of America, and immigrants who must live in the shadow, will someday get to prove the nine justices of the Supreme Court got it done the right way.\"\n\"There's a right way and a wrong way to do things,\" he added. \"The federal government tried to terminate the DACA program the wrong way.\"\nChief Justice John Roberts and Justice Brett Kavanaugh were among the justices who indicated that the administration has provided sufficient reason for wanting to do away with the program. Justices Neil Gorsuch and Samuel Alito raised questions about whether courts should even be reviewing the executive branch's discretionary decisions.\nThe high court's decision is expected by June, at the height of the 2020 presidential campaign. The case is not over whether DACA itself is legal but the administration's approach to ending it. For the tens of thousands of people affected by DACA, the difference is largely academic.\nDACA currently protects mostly Hispanic young adults, from deportation and provides them work permits, though not a path to citizenship. The program was begun under President Barack Obama in 2012. The Trump administration announced in September 2017 that it would end DACA protections, but lower federal courts have stepped in to keep the program alive.\nThe Trump administration has argued that Obama exceeded his constitutional powers by bypassing Congress when he created DACA by executive action. He has made his hardline immigration policies, including pursuing construction of a wall along the U.S.-Mexican border, a centerpiece of his presidency and his re-election campaign for 2020.\nIn Los Angeles, meanwhile, supporters of the Coalition for Humane Immigrant Rights held a series of actions in support of the DACA program. Students staged walkouts at Garfield, Warren, Academia, Avance, Marshall and other high school campuses. A rally with students and members of the public took place at the Molecule Man sculpture at the Federal Building in Little Tokyo.\n\"Two of my cousins have DACA, and it will disrupt my whole family and my community as a whole,\" Garfield High student Gilbert Gomez told CBS2. \"There's so many undocumented immigrants that have DACA in my school, my cousins, and in general.\"\nRally participants parched to MacArthur Park in Westlake, which was followed by an information fair, rally and concert.\nLos Angeles County Supervisor Hilda L. Solis, a former Obama cabinet member, held a news conference in Los Angeles Tuesday morning to showcase support for DACA beneficiaries. She was joined by DACA beneficiaries, Rigoberto Reyes, executive director for the county office of Immigrant Affairs, L.A. Community College District Chancellor Francisco Rodriguez, and members of civic groups.\nPresident Donald Trump tweeted Tuesday that if the Supreme Court overturns the immigrants' protections \"a deal will be made with the Dems for them to stay!\" But Trump's past promises to work with Democrats on a legislative solution for these immigrants have not led to an agreement.\nTrump said in his tweet that many program participants are \"far from 'angels,\" and he falsely claimed that \"some are very tough, hardened criminals.\" The program bars anyone with a felony conviction from participating. Serious misdemeanors may also bar eligibility.\nSome DACA recipients who are part of the lawsuit against Trump's action were in the courtroom for the arguments. Many people camped out in front of the court for days for a chance at some of the few seats available to the general public. Roberts rejected a request to provide live or same-day audio of the arguments. The court will post the audio on its website on Friday.\nA second case being argued Tuesday tests whether the parents of a Mexican teenager who was killed by a U.S. border patrol agent in a shooting across the southern border in El Paso, Texas, can sue the agent in American courts.\nIf the court agrees with the administration in the DACA case, Congress could follow up by putting the program on surer legal footing. But the absence of comprehensive immigration reform from Congress is what prompted Obama to create DACA in 2012, giving people two-year renewable reprieves from the threat of deportation while also allowing them to work.\nFederal courts struck down an expansion of DACA and the creation of similar protections for undocumented immigrants whose children are U.S. citizens.\nYoung immigrants, civil rights groups, universities and Democratic-led cities and states sued to block the administration. They persuaded courts in New York, San Francisco and Washington, D.C., that the administration had been \"arbitrary and capricious\" in its actions, in violation of a federal law that requires policy changes to be done in an orderly way.\n"

        "title": "Pentagon official testifies Trump directed freeze on aid to Ukraine",
        "text": "Laura Cooper, the top Pentagon official overseeing U.S. policy regarding Ukraine, told House impeachment investigators last month that it was her understanding that President Donald Trump had directed the relevant agencies to freeze military aid to Ukraine over the summer, according to a transcript of her testimony released Monday.\n\"My secondhand understanding on this was that OMB [the White House Office of Management and Budget] wanted to communicate the president's direction to hold the assistance, and in consultation with the DOD [Department of Defense] comptroller they realized that the way to do this would be via an apportionment, this, you know, piece of guidance about the flow of funds that would tell us to hold,\" she said of the matter, according to the transcript.\nCooper testified that she came to this understanding in part from Michael Duffey, an associate director for national security programs at OMB, who she said conveyed in a meeting on July 26 that assistance funds from the Department of Defense and the State Department \"are both affected by this hold and that it relates to the president's concerns about corruption.\"\nDespite not usually having conversations with OMB officials, Cooper testified, she said she spoke with Duffey about a deadline to obligate the funds.\n\"He wanted more information on the precise nature of how long does it take to obligate, and how many cases, and that sort of thing. And I'm not a comptroller, so I referred him to the comptroller and to DSCA [the Defense Security Cooperation Agency],\" she said, according to the transcript. \"And it was my understanding that throughout the month of August there were many such conversations where OMB was trying to see if we could push, you know, keep planning to obligate, but keep pushing the obligations until later in the year and still complete them.\"\nCooper, during Oct. 23 testimony before the three House committees leading the impeachment inquiry into Trump's Ukraine dealings, also said that she had been told Trump had repeatedly expressed concerns about Ukraine and military aid to the country \u2014 weeks before the aid was frozen.\nCooper told impeachment investigators that she and other Pentagon officials had answered questions about the Ukraine assistance in the middle of June \u2014 so she was surprised when one of her subordinates told her that a hold had been placed on the funds after an interagency meeting in July 18.\n\"I got, you know, I got a readout from the meeting \u2014 there was discussion in that session about the \u2014 about OMB [Office of Management and Budget] saying that they were holding the Congressional Notification related to\" Ukraine, Cooper testified, according to the transcript.\nCooper, according to the transcript of her testimony, described the hold as \"unusual.\"\nCooper said that she attended a meeting on July 23, where \"this issue\" of Trump's \"concerns about Ukraine and Ukraine security assistance\" came up. She said in that meeting, the president's concerns were \"conveyed\" by acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney.\nAsked by lawmakers if the president was authorized to order that type of hold, Cooper said there were concerns that he wasn't.\n\"Well, I'm not an expert on the law, but in that meeting immediately deputies began to raise concerns about how this could be done in a legal fashion because there was broad understanding in the meeting that the funding \u2014 the State Department funding related to an earmark for Ukraine and that the DOD funding was specific to Ukraine security assistance. So the comments in the room at the deputies' level reflected a sense that there was not an understanding of how this could legally play out. And at that meeting the deputies agreed to look into the legalities and to look at what was possible,\" she said, according to the transcript.\nAt the next meeting with national security personnel, she said she told attendees \"there were two legally available mechanisms should the President want to stop assistance\" \u2014 a presidential rescission notice to Congress or for the Defense Department to do \"a reprogramming action.\"\n\"But I mentioned that either way, there would need to be a notification to Congress,\" she said, according to the transcript.\nAsked if that happened, Cooper said, \"That did not occur.\"\nIn all the relevant inter-agency discussions, Cooper testified, it wasn't just Defense Department officials who believed the aid should flow to Ukraine.\n\"It was unanimous with the exception of the statements by OMB representatives, and those statements were relaying higher level guidance,\" she said, according to the transcript.\nInvestigators have zeroed in on the testimony of several key figures in the Ukraine affair \u2014 including Bill Taylor, the top U.S. diplomat in Ukraine, and George Kent, a deputy assistant secretary of state who worked on Ukraine and five other countries \u2014 to support the allegation that the Trump administration froze aid intended for Ukraine as part of an attempt to pressure the country to open probes that would benefit Trump politically.\nThe freeze on military aid to Ukraine \u2014 which Cooper's testimony corroborates \u2014 is a crucial part of the narrative that Democrats have woven together in attempting to prove that the president sought a quid pro quo with Ukraine.\nHer testimony backed up key testimony from other figures involved in the affair, including from Taylor, who testified in October that Trump directed officials to tie military aid to Ukraine to demands that the country open politically advantageous probes.\nTaylor, in fact, specifically said he and others \"sat in astonishment\" as a White House Office of Management and Budget official said during a July 18 inter-agency call that Trump had ordered a hold on military assistance to Ukraine, according to the transcript of his testimony.\nTop Republicans, including Trump himself, have said there couldn't have been a quid pro quo because, they claim, the Ukrainians were not aware that military aid was being withheld in the first place.\nHowever, Cooper testified that she had concluded from conversations she'd had with Kurt Volker, the then-U.S. special envoy to Ukraine, and Taylor, that that couldn't possibly be true.\n\"I knew from my Kurt Volker conversation and also from sort of the alarm bells that were coming from Ambassador Taylor and his team that there were Ukrainians who knew about this,\" she said, according to the transcript.\nCooper also testified that there was a concerted effort within the executive branch to try to get the president to lift the hold.\n\"My sense is that all of the senior leaders of the U.S. national security departments and agencies were all unified in their \u2014 in their view that this assistance was essential, that we could work with the government of Ukraine to tackle corruption, and they were trying to find ways to engage the President on this,\" Cooper said.\nShe said she discussed the frozen aid with Volker on Aug. 20.\n\"So in that meeting he did mention something to me that, you know, was the first about somehow an effort that he was engaged in to see if there was a statement that the government of Ukraine would make that would somehow disavow any interference in U.S. elections and would commit to the prosecution of any individuals involved in election interference. And that was about as specific as it got,\" she said.\nThe transcript of Cooper's closed-door testimony was just the latest document made public as the probe moves to a new phase. House Democrats last week released transcripts of testimony from Taylor, Kent, Volker, U.S. Ambassador to the European Union Gordon Sondland and ousted U.S. ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch.\nThe testimony of those key figures have largely established a narrative that suggests the Trump administration sought to tie the nearly $400 million in military and security aid to Ukraine as well as the prospect of a coveted White House meeting to demands that Volodymyr Zelenskiy announce probes into former Vice President Joe Biden and his son Hunter Biden and a conspiracy related to the 2016 election.\nIn a statement, the chairs of the three committees leading the inquiry \u2014 House Intelligence Committee Chair Adam Schiff, D-Calif.; House Foreign Affairs Committee Chair Eliot Engel, D-N.Y.; and House Oversight Committee acting Chair Carolyn Maloney, D-N.Y. \u2014 said Cooper testified that Trump \"through the Office of Management and Budget, directed the freeze on hundreds of millions of dollars of critical military aid for Ukraine, against the judgment of career officials in the Department of Defense, Department of State, and other relevant agencies.\"\nThey also said that she had \"raised concerns, as did others on several occasions, to senior U.S. government officials about the legality of withholding the congressionally-authorized money, and the challenges that White House delays would put on spending it.\"\nCooper's testimony was delayed by five hours after a group of House Republicans who don't sit on the committees that questioned her stormed the secure room where her deposition was taking place."

        "text": "Opponents of a plan to build a campus for a policy institute in the Santa Monica Mountains say it sets a dangerous precedent for commercial development in a fire-prone area, while its backers say it is more environmentally sensitive than the large estate homes that would otherwise be built.\nBillionaire Nicolas Berggruen is seeking to develop the Berggruen Institute campus on 450 acres originally zoned for 28 single-family homes. The institute has agreed to preserve nearly 95% of the privately-owned property as open space and to create new public access hiking trails.\nThe proposed project in Brentwood includes a one-story, 109,880-square- foot main building with an additional 21,000 square feet of residential quarters for scholars-in-residence and visitors. Three pavilions totaling 30,000 square feet are also proposed. Construction will stay within the footprint previously approved for housing, according to a project brochure.\nThe proposal is subject to a multi-year environmental review process that has only just begun, but some residents of a nearby gated community are already upset about the plan. The Mountaingate Open Space Management Association is urging city planners to deny the institute's application for development and will present its objections to the Brentwood Community Council on Wednesday.\nThe association argues that the think tank should not be characterized as an educational institution -- a designation that relaxes zoning restrictions -- and that the development will create security, traffic and fire issues.\nThe definition of educational institution is designed to cover publicly funded colleges and universities or those offering academic instruction prescribed by the state, according to a statement released by MOSMA.\nSteve Soboroff, a Berggruen Institute LA Committee member and senior project advisor -- though better known as a member of the Los Angeles Police Commission -- says an educational institution is exactly what is envisioned.\n\"The Berggruen Institute will be -- first and foremost -- a campus for scholarly study,\" Soboroff said in an email to City News Service.\nThe Berggruen Institute was founded in 2010 in Los Angeles and is dedicated to \"engaging great thinkers to develop and promote long-term answers to the biggest challenges of the 21st century,\" according to the organization's website.\nThe institute's academic and research work is supported through partnerships with public and private academic institutions -- including USC, UCLA, UC Berkeley and Stanford -- and includes efforts to reform California's state and local government and address issues including economic inequality and climate change.\nThe development's detractors also says that the recent Getty Fire should be a wake-up call reminding community leaders of the risks posed by building in a high-risk fire zone.\nSoboroff said former Los Angeles Fire Department Chief Bill Bamattre has been enlisted by the institute to develop a fire safety plan with a goal of improving upon current safety conditions. He also pointed out that during the Getty Fire, Los Angeles city firefighters used the institute's private hydrants and roads to help battle the blaze.\nThe Berggruen Institute buildings will be at least a football field away from the closest house in Mountaingate and Berggruen himself has no plans for a home there, according to a letter Project Director Chris Kiley sent to local residents.\n"

        "text": "The jury in the criminal trial of U.S. President Donald Trump's adviser Roger Stone ended its first day of deliberations on Thursday without reaching a verdict on whether he lied to Congress about his efforts to learn more about when WikiLeaks would publish damaging emails about 2016 Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton.\nThe jury in federal court in Washington asked the judge two questions related to evidence and wording in one of the criminal counts against longtime Republican political strategist and self-confessed \"dirty-trickster\" Stone. The jury is set to resume deliberations on Friday.\nStone, 67, has pleaded not guilty to seven counts of obstruction, witness tampering and making false statements in testimony during the House of Representatives Intelligence Committee's investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. elections.\nWitness tampering carries a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison. The other counts carry a maximum sentence of five years each. If Stone is convicted, under U.S. sentencing guidelines he would likely face much less jail time as a first-time non-violent offender.\nProsecutors accused Stone of telling lawmakers five different lies related to the WikiLeaks website and its founder Julian Assange. WikiLeaks released a series of damaging emails about Clinton, Trump's Democratic rival in the presidential election that U.S. intelligence officials and Special Counsel Robert Mueller later concluded had been stolen by Russian hackers.\nSome of those lies relate to the existence of certain texts or emails, while others pertain to Stone's conversations with Trump campaign officials and a supposed \"intermediary\" with WikiLeaks in early August 2016.\nIn his Sept. 26, 2017 testimony Stone told the committee his intermediary was a journalist and he did not wish to out his source without permission. Then in an Oct. 13 letter to the panel Stone identified Randy Credico, a radio host and comedian, as being his intermediary in early August 2016.\nProsecutors say Credico was not actually talking to Stone about WikiLeaks during that time, and in fact Stone's true source was conservative author Jerome Corsi, whom Stone had previously dispatched in an email to \"get to Assange!\"\nThe jury of nine women and three men includes an Internal Revenue Service civil tax attorney, an employee of the AARP and a former congressional candidate.\nIn closing arguments on Wednesday prosecutors told jurors that Stone lied to Congress in order to protect Trump's image.\nStone's lawyers counter that such a motive makes no sense, because by the time Stone testified to the House Intelligence Committee in September 2017, Trump was already president.\nOn Thursday afternoon, the jury sent the judge a note asking whether the Oct. 13 letter identifying Credico as his intermediary can be considered \"testimony\" to Congress.\nJudge Amy Berman Jackson, in discussing the question with prosecutors and defense lawyers, said the jury seemed confused because the obstruction charge against Stone covers a broader array of alleged misdeeds, including testimony he gave and letters he submitted to Congress.\nHowever, the five false statement counts against Stone only refer to the testimony Stone gave on Sept. 26, 2017, and not to subsequent communications with Congress.\nJackson ultimately sided with Stone's defense by sending back a simple answer: \"No.\"\nThe letter is not considered to be \"testimony.\"\nThe jury also sought clarification on count three of the indictment by asking whether Stone was being charged with lying to Congress about having one intermediary, or if he was being charged for lying about the identity of the intermediary whom he named as Credico.\nJackson re-read the jury the precise language of the charge but declined to go beyond that."

John Ratcliffe, R-Heath and the main witness, U.S. diplomat William Taylor, that ended with the intervention of panel Chairman Adam Schiff, D-Calif.\nThe vote to subpoena the whistleblower for a closed-door deposition failed 13\u20139 along party lines.\nBut Conaway, of Midland, succeeded in keeping the whistleblower issue front and center.\nSome Republican supporters of Trump have advocated naming the whistleblower publicly and Schiff pointedly warned members not to attempt to do that during the televised hearings.\nCastro, of San Antonio, took on a Republican argument that has gained traction recently that no crime was committed because military aid to Ukraine that had been withheld was later released and Ukrainian officials did not conduct an investigation of former Vice President Biden \u2014 a Democratic presidential frontrunner \u2014 and his son to please Trump.\n\"So, we have a president who the other side has claimed or has defended the president saying that the aid went through and that there was never any investigation, but the president attempted to get those things done and it looks like there was an initial agreement by the president of Ukraine to actually do those things. So, ambassador, is attempted murder a crime? Is attempted murder a crime?\" asked Castro.\nTaylor replied, \"attempted murder is a crime.\"\nCastro listed other attempted crimes, stopping at \"extortion and bribery.\" While Taylor demurred from saying such an attempt was a crime, saying he did not know, Castro appeared to make his point that a U.S. president should not try to force a foreign leader to help on a personal matter in return for congressionally-approved assistance.\n\"I thought his questions were masterful,\" said Glenn Smith, an Austin-based Democratic consultant, of Castro. \"Trump supporters are in kind of a bind. How can they say that an American president can seek foreign intervention in an election on his behalf?\"\nRatcliffe, a former prosecutor, said that Ukrainian officials did not know that U.S. military aid was being held up so that Trump's request for a \"favor\" as he said on a telephone call with the president of Ukraine, did not amount to a \"quid pro quo.\"\n\"So, in this impeachment hearing today, where we impeach presidents for treason or bribery or other high crimes, where is the impeachable offense in that call?\" asked Ratcliffe. \"Are either of you here today to assert there was an impeachable offense in that call? Shout it out! Anyone?!\"\nTaylor had said in his opening statement that he was not taking a position on impeachment. When Ratcliffe would not give Taylor time to respond, Schiff stepped in and said he could answer.\n\"Mr. Ratcliffe, I would just like to say that I'm not here to do anything having to do with the [decision] about impeachment,\" Taylor said, \"That is not what either of us are here to do. This is your job.\"\nU.S. Rep.

        "text": "Several prominent Democrats have called for the resignation of White House senior adviser Stephen Miller following the publication of a report on a trove of emails in which he promotes a range of white nationalist content and ideas.\nThe progressive civil rights organization Southern Poverty Law Center on Tuesday revealed that the group had obtained messages sent by Miller to the conservative website Breitbart News in 2015 and 2016 that, according to the SPLC, \"showcase the extremist, anti-immigrant ideology that undergirds the policies he has helped create as an architect of Donald Trump's presidency.\"\nThe report sparked a strong reaction from Democrats on Capitol Hill, headlined by Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., who circulated a petition demanding his immediate ouster from the White House, where he has served as one of Trump's closest advisers, particularly on immigration policy, since his inauguration.\n\"Stephen Miller has repeatedly peddled white nationalist conspiracy theories, pitched nativist stories to Breitbart reporters, and worked together with right-wing leaders like Richard Spencer,\" the petition reads. \"This man cannot serve in the White House. Sign your name to demand his resignation immediately.\"\nSeveral candidates vying for the Democratic presidential nomination also chimed in from the campaign trail. Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., called Miller's views \"a danger to the American people.\" Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., said his ongoing involvement in U.S. immigration policy is \"evil.\" And former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Julian Castro reportedly called him \"a shame to our nation.\"\nMiller has not commented publicly on the matter, but earlier this week, White House press secretary Stephanie Grisham issued a statement that dismissed the report and criticized the SPLC.\n\"The SPLC ... is an utterly-discredited, long-debunked far-left smear organization that has recently been forced - to its great humiliation - to issue a major retraction for other wholly-fabricated accusations,\" Grisham said. \"They libel, slander, and defame conservatives for a living. They are beneath public discussion.\"\nThe Southern Poverty Law Center maintains an evolving list of approximately 1,000 alleged \"hate groups\" operating throughout the United States. Several groups on the list have blasted the organization for political bias, and some have sued to have the hate-group label removed. In 2018, the SPLC publicly apologized and paid out $3.4 million to political activist Maajid Nawaz for including him on its anti-Muslim extremist list in 2016.\nThe emails were provided to SPLC by Katie McHugh, a former Breitbart editor who was fired by the site in 2017 and has since publicly renounced her own ties to the so-called alt right.\nOver many months of correspondence, while serving as an aide to then-Sen. Jeff Sessions prior to joining the Trump campaign, Miller appears to have regularly sought to influence Breitbart's news coverage.\nIn July 2015, McHugh told SPLC, Miller called her to discuss aggregating a recent article about interracial crime published by American Renaissance, an alleged white nationalist publication, and later followed up on that conversation via email.\nOn Sept. 6, 2016, Miller suggested including a reference to \"The Camp of the Saints,\" a novel by French author Jean Raspail that is reportedly popular among white nationalists, in Breitbart's immigration coverage.\nAnd on Oct. 23, 2015, while discussing whether a recent hurricane could drive refugees into the United States, Miller sent McHugh a link to an article published on vdare.com.\n"

        "text": "A federal judge on Monday dismissed President Donald Trump's lawsuit to prevent the House Ways and Means Committee from utilizing a recently passed New York law providing the panel an avenue to pursue his state tax returns.\nJudge Carl Nichols of the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia ruled that his court was not the proper jurisdiction to sue the New York officials named in the lawsuit, leaving open the option that Trump do so in New York.\nIn his lawsuit, Trump sued to preemptively block the House Ways and Means Committee from requesting the returns, New York Attorney General Letitia James from enforcing the law, and to stop the New York Department of Taxation from furnishing the documents. Trump argued his lawsuit was necessary to prevent his state returns from being disclosed to Congress before a court could hear his opposition.\nThe House Ways and Means Committee, chaired by Rep. Richard Neal, D-Mass., has not requested Trump's state returns through the new New York law.\n\"Based on the current allegations, Mr. Trump has not met his burden of establishing personal jurisdiction over either of the New York Defendants,\" Nichols, a Trump appointee, wrote. \"The Court therefore need not reach the question of proper venue. Accordingly, the New York Defendants' Motion to Dismiss is granted, and Mr. Trump's Amended Complaint is dismissed without prejudice as to them.\"\nNichols also ruled that Trump did not sufficiently establish a conspiracy between the House Ways and Means Committee and the New York defendants, which would have strengthened his case for the lawsuit to be heard in Washington. Trump had argued that New York officials were \"co-conspirators\" with Democrats in Washington, and thus the Washington court had jurisdiction.\n\"But nowhere in his Amended Complaint does Mr. Trump allege the existence of a conspiracy; in fact, the word 'conspiracy' does not even appear in his pleadings,\" Nichols wrote.\nSoon after, Trump's personal attorney Jay Sekulow said the president's lawyers \"are reviewing the opinion.\"\n\"The case against the Ways and Means Committee proceeds in federal court,\" he added in a statement.\nJames said in a statement that her office is \"pleased with the court's conclusion.\"\n\"We have never doubted that this law was legal, which is why we vigorously defended it from the start and will continue to do so,\" she said.\nIn his lawsuit, Trump's attorneys argued that the state law was simply an effort to get information about his personal finances to embarrass him politically. It asked the court to provide a declaratory judgment that the House Ways and Means Committee \"lacks a legitimate legislative purpose for obtaining the President's state tax information.\"\nThe New York law, called the TRUST Act, was signed into law in July and allows the chairmen of three congressional tax-related committees \u2014 the House Ways and Means Committee, Senate Finance Committee and Joint Committee on Taxation \u2014 to request the state returns of public officials only after efforts to gain access to federal tax filings through the Treasury Department have failed. Neal is the only Democrat who can use the law, which was written broadly and makes it easier for New York to turn over the state tax returns of certain public officials to Congress.\n\"The dismissal of the President's frivolous lawsuit against the New York TRUST Act moves us closer to finding what it is he has fought so hard to hide from the public,\" Democratic New York Assemblyman David Buchwald, who sponsored the legislation, said in a statement.\nThe legislation states that any \"legitimate task\" of Congress is a valid reason to make the request, should efforts to obtain the returns at the federal level be stonewalled by the Treasury Department. New York state tax filings are not identical to the federal returns, but contain much of the same information.\nNeal's committee is tied up in separate legislation over Trump's tax returns with the Treasury Department, which has refused to provide Trump's federal returns to the panel. Neal sued the IRS and the Treasury Department over the returns citing a section of tax law that states the Treasury secretary \"shall furnish\" to congressional tax committees \"any return or return information\" request by its chairman.\nThe stated purpose of Neal's request is to review the IRS process for auditing presidential returns.\nWhen asked about the New York law in June, Neal said utilizing it could harm his case involving Trump's federal returns. In July, Neal said House counsel was \"reviewing\" the New York law and had \"some legitimate concerns\" regarding it.\nTrump is engaged in several legal battles across the country to keep his tax returns private. Last week, a federal appeals court ruled in a separate case that his returns must be turned over to Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance, who had subpoenaed the documents from Trump's accounting firm as part of an investigation into the pre-election payoffs to two women who alleged affairs with Trump. Trump is appealing that decision to the Supreme Court.\nTrump broke with four decades of tradition when he refused to release his returns during his presidential bid, citing an IRS audit \u2014 one he now undergoes annually as president. However, such an audit would not preclude him from releasing the returns, which he did pledge to make public during his 2016 run."

        "title": "Trump Impeachment Inquiry Delves into Idea of Quid Pro Quo",
        "text": "At the heart of the House impeachment inquiry into President Trump's Ukraine dealings is a Latin term that is easy to translate but legally difficult to define and prove.\nDemocrats beginning public hearings next week with three key witnesses are focused on whether Mr. Trump engaged in an inappropriate quid pro quo. Specifically, they are probing the president's temporary withholding of hundreds of millions of dollars in foreign aid to Ukraine, allegedly to pressure the country into opening investigations related to Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden and the 2016 election.\nA quid pro quo\u2014literally \"something for something\" or \"one thing for another\"\u2014is often associated with political corruption, but it isn't synonymous. And determining when a quid pro quo is unlawful or just hardball politics has been one of the most contentious areas of criminal law.\nTo successfully impeach the president, Democrats don't necessarily have to connect the Ukraine controversy to a specific crime. Charging the president with a more general abuse of power likely suffices under the constitution's definition of impeachment, legal scholars said.\nWere President Trump's dealings with Ukraine an abuse of power or an acceptable political horse trade? Join the conversation below.\nBut how federal courts have handled quid pro quos in the past offers a window into how the impeachment inquiry could unfold for Mr. Trump and what arguments his supporters and critics will deploy.\nThe key bribery offenses in the federal criminal code generally require evidence of an unlawful quid pro quo. That has been defined by the courts as an \"official act\" or \"formal exercise of governmental power\" traded for money or anything of value.\nSome legal scholars point to Section 201(b)(2) of the federal criminal code as the most relevant offense. Some legal commentators have suggested the president may have run afoul of campaign-finance laws, but the quid-pro-quo allegations represent more serious claims of misconduct.\nThe bribery statute makes it a crime for a public official to corruptly demand or seek \"anything of value personally\" in return for \"being influenced in the performance of any official act.\"\nApplying that statute, the allegation would be that the president (the public official) sought dirt on a political rival (the thing of value) in exchange for releasing aid (the official act).\nMr. Trump has denied any quid pro quo and called the impeachment inquiry a hoax. Several witnesses, including the U.S. ambassador to the European Union, have laid out evidence that security aid to Ukraine was linked to investigations sought by Mr. Trump.\nThe fact that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky denied feeling pressure from Mr. Trump during their July phone call isn't exonerating, and nor is the fact that the aid was suspended only temporarily and released without any probes into the Bidens and Burisma Group, a Ukrainian gas company where Mr. Biden's son, Hunter, had sat on the board.\nGenerally, a quid pro quo doesn't need to be successful or explicitly spelled out to be unlawful. And there is no requirement that both the giver and recipient of a bribe have a corrupt intent.\nBut other factors cast doubt on the criminality of Mr. Trump's dealings with Ukraine. For one, it isn't clear that an investigation into Burisma Group would constitute \"anything of value\" under the law.\nA thing of value exchanged for an official action doesn't have to be a good or service with a clear price tag. Judges have broadened the scope to include more intangible items, such as conjugal visits for a federal prisoner.\nBut legal experts can't point to any case law where a government investigation was deemed a thing of value in a corruption prosecution.\nAt the same time, courts in recent years have drawn sharper lines between ordinary political horse-trading and corrupt schemes. A series of Supreme Court rulings\u2014such as the 2016 overturned conviction of former Virginia Gov. Bob McDonnell\u2014have narrowed the scope of bribery statutes and made it harder for prosecutors to prove a politician broke the law.\n\"Existing corruption statutes are ill-equipped to address the type of conduct the president was alleged to have committed,\" said Luke Cass, a white-collar defense attorney in Washington, D.C., and a former federal prosecutor.\nSkeptics of the House impeachment inquiry into Mr. Trump have also questioned whether the president had a corrupt intent\u2014a required element of a quid-pro-quo crime\u2014in his interactions with Mr. Zelensky. Kenneth Starr, who led investigations of former President Bill Clinton, said in a podcast last month that the number of people listening in on the July 25 call suggests Mr. Trump wasn't trying to hide his actions. \"That goes to his intent. There is no corrupt bargain,\" Mr. Starr said. Other defenders say even if a quid pro quo happened, such presidential political skulduggery isn't without precedent in recent times.\nSen. Lindsey Graham (R., S.C.), chair of the Senate Judiciary Committee, has also argued that the Trump administration's Ukraine policy was too incoherent to be criminal. Other defenders say the president's sweeping executive authority over foreign affairs makes it more difficult to allege a criminal quid pro quo.\nA quid pro quo could be undefined in the criminal code but at the same time be a troubling abuse of power, said Stanford criminal law professor David Alan Sklansky. Then the question would be whether Mr. Trump's foreign policy put his private interests above the nation's.\n\"Just because something isn't a crime doesn't mean it's not an impeachable offense,\" said Mr. Sklansky.\n"

Yovanovitch, the ousted ambassador to Ukraine, testified in deeply personal terms about how she felt \"threatened\" by Mr. Trump after it emerged that he had told President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine that she was \"bad news\" and would \"go through some things.\"\nMr. Jordan, apparently working to avoid appearing to bully her, treaded relatively lightly in addressing Ms. Yovanovitch. He reserved his tart tongue for the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, Representative Adam B. Schiff, who tried to force the Ohio congressman to wrap up his questioning as he blew through the five-minute limit.\n\"My indulgence is wearing out,\" Mr. Schiff said.\n\"Our indulgence wore out with you a long time ago, Mr. Chairman,\" Mr. Jordan shot back. A rumble emerged from the audience, which uttered a collective \"Oooooh.\"\nMr. Jordan was installed on the intelligence panel at the last minute by Representative Kevin McCarthy, the Republican leader, so that he could take a prominent role in the public questioning. He and other Republicans on the panel spent part of Thursday in \"murder boards\" \u2014 mock hearings \u2014 to prepare.\n\"It's just like adding a pinch-hitter or a relief pitcher,\" Mr. McCarthy said in an interview.\nWith polls showing the public deeply split on whether Mr. Trump deserves to be impeached, and views hardening along party lines, Mr. Jordan is unlikely to change any minds. But for now, his presence on the panel is assuaging the Republican base, which is looking for someone tough to go up against Mr. Schiff, Democrat of California, a strait-laced former federal prosecutor.\n\"I think it is helpful in a setting dominated by Schiff to have somebody who's willing to be the equivalent of a middle linebacker in football,\" said Newt Gingrich, who was speaker during the impeachment of President Bill Clinton. \"He's willing to plunge in and make the tough case, and do it in very understandable language.\"\nTechnically, Representative Devin Nunes, the ranking Republican on the intelligence panel, is Mr. Schiff's counterpart. But during weeks of closed-door depositions, Mr. Jordan, the top Republican on the House Committee on Oversight and Reform, took the lead in questioning witnesses.\n\"If you didn't know better, you would think he was a prosecutor,\" said Representative Steve Scalise, the No. 3 House Republican.\nA former state legislator and law school graduate who never took the bar, Mr. Jordan is a two-time N.C.C.A. Division 1 wrestling champion in the 134-pound (lightweight) class. He rarely wears a suit jacket, and his failure to don one on Wednesday drew the attention of Robin Givhan, the fashion critic for The Washington Post.\n\"It's his power move,\" she wrote. \"His sartorial chest thump.\"\nBut Mr. Jordan seemed unable to rattle Mr. Taylor, a seasoned diplomat with a full head of gray hair and a stentorian voice that evoked memories of Walter Cronkite.\nReading Mr. Taylor's own testimony back to him, Mr. Jordan reminded the witness that he had said it was his \"clear understanding\" that Ukraine would not receive nearly $400 million in military aid from the United States until Mr. Zelensky announced the investigations. That is the essence of Democrats' case that Mr. Trump abused his power.\n\"Now with all due respect ambassador, your clear understanding was obviously wrong, because it didn't happen,\" Mr. Jordan said sharply, going on to note that Mr. Zelensky never made such an announcement and that the aid was ultimately released. (He neglected to say that Mr. Trump released it under pressure from lawmakers on Capitol Hill.)\n\"So I'm wondering, where'd you get this clear understanding?\" Mr. Jordan said, wrapping up. Mr. Taylor was unbowed: \"As I testified, Mr. Jordan, this came from Mr. Sondland,\" he said, referring to Gordon D. Sondland, the ambassador to the European Union and an ally of Mr. Trump.\nMr. Jordan, in a brief interview, said he was simply trying to get at the truth \u2014 at least as Republicans see it.\n"

        "text": "President Donald Trump suggested Friday that a U.S. diplomat was responsible for Somalia's descent into chaos decades ago, distorting her record.\nDemocrats branded his tweet witness intimidation.\nTrump's attack on Marie Yovanovitch came as she testified to the House Intelligence Committee about her service as U.S. ambassador to Ukraine and her dismissal by Trump.\nYovanovitch served as a low-level diplomat in Somalia in her first foreign tour after joining the foreign service in her 20s. She had nothing to do with the 1984 famine that preceded her arrival in Somalia and contributed to that country's unraveling, nor anything to do with the government's collapse and the onset of anarchy after she left.\nAnd while she served in Somalia, she had decidedly limited influence in a junior post.\nTRUMP: \"Everywhere Marie Yovanovitch went turned bad. She started off in Somalia, how did that go?\"\nTHE FACTS: There's no credence to the notion that countries \"turned bad\" when Yovanovitch went to them.\n\"I don't think I have such powers, not in Mogadishu and Somalia and not in other places,\" she said when asked about Trump's tweet.\nOf the seven countries where Yovanovitch served U.S. interests, five were designated hardship posts. In that sense, they were \"bad\" to begin with.\nMogadishu, Somalia, was her first tour after she joined the foreign service in 1986. She was a general-services officer with little clout, before she moved to other countries in increasingly senior positions.\nThe Somali civil war began in earnest in 1988, leading to a collapse in law and order by 1990, the overthrow of the government in 1991 and eventually to the ill-starred, U.S.-led United Nations peacekeeping intervention in 1992.\nBy then, she had moved on. After several years in Somalia, she went to Uzbekistan to help open the post-Soviet-era U.S. Embassy in Tashkent.\nAfter a series of promotions from both Republican and Democratic administrations, Yovanovitch worked from 2001 to 2004 as the U.S. deputy chief of mission in Ukraine before being named ambassador to Kyrgyzstan, then to Armenia.\nShe took over in Kyrgyzstan during a turbulent time in the Central Asian country. In what became known as the Tulip Revolution, protesters drove out a president they accused of corruption and he fled to Russia.\nThe new president, under pressure from Russia, threatened to expel the U.S. from a military air base that was being used to support the war in Afghanistan. But the U.S. reached an agreement with Kyrgyzstan during her ambassadorship that allowed U.S. troops to stay.\nYovanovitch arrived in Armenia in the fall of 2008, several months after the government had violently cracked down on protests that followed a contentious presidential election. Her efforts to push for the fair treatment of jailed protesters led her colleagues to choose her for a State Department award given to an ambassador who shows extraordinary commitment to defending human rights.\nShe returned to Ukraine after President Barack Obama nominated her to be U.S. ambassador in 2016.\nTRUMP: \"Then fast forward to Ukraine, where the new Ukrainian President spoke unfavorably about her in my second phone call with him. It is a U.S. President's absolute right to appoint ambassadors.\"\nTHE FACTS: His description of appointment powers is problematic \u2014 ambassadors must be confirmed by the Senate. But he's correct that Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskiy criticized the former U.S. ambassador in his July 25 phone call with Trump.\nHe did so after Trump called Yovanovitch \"bad news.\"\n\"It was great that you were the first one who told me that she was a bad ambassador because I agree with you 100%,\" Zelenskiy said, according to the rough White House transcript. \"Her attitude towards me was far from the best as she admired the previous president and she was on his side. She would not accept me as a new president well enough.\"\nTrump followed up by saying, \"Well, she' s going to go through some things.\"\nYovanovitch testified that she took those remarks, made two months after she had left the post, as a threat against her by the president.\nPresidents do not have the \"absolute right\" to appoint ambassadors. The Senate must approve them. But presidents can fire them at will.\n"

        "text": "Republicans have no unified argument in the impeachment inquiry of Donald Trump , in large part because they can't agree on how best to defend the president \u2014 or for some, if they should.\nThat would require a level of consensus that Trump's call with the Ukraine president was \"perfect,\" as he insists. Or it would take a measure of GOP independence from Trump to suggest there may be a need to investigate.\nInstead, it's every Republican for himself or herself.\nUtah Sen. Mitt Romney says the president's actions toward Ukraine are \"troubling.\" Other Republicans say the behavior may raise concerns, but it's not impeachable.\nSouth Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham calls the whole impeachment inquiry \"B.S.\"\nThe result is a mishmash of GOP commentary spilling from Capitol Hill that may shield lawmakers, for now, from risky political choices, but leaves them with a disjointed defense of Trump as impeachment hearings push into the public realm this coming week.\n\"It's not good,\" said veteran GOP strategist Alex Conant. \"Normally you want to establish the facts, get them out on their own terms, and build a message around that strategy. They're not doing any of that.\"\nHe added: \"It's hard to rally people to your side without a coherent and sustainable message.\"\nEarly on, as the White House ceded the PR strategy to the president, Republicans in the House and Senate parted ways as they confronted the political threat posed by the Democrats' impeachment investigation.\nAs far back as mid-October, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., gathered his GOP colleagues in private and offered them advice on impeachment.\nMcConnell told Republican senators their best bet was to calibrate their own message about the impeachment inquiry to fit their political situation, according to two people familiar with the private meeting who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss the closed-door session.\nWith a Power Point presentation, McConnell outlined the process ahead if the investigation moves to a vote in the House and trial in the Senate. But when it came time to broach what Republicans should say about impeachment, McConnell showed a preference for saying as little about it as possible.\nMcConnell suggested a couple of options. Senators could say they disagreed with the House process, he said, or they could simply say that as potential jurors in an eventual impeachment trial they wouldn't discuss it, according to the people familiar with the meeting.\nIt was the kind of political advice one would expect from the risk-averse leader as he tries to insulate his 53-seat GOP majority, including several senators up for reelection in 2020 in states such as Maine and Colorado where voters are split on Trump.\n\"That's what a good leader does \u2014 gives them the flexibility they need to respond. My problem is, given how egregious the president's conduct is, he's given them a pass,\" said Jim Manley, a veteran Democratic strategist.\n\"Most of these folks have got to know that what the president's doing is wrong, but they've made a cold-hearted, political decision right now it's best to stick with the president,\" he said.\nAt its core, the impeachment inquiry is based on what Democrats say is an improper quid pro quo \u2014 a \"shakedown\" \u2014 that Trump engaged in during his July 25 phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelesnkiy.\nAccording to a White House rough transcript of the call and testimony from several government officials, Trump was withholding needed military aid the East European ally as he wanted Zelenskiy to investigate Trump's potential 2020 rival, Joe Biden, as well 2016 U.S. election interference.\nIn the House, where congressional district boundary lines have been drawn in a way that leaves Republicans barely exposed to voters with centrist or left-leaning views, GOP leaders are mounting a more fulsome, if shifting, defense of Trump.\nGOP leader Kevin McCarthy of California says the president did nothing wrong on the call with Zelenskiy, and Trump's top allies in the House, including Ohio Rep. Jim Jordan, the top Republican on a committee conducting the impeachment inquiry, are leading the daily arguments against Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., and the Democrats.\nJordan is seen as the \"chief messenger\" for Republicans, said one senior House GOP aide who was not authorized to publicly discuss the strategy and spoke on condition of anonymity.\nThe House Republican message against impeachment has four distinct parts, according to this aide: The transcript of Trump's call with Zelenskiy shows the president did nothing wrong; several key witnesses testified that they don't have firsthand knowledge of what transpired; the Ukrainians didn't know the military aid was being upheld until it was publicly reported; and eventually the U.S. agreed to send the money to Ukraine.\nIt's a message being reinforced daily in the media by Jordan and other Trump surrogates, including Reps. Mark Meadows, R-N.C. and Lee Zeldin, R-N.Y., who are also part of the inquiry panels, the person said.\nWhat goes without saying, though, is that few Republicans lawmakers are willing to say the call was \"perfect\" or that there was \"no quid pro quo,\" as Trump insists.\nMore often, they say a little of this, a little of that.\n\"There are perfectly appropriate quid pro quos and there are inappropriate quid pro quos,\" offered Sen. John Kennedy, R-La. \"Just saying that there is a quid pro quo, at least based on my analysis of the evidence that I've seen so far, is a red herring.\"\n"

        "text": "Illinois Senate President John Cullerton said Thursday he plans to retire in January, ending a roughly four decades-long career in the General Assembly and setting the stage for a fierce battle among Democrats over his successor.\n\nCullerton's retirement has been \"heavily negotiated\" with his wife, and will allow him to spend more time with his family and practicing law in Chicago, he said in an interview with the Tribune.\n\n\"Now's the time,\" Cullerton said.\n\nCullerton told the members of his caucus his retirement plans Thursday evening after the Senate adjourned for 2019.\n\nCullerton, 71, has been the Senate president since 2009 and was elected last year to a four-year term from his Northwest Side Chicago district. He also won reelection to the Democratic State Central Committee for the 5th Congressional District last year. Talk of his retirement first surfaced in 2018, prior to his formally seeking reelection.\n\nSign up for The Spin to get the top stories in politics delivered to your inbox weekday afternoons.\n\nThe reaction from members of the Senate Democratic caucus was \"surprise and emotion,\" Cullerton said. \"On my part, anyway, and some of theirs too. And then some of them are probably thinking about their campaign.\"\n\nCullerton said he will not take part in choosing his successor.\n\n\"I am absolutely not going to be involved in campaigning, nor will I vote for my successor,\" Cullerton said. \"So I want to make sure that the rest of the folks who are going to be here and working with he or she make that decision.\"\n\nSenate Assistant Majority Leader Don Harmon said Cullerton's announcement \"certainly caught us all by surprise.\"\n\n\"He's done a remarkable job in his tenure as Senate president, and I think many of us were counting on him being around for a few more years,\" Harmon said.\n\nAsked if he is seeking to be the next Senate president, Harmon said he plans to talk to some of his colleagues soon \"and see what the mood is.\"\n\nOther senators likely to seek the top job include Kimberly Lightford of Chicago, also a member of Cullerton's leadership team; Tony Munoz of Chicago, who has long sought the post but faces some internal political opposition; Heather Steans of Chicago; Andy Manar of Bunker Hill; Melinda Bush of Grayslake; Elgie Sims of Chicago; and Emil Jones III, the son of Cullerton's predecessor as Senate president.\n\nKnown for his quick and sometimes not so subtle wit, Cullerton was viewed as the more personable and public half of the Democratic legislative leadership in Springfield that he shares with veteran Illinois House Speaker Michael Madigan.\n\n\"I've been elected Senate president, but she's the speaker of my house,\" Cullerton often said of his wife, Pam. At his 2017 swearing-in as Senate president, he joked that his wife, asked the secret of their long relationship, responded, \"We're both in love with the same man.\"\n\nCullerton was an avid advocate of restricting smoking and was instrumental in raising the state's cigarette tax by $1 a pack as part of a funding package for public works programs. Cullerton also was a longtime supporter of motorcycle helmet laws, but could not get that done in the face of an avid anti-helmet constituency throughout exurban and rural areas of the state.\n\nCullerton was often viewed as more politically pragmatic than Madigan, and sought to overcome the historic budget and ideological impasse that developed between the House speaker and then-Republican Gov. Bruce Rauner.\n\nCullerton called the two-year budget stalemate under Rauner \"nearly as ridiculous as it is frustrating\" and pledged to work with then-Senate Republican Leader Christine Radogno of Lemont to settle the feuding.\n\nBut Cullerton's efforts to reach a \"grand bargain\" failed when Rauner undercut Radogno's leadership and politically threatened rank-and-file GOP senators.\n\n\"I'd be the first to complain that we, the Senate, don't get the credit or attention that we deserve,\" he said in 2017. \"That could be because we tend to cooperate rather than tear each other apart. And too often if there's no conflict, there's no coverage.\"\n\nThe position of Senate president is one of the top four leadership positions in the Illinois legislature, but holds tremendous power in the chamber in terms of advancing political agendas. That's particularly true for Democrats, who hold a 40-19 supermajority over Republicans in the chamber.\n\nBut the position has sometimes been viewed as subservient to House speaker under Madigan, who has ruled his chamber since 1983 with the exception of two years in the mid-1990s when Republicans gained control.\n\nThat secondary-status role was in evidence during Blagojevich's tenure, when he used that view to enlist then-President Emil Jones to try to advance his agenda against Madigan. Madigan, along with House Republicans, repeatedly led efforts to block initiatives from a governor of his own party.\n\nNow, with Democrats once again holding one-party rule, the dynamics of the office have changed and are certain to evolve with a new governor as well as a new Chicago mayor.\n\nCullerton's departure comes at a tumultuous time for the Democratic-controlled state legislature and his Senate. At least three of his members are involved in federal investigations, including one facing corruption charges.\n\nState Sen. Martin Sandoval stepped down as chairman of the powerful Senate Transportation Committee earlier this month following a federal raid on the Southwest Side lawmaker's state capitol office in September. At the time of the raid, Cullerton resisted calls for removing Sandoval, a member of his leadership team, from his chairmanship.\n\nAdditionally, state Sen. Tom Cullerton of Villa Park pleaded not guilty in August to federal charges of ghost payrolling on a union organizing job. He is a distant cousin of the Senate president.\n\nAnother member of the Senate president's leadership team, veteran state Sen. Terry Link of Vernon Hills has been identified by a Tribune source as a lawmaker cooperating with federal investigators in the case that led to bribery charges against former state Rep. Luis Arroyo, D-Chicago.\n\nArroyo resigned earlier this month, just days after being arrested on bribery and corruption charges that included agreeing to pay a state senator $2,500 a month in exchange for the senator's support of legislation that would benefit one of Arroyo's lobbying clients.\n\nMadigan spoke with Cullerton about his retirement this week, and congratulated him on a \"great career\" during his time in the Senate and earlier during his tenure in the House, Madigan spokesman Steve Brown said.\n\nOverall, the two longtime Democratic leaders \"had a pretty terrific partnership,\" Brown said.\n\n\"The state is better off because of his service,\" Brown said.\n\nGov. J.B. Pritzker called Cullerton \"a passionate advocate for improving Illinois \u2014 whether it was his focus on ending the scourge of youth smoking, dedication to fully funding education or efforts to advance critically needed infrastructure throughout the state,\" in a Thursday statement.\n\nCullerton led the Senate with \"honor and distinction,\" and it will \"forever be better as a result,\" Senate Republican Leader Bill Brady said in a statement.\n\n\"We may not have always agreed on how best to address the issues facing the state, but there can be no denying John always put the people of Illinois first,\" Brady said."

        "title": "Michael Bloomberg, Deval Patrick blindside Dem primary field",
        "text": "The center of the Democratic Party is throwing a fit.\nThe party's moderate wing has suddenly produced back-to-back threats of Michael Bloomberg and Deval Patrick entering the presidential primary, revealing its determination to have an imposing presence in a race shaped by unrestrained liberal policy prescriptions and candidates.\nThe two potential candidates are expressions of the deep concern voiced by Democratic Party insiders and donors that the moderate frontrunner in the race, Joe Biden, is flawed and in danger of losing to a progressive alternative, Sen. Elizabeth Warren.\nAt a bare minimum, Bloomberg and Patrick stand to complicate \u2014 and potentially lengthen \u2014 the campaign.\n\"The combination of Deval Patrick and Bloomberg entering the race blows up the primary,\" said Quentin James, executive director of The Collective, a super PAC that supports African-American candidates.\nBloomberg and Patrick would face long odds if they run \u2014 but each could unsettle the race in far-reaching ways.\nBloomberg, a billionaire, could swamp his competitors in Super Tuesday states with advertising and remain a force deep into primary season with his nearly unlimited resources. Patrick, a former governor, could cut into the field in two key early states, and have a significant impact on the consolidation of the black vote.\nBecause Patrick hails from Warren's home state, he has built-in name recognition in New Hampshire, which shares its biggest media market with Boston, potentially sapping Warren and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders of their neighboring state advantage there.\nPatrick. Massachusetts' first and only African American governor, could also threaten former Vice President Joe Biden's sizable lead with black voters, particularly in South Carolina. And he could prevent the two other black candidates in the race, California Sen. Kamala Harris and New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker, from growing their support with African-American voters.\nYet the late timing of both Bloomberg's and Patrick's potential runs \u2014 now less than three months before the Iowa caucuses \u2014 leaves the prospects for either man dim, according to conversations with a dozen Democratic strategists.\nBloomberg doesn't have the same fundraising mountain to climb as Patrick. But as a 77-year-old white man, he faces demographic challenges in a party primary where his absurd wealth is as much a liability as an asset.\nBloomberg, who was already prepared tospend $500 million to help unseat President Trump this year, would join a contest where another billionaire, Tom Steyer, has failed to gain much traction despite spending at least $32 million in the early states of Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada and South Carolina since July.\nIf he runs, Bloomberg has signaled he might skip the first four early states in favor of competing in the 15 states that vote on Super Tuesday on March 3. That strategy gives him one narrow path to the nomination: Spend heavily and hang on until the field narrows to two or three candidates.\nDemocratic strategists view the outspend-and-outlast strategy as highly unlikely to succeed. The Super Tuesday electorate awaiting Bloomberg includes several Southern states where a high percentage of the Democratic vote will be cast by African Americans. And it includes Texas and California, two massive states with significant non-white populations \u2014 all potential liabilities for Bloomberg. His national polling, which is more reflective of Super Tuesday electorate than an early-state vote, is dismal.\n\n\"I saw Michael Bloomberg said he wants to run for president, I rolled my eyes and went back to reading about college football,\" said Chris Lippincott, a Texas-based Democratic strategist who ran a super PAC opposing Sen. Ted Cruz last year. \"It's too late. We do not have a dearth of quality candidates \u2026 I don't know anybody who looks at the debate stage and says, \u2018God, you know what we really need is another white guy.' If we needed another white billionaire, Tom Steyer would be doing better.\"\nOr as Jennifer Palmieri, the former Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton campaign adviser put it, \"Skipping the early states was [former New York Mayor Rudy] Giuliani's strategy in 2008. It didn't work for Giuliani, but it may be that the Bloomberg folks have also concluded that is their only path.\"\nPatrick, meanwhile, is relatively unknown outside New England and would have to raise millions of dollars quickly while raising his national profile.\n\"Both of their strategies are questionable,\" said Matt Bennett of the center-left group Third Way, who worked on Wesley Clark's late entry into the 2004 campaign. \"I have experienced the unbelievable scramble of trying to stand up a presidential campaign and join a race that is already sprinting forward, and it is very, very hard.\"\n\"In Bloomberg's case,\" Bennett said, \"he can spend his way to a place in the race, though I think it is too late. I think he missed his moment. With Governor Patrick, I don't know how he does it, because he doesn't have the money.\"\nBloomberg, who had decided in March not to run because of Biden's perceived strength, changed his mind last week because he believed the former vice president wasn't strong enough in the primary. A similar sense beset Wall Street and hedge fund donors from Massachusetts who favor Patrick, who works at a private equity fund but governed one of the most Democratic states in the nation.\n\"The possibility of a Bloomberg and/or Patrick entering into the race at this stage is a sign of that moderates in our party are concerned about Biden and his ability to capture the nomination,\" said Andrew Gillum, a Patrick friend from Florida who has spoken to the former governor about the contest.\n\"In Patrick's case, many see him as being able to weave together the progressive and moderate wings of the Democratic Party to win not only the nomination, but also the presidency,\" Gillum said.\nGillum's shares an adviser with Patrick, Rosy Gonzalez, who has been helping Patrick decide what he does next.\nAnother adviser who has spoken to the former governor about the presidential race said big donors are ready to give. \"Patrick could raise $10 million quickly and do some real damage in New Hampshire,\" the adviser said.\nTo make the debate stage in December, though, he would need to register 6 percent in two early state polls or somehow scrape together 200,000 donors, both difficult scenarios.\nBiden's supporters and advisers maintain that rival campaigns and potential candidates have badly underestimated him for months. He remains the frontrunner in most national polls despite constant fire from the right and left. Biden's team also points to polling showing that not only do centrists in the party like him, but that the overwhelming majority of Democrats are satisfied with the field.\n\"The miscalculation made about our campaign is that his support is an inch deep,\" an adviser said. \"People know Joe Biden. They like Joe Biden. You can't say the same thing for Michael Bloomberg. And Deval Patrick is a great guy. But what's his path?\"\n"

If the decision of the principal's supervisor is appealed, the superintendent's designee would be the final step. The designee would act on behalf of and with the delegated authority of the superintendent, according to the school system."

        "text": "Chad Wolf was confirmed to be the new acting secretary of Homeland Security on Wednesday, as a high rate of turnover continues to disrupt the agency's top ranks with several recent leaders serving mainly in temporary roles.\nWolf, now the fifth DHS chief in less than three years since President Donald Trump took office, succeeds Kevin McAleenan, who served as acting secretary since April before resigning last month.\nTwo Senate confirmed DHS secretaries and one acting chief served under President Barack Obama. President George W. Bush also had three DHS heads after the agency was created under his administration post 9/11.\nIn the debate over Trump's aggressive crackdown on immigrants, Democrats have been sharply critical of the agency, which oversees U.S. immigration enforcement and policy implementation.\n\"President Trump is intentionally circumventing Congress in order to install temporary leadership at DHS to further his cruel agenda against immigrant families and the Latino community,\" Congressman Joaquin Castro said Wednesday.\nThe president's far-right supporters and those who advocate for more restrictive immigration measures have been critical of Wolf, suggesting he wouldn't be willing to implement the president's most aggressive priorities. Before his time at DHS under former Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen, Wolf worked in government lobbying where he advocated for expansions of foreign worker visas.\nIn a move that could quell those concerns about his far-right credentials, Wolf announced that Ken Cuccinelli will serve as an acting deputy. As the head of U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, Cuccinelli has consistently advocated for Trump's immigration agenda before Congress and on television, and Trump's most conservative supporters have favored him for the acting secretary position.\nEncouraged by the decision to elevate Cuccinelli, RJ Hauman of FAIR -- a group that advocates for restrictive immigration policies -- praised Wolf's past work at Homeland Security but issued a warning of caution to the new leadership team.\n\"As new acting head of DHS, Wolf must never reward the business lobby's intentional disregard of American workers to maximize profits,\" Hauman told ABC News.\nCNN first reported the news of Cuccinelli's new role.\nAs Wolf was elevated to the cabinet-level position, USCIS -- a subsidiary of DHS -- unveiled a new plan to withhold work permits from asylum seekers who cross the border between ports of entry.\n\"Illegal aliens are gaming our asylum system for economic opportunity, which undermines the integrity of our immigration system and delays relief for legitimate asylum seekers in need of humanitarian protection,\" acting Cuccinelli said.\nA record-setting spike in illegal crossings occurred over the past year as immigration authorities blocked asylum requests at legal ports of entry. An enforcement procedure known as \"metering\" has restricted legal options for unauthorized immigrants waiting at ports since 2016. The practice has likely prompted more illegal crossing attempts, according to federal government inspectors.\nFelons and those guilty of certain misdemeanors, including driving under the influence, would also be ineligible for work permits under the new USCIS proposal.\nCuccinelli was asked at a Senate hearing Wednesday about why the employer verification systems don't always stop unauthorized immigrant labor. Pointing to the recent ICE raids at several Mississippi food processing plants where E-verify systems largely failed, the acting director said employers have started facing new \"consequences\" for not fully complying.\nUSCIS in September scrapped a requirement that the agency issue work permits within 30 days of receiving a valid application. The new proposal would allow the agency to take more time to issue the authorization forms."

        "text": "Mississippi Democrat Mike Espy announced Tuesday that he's running again for U.S. Senate against Republican incumbent Cindy Hyde-Smith, setting up a 2020 rematch of a race that churned up the state's painful racist history.\n\"I can and will do a better job for the people of Mississippi and the United States,\" Espy told supporters by email, after telegraphing the move for months.\nEspy is a former U.S. House member and former U.S. agriculture secretary. He lost the November 2018 special election to fill the last two years of retired Republican Sen. Thad Cochran's six-year term.\nHyde-Smith was Mississippi's agriculture commissioner when Republican Gov. Phil Bryant appointed her to temporarily succeed Cochran in the spring of 2018. She is the first woman to represent Mississippi in Congress.\nThe 2018 campaign was rocked by a video showing Hyde-Smith, who is white, praising a supporter by saying she'd attend a \"public hanging\" if he invited her. She called it an \"exaggerated expression of regard.\"\nThe comment made Mississippi's history of lynching a central theme in the campaign. Espy mentioned those remarks in his announcement video, emphasizing his pathbreaking role as Mississippi's first black congressman since Reconstruction.\n\"We can't continue the change we need if we have a senator who openly laughs about public hangings and makes statements supporting voter suppression,\" Espy said. \"Cindy-Hyde Smith is hurting Mississippi \u2014 our progress and our reputation \u2014 and we simply must replace her.\"\nIf elected, Espy would become Mississippi's first African American U.S. senator since Reconstruction. In the video, he says his great-grandparents were slaves brought to Mississippi from Georgia and Virginia. Their son, his grandfather, founded Mississippi's first hospital for African Americans.\nEspy says he wants to reduce poverty, make health care more affordable, increase well-paying jobs, improve schools and end President Donald Trump's trade war that's pressuring farmers financially.\nCandidates' qualifying begins Jan. 2, and Mississippi's U.S. House, Senate and presidential primaries are March 10. If primary runoffs are needed, they will be March 31, leaving a long stretch until the November general election.\nIt's unclear if Hyde-Smith will have any opposition in the Republican primary. During her time in office, Hyde-Smith has focused on rural issues and remained loyal to Trump.\nIn a statement released through her campaign spokesman, Hyde-Smith said she looks forward to discussing her vision to move Mississippi and the country forward.\n\"I'm proud to have helped lead efforts to transform our federal courts with conservative judges, improve border security, continue modernizing our military, and pass pro-growth policies that have created new jobs and better wages,\" Hyde-Smith said.\nEspy's announcement comes a week after Democrat Jim Hood lost the governor's race to Republican Tate Reeves, highlighting continuing weakness for Democrats in Mississippi. More voters turned out for the runoff between Espy and Hyde-Smith than for the 2019 general election, and other Democrats also lost badly in statewide races.\nAs he did in the 2018 campaign, Espy said he'll be independent and put Mississippi's needs over loyalty to a party.\n\"Too often, our current senator puts party over country instead of doing what's best for our state and even our national security,\" Espy said in his statement.\nEspy told The Associated Press in an interview Tuesday that he believes he can win by building a diverse coalition of voters. He said his campaign hired a firm to analyze which precincts can be flipped from Republican to Democrat.\n\"We're going after everybody \u2014 white, black, Democrat, persuadable Republican, persuadable moderates and those in the middle,\" Espy said. \"But I know where they are now. I'm not flying blind.\"\nTrump campaigned for Hyde-Smith in Mississippi in 2018, and he praised her when he held a rally Nov. 1 in Tupelo, days ahead of the gubernatorial election. Hyde-Smith was at that rally with Reeves and other Republicans.\n\"Cindy Hyde-Smith \u2014 she's incredible,\" Trump said. \"She's tough and smart and strong, and she's with us all the way.\"\nHyde-Smith is likely to have a substantial financial advantage over Espy. Federal Election Commission documents show Espy raised $100,000 through Sept. 30 and had $131,000 on hand, while Hyde-Smith raised nearly $1 million and had $583,000 on hand.\n"

        "text": "Behind closed doors, lawmakers and staff from both political parties have generally been cordial to their witnesses in the impeachment inquiry, thanking them for their government service and focusing on asking detailed questions more than on making assertions.\nThings grew more heated when televised hearings began Wednesday. With the cameras rolling, Republicans went on the offensive, aggressively questioning the first two witnesses to testify publicly after allowing their staff to take the lead when the same officials spoke behind closed doors last month.\nRep. Jim Jordan (R., Ohio) challenged diplomat William Taylor on how he obtained some of the information in his testimony, noting that he wasn't a firsthand witness to many of the events at the center of the probe into whether President Trump improperly held up aid to Ukraine and pressed the country to investigate 2020 Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden in exchange for the money.\nWhile Republicans had previously questioned Mr. Taylor about how much he was relying on others' accounts, Mr. Jordan on Wednesday made that a central point of his questioning. \"We've got six people having four conversations in one sentence, and you just told me this is where you got your clear understanding,\" Mr. Jordan told Mr. Taylor. \"I've seen church prayer chains that are easier to understand than this.\"\nRep. John Ratcliffe (R., Texas) demanded that the witnesses explain whether Mr. Trump committed an impeachable offense in a July phone call in which he asked Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate Mr. Biden and the 2016 election.\n\"Where is the impeachable offense in that call?\" Mr. Ratcliffe asked. \"Are either of you here today to assert there was an impeachable offense in that call? Shout it out. Anyone?\"\n\"I'm not here to do anything having to do with, to decide about impeachment,\" Mr. Taylor replied, adding, \"This is your job.\"\nA comparison between the first televised hearing of the impeachment probe and the transcripts from the earlier depositions illustrates that the inquiry has entered a new phase. If the private briefings were the fact-finding period, the public portion\u2014conducted in a formal committee room, rather than a cramped basement\u2014showed Republicans and Democrats seeking to shape public opinion about Mr. Trump's actions and whether they merit impeachment.\nOn Wednesday, Mr. Taylor, the top American diplomat in Kyiv, and George Kent, the deputy assistant secretary of state for Europe and Eurasia, testified that they grew concerned that Mr. Trump sought to advance his political interests by withholding aid to Ukraine while pressing the country to launch investigations.\nAs in the closed-door interviews, staffers led the first round of questioning, with each party accorded 45-minute-long rounds. But on Wednesday, individual lawmakers also received five minutes to ask questions.\nRepublicans used that time to challenge the accuracy of the witnesses' recollections and interpretations of the president's actions. Democrats, meanwhile, sought to present their arguments about Mr. Trump's actions toward Ukraine.\n\"Listening to all the evidence, everything I've heard and read in this investigation, it seems to me that the president of the United States either committed extortion and bribery of a foreign official, or attempted extortion and bribery of a foreign official,\" said Rep. Joaquin Castro (D., Texas).\nThe inquiry touches on \"the future of the presidency itself, and what kind of conduct or misconduct the American people may come to expect from their commander-in-chief,\" House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff (D., Calif.) said in his opening statement.\nA handful of Republicans interjected at the beginning of the hearing to ask questions or voice complaints about the process, but there were no major disruptions to the public hearing.\nThat contrasted with one closed-door deposition on Oct. 23, when a Defense Department official's testimony was delayed while Republican lawmakers held a protest in the secure room where it was scheduled to be held.\nSome of the private interviews included discussions that witnesses appeared to consider beside the main point of their testimony. After lawmakers brought up the legal definition of quid pro quo during Mr. Taylor's closed-door testimony, the diplomat replied: \"I don't speak Latin.\"\nAlso behind closed doors, Rep. Devin Nunes (R., Calif.) at one point pressed Mr. Taylor about unsubstantiated theories that Ukraine, not Russia, interfered in the 2016 U.S. election, but ended the exchange after Mr. Taylor said he wasn't familiar with those claims. \"So I know you don't want to get involved in politics, but those are still just ongoing concerns of the Congress,\" he said. \"Thank you for your attendance today.\"\nRepublicans have accused Democrats of using the private depositions to avoid being transparent with the public and criticized the public hearings because Democrats chose the first witnesses. Three witnesses who are scheduled to testify next week were requested by Republicans.\nMr. Nunes said Wednesday to Mr. Taylor and Mr. Kent: \"It seems you agreed, witting or unwittingly, to participate in a drama.\"\nThose closed-door sessions were the subject of some public partisan bickering again Wednesday. In in exchange with Rep. Elise Stefanik (R., N.Y.) about the protocol for the public hearings, Mr. Schiff said: \"As the gentlewoman should know if she was present for the depositions\u2014\"\n\"Which I was,\" Ms. Stefanik interjected.\n\"For some of them, yes.\" Mr. Schiff replied."

Susan Collins was the sole Republican to oppose Menashi, a 40-year-old New Yorker who has never tried a case or argued an appeal.\nRepublicans and Democrats complained that Menashi failed to answer questions at his nomination hearing, and Collins joined Democrats in criticizing Menashi's record on a range of issues, including immigration, race, women's equality and LGBTQ rights.\nSenate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer of New York called Menashi a \"disgrace\" and ``one of the most contemptible nominees to come before the Senate\" in more than 20 years.\nAs a lawyer for Education Secretary Betsy DeVos, Menashi \"helped cook up an illegal scheme to use the Social Security data of students swindled by for-profit colleges in order to deny them debt relief,\" Schumer said, noting that a federal judge ruled the plan violated federal privacy laws.\nSchumer, who has railed against many judicial appointments by President Donald Trump, said Menashi stands out as extreme, unqualified and \"almost craven. If there was ever anyone who was too far, it's Menashi.\"\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., called Menashi an \"impressive nominee,\" citing his degrees from Dartmouth College and Stanford Law School, clerkships for federal judges including Supreme Court Justice Samuel Alito, and experience teaching and practicing law.\nOther Republicans were more skeptical.\nSenate Judiciary Committee Chairman Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., said Menashi \"has written some really weird stuff\" and is \"different than I would have chosen,\" but is qualified for the federal bench.\nGraham was one of several senators who expressed frustration at Menashi's refusal to answer questions about his record at the White House and the Education Department during his confirmation hearing in September.\nSen. Dianne Feinstein of California, the committee's top Democrat, said Menashi's silence made it difficult for senators to fulfill their constitutional role to provide advice and consent on presidential nominees.\nShe and other Democrats were especially unhappy about Menashi's role in denying debt relief to thousands of students swindled by for-profit colleges. \"Mr. Menashi should not be rewarded for providing such bad legal advice with a lifetime appointment to the federal bench,\" Feinstein said.\nMenashi's \"troubling record of undermining critical rights and questions surrounding his involvement in Secretary DeVos's shameful efforts to ignore the law\" disqualify him from a lifetime judgeship, added Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash.\nCollins said Menashi's past writings, particularly about women, LGBTQ advocates and racial diversity, raise questions about whether he has the appropriate judicial temperament.\nCollins, one of the most vulnerable GOP incumbents next year, said it was inappropriate for Menashi to refuse to answer questions about his work in the Trump administration during his confirmation hearing.\n\"His reluctance to answer questions about the family separation policy made it difficult for me to assess his record and impeded my constitutional duty to evaluate his fitness to serve as a judge,\" she said in a statement. \"After careful consideration ... I do not believe he is well-suited to serve on the federal bench.\"\nMenashi is among more than 150 federal judges nominated by Trump and confirmed by the Senate, including at least 46 appeals court judges. About one-quarter of federal appeals court judges were nominated by Trump.\n"

Critics, however, allege the report is being withheld until after the election because it is embarrassing to Johnson's Conservative Party, which is trying to win a majority and push through Johnson's Brexit plan to take Britain out of the European Union.\n\"I'm dumbfounded that this government won't release the report ... because every person who votes in this country deserves to see that report before your election happens,\" Clinton told the BBC on Tuesday. \"There is no doubt ... that Russia in particular is determined to try to shape the politics of Western democracies, not to our benefit but to theirs.\"\nFormer Special Counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into the 2016 U.S. presidential election found that Russia interfered in the vote in a \"sweeping and systemic\" fashion. U.S. President Donald Trump, who won that vote, has dismissed the Mueller report's conclusions, but the investigation has put Russia into the crosshairs of a debate on the integrity of elections worldwide.\nClinton also spoke about the British report with the Guardian newspaper as she promoted \"The Book of Gutsy Women,\" written with her daughter, Chelsea. The former U.S. Secretary of State said she wished she had been more \"gutsy\" in exposing Russian efforts to influence the 2016 U.S. presidential election.\n\"I am, as a great admirer of Britain, concerned, because I can't make sense of what is happening,\" Clinton told the Guardian. \"We have a president who admires dictators and takes their help and does all kinds of crazy stuff. So we need you to be the sane member of this partnership going forward.\"\nThe Intelligence and Security Committee began its investigation following allegations of Russian interference both in the 2016 U.S. election and the British referendum on the country's EU membership earlier that year.\nThe investigation began in November 2017, but the importance of the probe was highlighted in March 2018, when a former Russian spy and his daughter were poisoned with a chemical nerve agent in the cathedral city of Salisbury in southern England. Britain says Russian agents were behind the near-deadly poisonings, a charge that Russia denies.\nThe intelligence committee sent its report to Johnson for review on Oct. 17, saying it expected \"to publish the report imminently.\" Committee Chairman Dominic Grieve has criticized Johnson's government for failing to release the document amid media reports it has already been cleared by British security services.\nAmong those who gave evidence to the committee was Bill Browder, founder of Hermitage Capital Management. Browder worked in Russia until 2005 and has campaigned for sanctions against Russian President Vladimir Putin's government since 2009, when his lawyer died in a Russian prison. He told The Associated Press that by failing to release the Russian influence report, Johnson has made it worse for himself by implying there is something to hide.\n\"Nobody likes a cover-up,\" Browder said.\nLawmakers from a range of parties, including Johnson's Conservatives, urged the government earlier this month to publish the report during a debate in the House of Commons.\nForeign Office minister Christopher Pincher argued it was \"not unusual\" for such reviews to \"take some time,\" but others suggested the reasons are baldly political. The Sunday Times reported that nine Russian businesspeople who have donated money to the Conservatives are named in the report.\nThe Russian report comes amid increasing concerns about the security of an election fought in an increasingly digital world. Britain's election laws are woefully out of date, written more for a time when leaflets were pushed through mailboxes, not as Facebook and other social media giants publish political ads.\nFollowing an 18-month investigation into online privacy and the use of social media to spread disinformation, an parliamentary committee in February urged the British government to urgently approve new laws addressing internet campaign techniques, insisting that democracy itself was under threat.\nWhile the government agreed with many of the recommendations made by the Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Committee, it has done little other than circulate its own report for public comment. Former committee chairman Damian Collins said the government had planned to modernize Britain's electoral laws at the latest by 2022, the original date for the next general election.\nBut Johnson called an early election in response to the political turmoil caused by Britain's pending departure from the EU, which is scheduled for Jan. 31. So now Britain's 46 million eligible voters will be choosing 650 lawmakers in the House of Commons in the Dec. 12 vote.\nThe election campaign is already being fought online.\nThe Labour Party announced Tuesday that it had experienced a \"sophisticated and large-scale cyberattack\" on its digital platforms. The main opposition party says the attack did not succeed because of \"robust security systems\" and it had referred the matter to the National Cyber Security Centre.\nA source at the Centre told Britain's Press Association that the denial-of-service attack was relatively low-level with no evidence of \"state-sponsored\" activity. Such an attack aims to slow down access and cause websites to crash by flooding them with traffic.\nLabour leader Jeremy Corbyn, who was campaigning in Blackpool, still expressed dismay.\n\"If this is a sign of things to come in this election, I feel very nervous about it all. Because a cyberattack against a political party in an election is suspicious, something one is very worried about,\" he said.\nEarlier in the campaign, the Conservatives posted an altered video on Twitter and Facebook of a television interview with Keir Starmer, a senior Labour figure, that misleadingly showed him failing to answer a Brexit question when in reality, he did. The chairman of the Conservative Party called the doctored video a lighthearted satire, but it highlights the gray ethical area being exploited by the campaigns.\nSocial media companies have faced global scrutiny worldwide following allegations that political consultant Cambridge Analytica used data from tens of millions of Facebook accounts to profile voters and help Trump's 2016 election campaign.\n"

We developed a list of various names, terminology and iconography that has generated headlines across the political spectrum over the past few years. We then began a search throughout various malware repositories and discovered that not only were political names and iconography surprisingly common, but the results produced a wide variety of threats and was almost a microcosm of what we see on the threat landscape daily.\"\nDuring their search, the Talos Group discovered a ransomware called the \"Donald Trump Screen of Death\". This screen locker attempts to lock users out of Windows while showing them various pictures of President Trump. The Talos Group also found a program called the Trump Crypter which is used to obfuscate malware code so that it cannot be detected by security software.\nBack in 2016, a screen locker called \"CIA Election AntiCheat Control\" was discovered that showed a picture of Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump that told victims to send $50 or their vote in the upcoming election wouldn't count. Additionally, the Cisco Talos Group found a harmless program called Dancing Hillary that allowed users to make Hillary Clinton dance.\nFormer President Barack Obama's likeness was also used by malware developers to create an injector with an Obama theme. This injector can be used to inject malicious code into legitimate processes in an attempt to evade security software.\nHowever, malware developers also used the likeness of politicians outside the US to deliver their malicious payloads. For instance, Russian President Vladimir Putin was used as the theme for a number of infections including a screen locker called PuTiN Lockware that the Talos Group discovered. German Chancellor Angela Merkel was also used as the theme for a ransomware that made the rounds during 2016.\nAs the upcoming 2020 US election approaches, expect malware developers to create even more politically-themed ransomware in an effort to trick unsuspecting users.\n"

        "text": "White House acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney said Tuesday that he no longer plans to sue over the House impeachment proceedings and will instead follow President Donald Trump's directions and decline to cooperate.\nIt's the latest reversal in position by Mulvaney, who last week asked to join the lawsuit of another Trump adviser before changing his mind Monday and saying that he intended to bring his own case. It appears to resolve once and for all a four-day legal dispute that exposed divisions among current and former Trump administration officials about how best to respond to Democratic demands for cooperation and testimony.\nIn a court filing Tuesday, one day before the impeachment inquiry enters a critical phase of public hearings, Mulvaney said he no longer planned to ask a judge for guidance on whether he must cooperate with the House. He said he would rely on Trump's instructions \"as supported by an opinion of the Office of Legal Counsel of the U.S. Department of Justice, in not appearing for the relevant deposition.\"\nMulvaney had been subpoenaed to appear last week for a closed-door deposition before House impeachment investigators but did not show up.\nHouse Democrats had seen him as a potentially important witness, in part because he has publicly confirmed the contours of a quid pro quo arrangement in which the Trump administration would release military aid to Ukraine in exchange for the country announcing an investigation into Democratic rival Joe Biden. His name has also repeatedly surfaced in the testimony of other witnesses who have cooperated.\nAfter skipping his appearance, Mulvaney asked to join a lawsuit brought by Charles Kupperman, the president's former deputy national security adviser. That case, filed last month, asked a judge to decide whether Kupperman had to comply with a subpoena from the House or a competing directive from the White House that he not testify.\nMulvaney had argued that his circumstances were similar to that of Kupperman, but lawyers for both Kupperman and the House of Representatives opposed his request to join the suit and highlighted what they said were key differences, including the fact that Mulvaney has spoken publicly about the events at the center of the impeachment inquiry.\nU.S. District Judge Richard Leon said in a conference call on Monday that he was \"not inclined\" to grant Mulvaney's request.\nThe Justice Department legal opinion that Mulvaney references says close advisers to the president are immune from having to testify to Congress because \"preparing for such examinations would force them to divert time and attention from their duties to the President at the whim of congressional committees.\"\n"

Turkey claims the Kurdish group is an offshoot of the Kurdistan Workers' Party, which is designated as a terrorist group by both Ankara and Washington.\n\n\"I think the president has a great relationship with the Kurds,\" Trump said. \"Many Kurds live currently in Turkey, and they're happy, and they're taken care of, including health care \u2014 we were talking about it before \u2014 including health care and education and other things, so that's really a misnomer.\"\n\nThe question came from reporter Rahim Rashidi of the Iraqi Kurdistan network K24, who was dubbed \"Mr. Kurd\" by Trump during a press conference last year when discussing the fight against ISIS.

        "text": "Career U.S. diplomats delivered solemn testimony Wednesday about the Trump administration's alleged misconduct in Ukraine \u2014 including a previously undisclosed cellphone call in which President Donald Trump appeared to personally press a senior State Department official to pressure the Eastern European nation.\n\nAs the historic public impeachment proceedings got underway, the two witnesses described a scheme by administration officials and Trump's personal attorney, Rudolph W. Giuliani, to push Ukraine's president to launch investigations into Democrats in the U.S. that would help Trump in the 2020 election.\n\nGOP lawmakers worked to undermine the legitimacy of the hearings, and repeatedly noted that neither man had personally spoken with Trump and neither had firsthand knowledge of his motivations.\n\nThe stark divide \u2014 in Congress and among the broader electorate \u2014 over Trump's alleged misdeeds was on full display in the House hearing room. The committee members snapped at one another about the way Democrats were managing the proceedings and their decision to shield an anonymous whistleblower from public hearings.\n\nAs they did, the invited witnesses girded for a rough day.\n\nIntelligence Committee Chairman Adam B. Schiff, D-Calif., kicked off the hearing by expressing concern over Trump's admonishment that Democrats should drop the hearings.\n\n\"If we find that the president of the United States abused his power and invited foreign interference in our elections, or if he sought to condition, coerce, extort or bribe an ally into conducting investigations to aid his reelection campaign and did so by withholding official acts \u2026 must we simply \u2018get over it'?\" Schiff said, referring to a comment last month by Trump's acting chief of staff, Mick Mulvaney.\n\n\"Is that what Americans should now expect from their president?\" Schiff said. \"If this is not impeachable conduct, what is?\"\n\nCalifornia Republican Rep. Devin Nunes, ranking member of the Intelligence Committee, objected to how Democrats were running the impeachment inquiry.\n\n\"This is a carefully orchestrated media smear campaign,\" he said.\n\nThe dismissive posture of the GOP \u2014 toward Democrats and the witnesses \u2014 stood in contrast to the weighty testimony presented in opening statements by the diplomats, who outlined how the White House leveraged its power over a small nation to score political points at home.\n\n\"In mid-August, it became clear to me that Giuliani's efforts to gin up politically motivated investigations were now infecting U.S. engagement with Ukraine,\" said George Kent, a deputy assistant secretary at the State Department. \"I don't believe the U.S. should ask other countries to engage in selective politically associated investigations or prosecutions against opponents of those in power because such selective actions undermine the rule of law, regardless of the country.\"\n\nHis opening remarks were followed by those of William B. Taylor, the top U.S. official in Ukraine, who had previously outlined for investigators a shadow diplomacy effort in Ukraine led by Trump loyalists looking for political dirt. He recalled the text message he sent after learning that $400 million in sorely needed U.S. aid to Ukraine was being held up until Ukrainian officials agreed to announce the politically motivated investigations that Trump wanted.\n\n\"I wrote that withholding security assistance in exchange for help with a domestic political campaign in the United States would be \u2018crazy,'\" Taylor said. \"I believed that then and I believe it now.\" And Taylor also recalled sitting in \"astonishment\" when he first learned in a security briefing that the assistance had been put on hold.\n\nTaylor also revealed some of the only new information that emerged Wednesday, involving Trump's ongoing eagerness for Ukraine to open the investigations.\n\nTaylor recounted that, during a July 26 telephone conversation overheard by a member of his staff, Trump asked Gordon Sondland, U.S. ambassador to the European Union, about \"the investigations.\" It was the day after Trump personally pressed Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy to open investigations into former Vice President Joe Biden's son and false allegations that Ukraine interfered in the 2016 U.S. election.\n\nThe staff member, who was not identified by Taylor, then asked Sondland about the call.\n\n\"Ambassador Sondland responded that President Trump cares more about the investigations of Biden, which Giuliani was pressing for,\" Taylor said.\n\nTaylor told lawmakers he did not know of the incident when he gave a sworn deposition on Oct. 22.\n\nThe comment as relayed by Taylor is secondhand \u2014 a point made by Republicans in trying to undermine it. But it will probably also put even more heat on Sondland, who has changed his testimony during the course of the investigation and is due to testify publicly Nov. 20.\n\nRepublicans vacillated during the hearing between aggressively questioning the relevance of testimony from diplomats who did not have direct contact with the president, and pursuing lines of inquiry that seemed to muddle their defense of Trump.\n\nRepublican counsel Steve Castor challenged Taylor's account of the \"irregular channel of diplomacy\" Giuliani led on Trump's behalf by asking: \"It is not as outlandish as it could be, is that correct?\" The question drew a chuckle from Taylor, who responded that yes, it could have been even more outlandish.\n\nBut Rep. Jim Jordan of Ohio, a firebrand who was added to the House Intelligence Committee in recent days in preparation for the impeachment hearings, was more effective as he took aim at Taylor, mocking his standing as the Democrats' \"star witness.\"\n\nJordan tried to undercut Taylor's statement that he had a \"clear understanding\" that security assistance funding would not come until the president of Ukraine committed to an investigation into the Bidens and the 2016 election. He suggested the understanding rested on a lengthy exchange between Taylor, Sondland and several other people \u2014 not a direct line to the White House or a direct comment from Zelenskiy. Taylor met with Zelenskiy at three points during the time period in which the aid was held up \u2014 although not necessarily when the Ukrainians knew.\n\nJordan said it was surprising that Zelenskiy did not bring up the aid, \"even though you have three opportunities with President Zelenskiy for him to tell you \u2026 we're going to do these investigations to get the aid.\"\n\nJordan also pointed out that Taylor was not on the July 25 call at the center of the inquiry, and had never spoken to Trump or Mulvaney. And in later questioning, the Ohio congressman would make the case that withholding aid from Zelenskiy was sound policy, as the White House tried to sort out whether he was a true ally in the fight against broader corruption that had plagued Ukraine for years.\n\nEven in this era of political chaos and theatrics in Washington, Wednesday stood out for the intensity of the drama and what was at stake. Democrats were for the first time televising their case before a nation largely unfamiliar with the detailed evidence.\n\nIt was only the fourth time in the history of America that impeachment proceedings have been brought against a president. Trump started the day with a signature string of angry tweets, accusing Democrats of a \"witch hunt\" and the day's witnesses \u2014 who had notched years of service under Republican administrations \u2014 of being aligned with the \"never Trump\" movement. Both witnesses are career diplomats who have worked in both Republican and Democratic administrations.\n\nAt the center of the inquiry is the pressure Trump put on Zelenskiy to publicly launch an investigation into the Ukrainian business dealings of Biden's son, Hunter, during the Obama administration. As Trump and his surrogates demanded the investigation, the Trump administration withheld nearly $400 million in aid and delayed scheduling an Oval Office meeting Zelenskiy desperately sought.\n\nThe high stakes of the moment were top of mind on both sides of the aisle. A persuasive performance by Democrats on live television held the promise of pushing the large swath of voters currently undecided on impeachment into their corner. Such a shifting of public opinion would intensify pressure on GOP lawmakers to break with the White House.\n\nPublic airing of evidence loomed large in shifting voter opinions in the impeachment proceedings of both Richard Nixon and Bill Clinton.\n\nAmong the most damning witnesses Democrats have in their arsenal is Taylor, a Vietnam veteran who was first appointed ambassador to Ukraine by George W. Bush. He had threatened to resign over the White House pursuit of political dirt, warning it would embolden Russia. The West Point graduate took copious notes of everything he observed in Ukraine in a little green notebook.\n\nTaylor's background with the GOP makes it difficult for Republicans to brand him a tool of the Democrats.\n\n\"I am not here to take one side or the other,\" Taylor said Wednesday. \"Or to advocate for any particular outcome. \u2026 I am nonpartisan and have been appointed to my position by every president from President Reagan to President Trump.\""

While exact numbers were not provided, pre-orders have totaled \"well over 100,000 and climbing,\" according to a publishing world source.\n\nThe book promises to provide an inside account of what it will argue is Trump's unfitness for office from the same \"senior official\" who wrote an anti-Trump op-ed for The New York Times last year. Top editors at The Times said they knew the identity of the author, but granted the person anonymity to protect them from retaliation.\n\nThe writer says \"A Warning\" is meant to convince people that the president should not be re-elected.\n\nThe publication date is November 19.\n\nThe book has been at or near the top of Amazon's constantly-updated best seller list since it was announced last month. \"A Warning\" is No. 2 on that list as of Tuesday afternoon. Hachette's announcement on Tuesday backed up the Amazon ranking.\n\n\"We are very proud to publish this historic book that is already breaking records before its release. I think readers will find A WARNING to be a fascinating, detailed account,\" Twelve's publisher Sean Desmond said in a statement.\n\nThe publishing house previously said that 500,000 copies would be printed in anticipation of intense demand.

Anonymous has heard disturbing things. You, the reader, will already recognize most of what Anonymous has seen and heard as revealed in this book if you have been paying any attention to the news,\" Jennifer Szalai wrote in a review for The New York Times.\n\nStill, the preorder sales indicate that lots of people want to hear and see what Anonymous is alleging."

The Ethics Committee traditionally defers to law enforcement agencies while criminal cases are ongoing.\n\nSpano, a 53-year-old former Florida state legislator who was first elected to Congress in November 2018, has been under scrutiny for months over funds he loaned his campaign during last year's race. Spano claimed initially that nearly $175,000 he loaned his campaign came from personal funds. But it was later disclosed that Spano had received $180,000 in loans from personal friends.\n\nSpano's attorney sent a letter to the Federal Election Commission shortly after the election acknowledging that Spano had misreported the source of the funds and filed updated campaign-finance reports. Florida Democrats filed multiple complaints against Spano and urged House Democrats not to seat him in the new session of Congress, but he was sworn in on schedule.\n\nThe Office of Congressional Ethics submitted a request to the Ethics Committee in late September seeking a formal investigation into the Spano matter. The Ethics panel was evaluating the OCE recommendation, but it has now stood aside while the Justice Department conducts a criminal probe.\n\n\"Today, the House Committee on Ethics deferred their review of my self-reported filings with the FEC. We plan to cooperate fully with the Justice Department on this matter,\" Spano said in a statement released by his office.\n\n\"As I've said before, we acknowledged that mistakes were made with respect to the campaign loans, but those mistakes were completely inadvertent and unintentional. We were the ones who self-reported this to the FEC. We are confident that upon review, the Justice Department will see it that way, too.\"\n\nStrangely, Spano blamed the House's impeachment inquiry into President Donald Trump for the DOJ's criminal probe.\n\n\"I continue to have doubts about the timing and motive behind this inquiry, as the impeachment proceedings this week have shown me how far the left will go to destroy their opponents,\" Spano added. \"I remain committed to the issues that are important to my constituents.\"\n\nSpano's central Florida district is on Democrats' target list next year, though it leans Republican.

The meeting was organized by the Economic Development Council of Western Massachusetts, Springfield Works and Children's HealthWatch of Boston.\n\nAmong MassBudget's findings is that 20,932 Springfield tax filers benefited from the Earned Income Tax Credit in 2017, the most recent year for which data is available.

Barriers might include the potential loss of welfare benefits and the cost of child care in addition to a lack of skills or a lack of preparation for the job search and interview process.

Adam Schiff] and Speaker Nancy Pelosi are conducting this impeachment investigation is unprecedented, constitutionally questionable, and an affront to American fair play,\" Giuliani wrote of the two California Democrats in The Wall Street Journal.\n\n\"In an ideal America, politicians would be held to the same standard regardless of party, and this inquiry would be over. But the left's inability to accept the results of the 2016 election and fear of Mr. Trump's policy agenda have driven the Democrats into a frenzy,\" he added.\n\nAt the heart of the House's impeachment investigation is a July phone call between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in which Trump repeatedly lobbied his counterpart to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden, a chief political rival, on ungrounded corruption allegations. While the call has been the focus of bipartisan scrutiny on Capitol Hill, Giuliani maintained the president did nothing wrong.\n\n\"The conversation my client, President Donald J. Trump, had with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky on July 25 was innocent. During a congratulatory call, the newly elected Mr. Zelensky brought up the need to \u2018drain the swamp' in his country. Rooting out corruption was one of Mr. Zelensky's campaign pledges, and Mr. Trump asked him to investigate allegations of corruption at the highest levels of both governments. It was a matter of serious mutual concern,\" he wrote. \n\n\"Moreover, Mr. Trump requested that Ukraine root out corruption; he didn't demand it. His words were cordial, agreeable and free of any element of threat or coercion. Mr. Trump offered nothing in return to Ukraine for cleaning up corruption,\" Giuliani continued.\n\nThe op-ed comes a day before the House begins hearing public testimony in its inquiry into Trump. William Taylor, the top U.S. diplomat to Ukraine, and George Kent, a top State Department official, are set to testify Wednesday, while former U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch is expected to testify Friday.\n\nHouse Democrats launched their impeachment probe in September over concerns that Trump leveraged $400 million in military aid to Ukraine to pressure Kyiv to publicly launch an inquiry into Biden and 2016 election meddling. Several witnesses have testified privately that they were uncomfortable with Trump's request and that they believed there was a quid pro quo surrounding the president's dealings with Ukraine."

        "text": "The evidence against President Donald Trump is overwhelming.\n\nWitness after witness after witness in the House Democrat-led impeachment inquiry has outlined a clear quid pro quo in which Trump and his administration withheld US military aid from Ukraine in order to compel the new Ukrainian president to open investigations that would benefit Trump politically in the 2020 presidential election.\n\nAnd yet House Democrats are holding public hearings this week \u2014 prolonging the investigation and, crucially, a vote on whether or not to impeach the president.\n\nThe question, then, is why? Why continue the probe and commit to days of open testimony that will almost certainly devolve into a partisan political circus? Especially when some Democrats involved in the inquiry say they already have enough to impeach Trump?\n\nAccording to Democratic House members and aides I spoke to, there are two main reasons. First, they believe that the process of impeaching a president requires a completed probe. \"We have a responsibility to follow through with the full investigation,\" Rep. Joaquin Castro (D-TX), a member of the House Intelligence Committee that leads the inquiry, told me Thursday. Democrats, it seems, have yet to decide whether or not articles of impeachment against the president should be brought up.\n\nSecond, Democrats say they must hold hearings on camera so that the American people can see what investigators have already learned behind the scenes \u2014 and perhaps glean some new information. \"The importance of public hearings is to make the case to the American people,\" Rep. Ro Khanna (D-CA), a House Oversight Committee member involved in the inquiry, told me.\n\nThe open hearings, then, will serve as part ongoing examination, part public relations campaign before any steps are taken to impeach the president (or not). Which means the next few days and weeks will likely be particularly raucous, both on Capitol Hill and across the country.\n\nDemocrats say the benefits of open impeachment hearings outweigh the costs\nThe closed-doors hearings have uncovered an established, indisputable fact pattern: that there was a quid pro quo with Ukraine and that the president is implicated in it.\n\nBut Democrats I spoke with said that outside of Washington and the politicians, political junkies, and journalists obsessively following the nitty-gritty details of the investigation, most Americans are far less up to speed on what the investigation has uncovered.\n\nThe public hearings will give Democrats a chance to change that.\n\n\"Many of the Democrats who won seats in key districts have come out in favor of an impeachment inquiry, but they haven't endorsed impeachment,\" a Democratic congressional aide told me. \"There's a need to shore up support from people in their districts, and ideally put more pressure on Republican senators.\n\n\"Video and audio are powerful mediums for humans,\" the staffer continued. \"The facts of Watergate were well established, but it was the Nixon tapes that sunk him.\"\n\nYet some Democrats worry that prolonging the impeachment inquiry could lead to unnecessary stumbles. For instance, witnesses may not be as frank on camera as they were speaking behind closed doors in a Capitol Hill basement.\n\nStill, most Democrats say that the benefits outweigh the potential costs.\n\nThe open sessions will also introduce most members of Congress to the facts of the case. Only three House committees \u2014 Intelligence, Oversight, and Foreign Affairs \u2014 have participated so far, making the majority of lawmakers unfamiliar with what's been said in the closed testimonies. Giving them intimate familiarity with the quid pro quo evidence might steady them against skeptical constituents.\n\nFinally, most say Democrats just have a duty to keep the American people informed about something as consequential as impeachment. \"It's important that Americans hear the evidence for themselves directly from these witnesses,\" Castro told me.\n\nKhanna agrees: \"We have had the grand jury investigation phase where the evidence is overwhelming. Now we are in the trial phase to present that evidence simply and convince our fellow citizens and senators that the president compromised our national security and abused his office.\"\n\nThe timeline for wrapping the entire House impeachment drama is still in flux. But the consensus for now is to have open hearings done before the Thanksgiving recess \u2014 \"though that's not hard and fast,\" one staffer told me \u2014 and to hold a floor vote on articles of impeachment by mid-December. \"It'll partially depend on how hearings go next week,\" another Democratic aide said.\n\n\"Everyone's got a plan until they get punched in the mouth,\" the first staffer concluded.\n\nWhich means the sessions this week won't just serve as a political spectacle, they'll also be the compass for the direction the impeachment process is heading. That makes them even more consequential than they're already expected to be."

        "text": "Threatened with a lawsuit, Howell has extended its group housing moratorium yet again, this time until late February. \n\nAttorneys for a once-proposed sober living home for women argue that there are only three sober living homes in Howell, all of them for men, and the city's proposed new rules too strictly restrict potential new group homes. \n\nThe City Council voted unanimously Monday to extend the moratorium until Feb. 24, 2020 due to concerns raised by the Fair Housing Center of Southeast and Mid-Michigan about ordinances initially approved by the council in September. The moratorium, instituted in July 2018, was originally supposed to end Friday. \n\nMORE: Howell introduces ordinances to regulate transitional housing\n\n\"Just in general, there were concerns raised,\" said Tim Schmitt, Howell's community development director, on Tuesday. \"If you change one, it has an effect on the other.\"  \n\nThe concerns are very specific, according to letters sent to the city regarding the problems in the ordinances. \n\nAs written, the ordinances violate several federal discrimination laws, according to an Oct. 10 letter to Schmitt from Pam Kisch, executive director of the Fair Housing Center of Southeast and Mid-Michigan. \n\nThe city's proposed ordinances came about because of \"disability-based community opposition,\" according to an Oct. 3 letter from Stephen Dane, of the Washington, D.C.-based law firm Relman, Dane and Colfax PLLC that represents the Fair Housing Center of Southeast and Mid-Michigan. \n\nLast year, an application for a sober living home for women \u2013 the nonprofit Amber Reineck House \u2013 was applied for by Courtney Atsalakis to be located at 304 S. Walnut Street, but was later withdrawn due to concerns from neighbors. \n\nMORE: Proposed addiction recovery house sets neighborhood on edge\n\nA spokesperson for the Amber Reineck House declined to comment. \n\nThe law firm said a government making a decision about whether or not to allow group homes based on community opposition can violate the federal Fair Housing Act. \n\n\"They identify and categorize housing that will serve people with disabilities for specific unjustified burdensome restrictions, impose different zoning standards based solely on disability, and directly impede congregate group homes for people with disabilities like the Amber Reineck House from operating,\" Dane wrote. \n\nIn addition, the ordinances appear to restrict or eliminate the establishment of group homes rather than serving as a way to protect people with disabilities and to create more group homes across Howell, Dane wrote. \n\nDrug addiction, including an addiction to opioids, is a disability under Section 504 of the federal Rehabilitation Act, the Americans with Disabilities Act, and Section 1557 of the Affordable Care Act, when the drug addiction substantially limits a major life activity, according to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services' Office for Civil Rights. \n\nThe law firm alleges there are only three sober living homes in Howell \u2013 all for men \u2013 and there are few areas in the city where other sober living homes could exist. \n\n\"My understanding of all of the transitional housing facilities in Howell are for men only, but given that we have little to no data on the houses, I can't tell you that for 100% certain,\" Schmitt said. \n\nSchmitt said in September there were six \"transitional housing\" homes in the city. \n\nThe ordinance separates special housing accommodation uses and sober living homes into different categories, which the law firm says is discriminatory because there are only regulations for group homes for the handicapped, citing a 1995 federal case, Larkin v. State of Michigan Department of Social Services. \n\nThe law firm also says there are several instances of applications for sober living homes having to be subjected to more scrutiny than other homes. \n\nIt is also argued the proposed registry for sober living applicants is not legal and is discriminatory. \n\n\"None of the proposed requirements can be argued to protect health or safety of residents with disabilities; all seem extremely vague, or designed to burden the application process, or both,\" Duane said. \n\nWith the newest extension of the moratorium, a new public hearing will have to be held by the city Planning Commission. \n\nContact Livingston Daily reporter Sean Bradley at 517-552-2860 or at spbradley@livingstondaily.com.

But that's what he does. I think part of it is his own insecurity as an impostor. I think he knows full well that he's in that office way over his head, and so he has to diminish everyone else.\"\n\nEarlier Friday, Trump had launched a broadside against Marie Yovanovitch, the former U.S. ambassador to Ukraine, as she testified before the House Intelligence Committee. During the testimony, Yovanovitch, who was abruptly recalled from her post in the spring on orders from the White House, bluntly described the efforts of Rudy Giuliani, one of Trump's personal attorneys, to smear her and advance business interests in Ukraine.\n\n\"Everywhere Marie Yovanovitch went turned bad. She started off in Somalia, how did that go?\" Trump tweeted in real time as Yovanovitch testified, referring to her stint as an ambassador in that war-torn country.\n\nThe episode led to a strange moment during the hearing, in which Yovanovitch was asked by House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff to respond to Trump's tweet, which she wasn't aware of.\n\n\"I don't think I have such powers, not in Mogadishu, Somalia, and not in other places,\" Yovanovitch said haltingly. \"I actually think that where I've served over the years, I and others have demonstrably made things better for the U.S. as well as for the countries that I've served in.\"\n\nEven Republicans were critical of the tweet, which Democrats labeled \"witness intimidation.\"\n\n\"I disagree with the tweet,\" said Rep.

Some say that even if there was, it's not an impeachable offense. Republicans also call the process unfair, as the GOP can call defense witnesses only with majority Democrats' approval and the president's lawyer will not be allowed to participate in this phase.\n\nWhere to Watch\n\nWatch the hearings live on the Bloomberg Terminal at LIVE or streaming on the web at www.bloomberg.com. The Intelligence Committee will stream the video on YouTube here. PBS will carry the hearings live, as will C-SPAN3, C-span.org and C-SPAN Radio. NBC News, ABC News and CBS News plan to interrupt regular broadcasting with special reports on the hearings; CNN, Fox News and MSNBC plan more extensive airings.\nThe Witnesses\n\nTop U.S. envoy to Ukraine William Taylor and Deputy Assistant Secretary of State George Kent will testify on Wednesday.\nFormer U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch will testify Friday.\nTaylor has said that during his first several months in the post he grew increasingly concerned that Ukraine aid was being held hostage to White House demands for politically motivated investigations. He said he \"always kept careful notes.\"\nKent is significant because he testified that Trump \"wanted nothing less than President Zelenskiy to go to the microphone and say investigations, Biden and Clinton.\" He didn't directly speak to Trump about it, however.\nYovanovitch described Rudy Giuliani\u2018s activities in seeking an investigation of Biden and the events that led Trump to remove her from her job in the spring.\nAdditional hearings are expected next week.\nHearing Process\n\nThe House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence will conduct the hearings, taking the lead after closed-door depositions conducted with the Oversight and Foreign Affairs committees.\nThe hearing will follow rules set by a resolution approved Oct. 31 by the House, as well as by the House's standing rules.\nThe resolution gives Intelligence Chairman Adam Schiff and top Republican Devin Nunes, both of California, equal time in 90-minute rounds to question each witness, though they can hand over the questioning to committee staff.\nThe 20 other members of the Intelligence Committee will get five minutes each to question the witness per round. There may be multiple rounds.\nRepublicans have sought permission from Democrats to call at least nine witnesses. Already, Schiff has said he won't allow Biden's son Hunter or the anonymous whistle-blower to be called. Nunes has asked for State Department officials David Hale and Tim Morrison and former White House Ukraine adviser Kurt Volker to testify. Schiff may agree to these requests.\nKey Lawmakers\n\nSchiff, by releasing transcripts of testimony, created a steady flow of negative news about Trump and Ukraine over weeks of closed-door depositions. The public hearings will be a test for the chairman, who drew criticism for an earlier public hearing on Ukraine. He parodied Trump's call with the Ukrainian leader, giving the president an opening to say Schiff lied about the call.\nNunes is one of Trump's most staunch defenders in Congress. As Intelligence chairman during Republican control, Nunes had to turn the investigation into Russian interference over to colleague Mike Conaway after Nunes was accused of revealing classified information while defending Trump. He played a lead role in investigating the 2012 attack on a U.S. diplomatic mission in Benghazi, Libya, a probe that did political damage to Hillary Clinton before the 2016 election. Clinton was secretary of State at the time of the assault.\nHouse Republicans appointed Jim Jordan of Ohio to the Intelligence Committee so he can participate in the public hearings. Jordan, a combative House veteran, is the top Republican on the Oversight Committee and participated in the closed-door depositions.\nCalifornia Democrat Eric Swalwell emerged as an attack dog for the majority during numerous media interviews. Swalwell abandoned a presidential campaign earlier this year.\nKey Documents\n\nWilliam Taylor deposition transcript\nGeorge Kent deposition transcript\nMarie Yovanovitch deposition transcript is here and here\nRough White House transcript of July 25 conversation between Trump and Zelenskiy\nTrump's Plans\n\nTrump is scheduled to meet with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan during the first day of House hearings Wednesday. He's also sure to weigh in on the proceedings.\nNext Steps\n\nAfter completing the hearings, the Intelligence Committee is to send a report summarizing its findings to the Judiciary Committee. That could come later this month.\nThe Judiciary Committee then can hold public hearings, where Trump and his lawyers will be invited to attend, question witnesses and offer testimony. The committee would decide whether to draft articles of impeachment and vote on whether to send them to the full House for a vote to impeach the president.\nIf the Senate receives articles of impeachment from the House, it must immediately begin a trial. Senators would sit as a jury, listening to the case from House managers and the White House defense, with Chief Justice John Roberts presiding. A two-thirds majority is required to convict in the Senate, which Republicans control 53-47. Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has said that if the vote were held now, Trump would be acquitted.\nThe History\n\nOnly two presidents have been impeached by the U.S. House. Andrew Johnson was impeached in 1868 for firing his secretary of war over Congress's objections and for other decisions related to the reconstruction of the American South after the Civil War. Bill Clinton was impeached in 1998 for perjury and obstruction of justice related to his sworn statements related to his affair with White House intern Monica Lewinsky. Both were acquitted by the Senate.\nRichard Nixon resigned in 1974 after the House Judiciary Committee approved articles of impeachment related to the burglary of Democratic Party headquarters in the Watergate building and the subsequent cover-up. His advisers had warned him that impeachment and removal were likely.\nThe Trump inquiry differs from the Nixon and Clinton investigations because in those cases, the Judiciary Committee held hearings relying on evidence compiled and turned over by special prosecutors. In Trump's case, House committees conducted the investigation themselves."

He added that it connotes that the government is not legitimate. \"This is a very dangerous and indeed incendiary notion.\"\n\nMr. Barr spoke as the second public impeachment hearing wrapped up on Capitol Hill, where Democrats have accused Mr. Trump of abusing the power of his office for personal gain.\n\nMarie L. Yovanovitch, the former ambassador to Ukraine, testified that she was the target of a smear campaign engineered to get Mr. Trump to remove her; she was recalled from Kiev in the spring. She said that her dismissal from the post put national security at risk by opening the door for Russia to further influence Ukraine, a strategic American ally.\n\nShe also said that she felt devastated and threatened to learn that Mr. Trump had vilified her to Mr. Zelensky, testimony that Mr. Trump underscored by attacking her on Twitter as she sat before lawmakers.\n\nIn his address, Mr. Barr suggested the president has acted within his powers and that his opponents were willing to bend the law to stop him.\n\nMr. Barr is known as an executive power maximalist and a believer in the unitary executive theory, which posits that the Constitution imbues the presidency with broad powers that are subject to relatively little oversight.\n\nHe has argued, for example, that Congress cannot make it a crime for a president to exercise executive powers corruptly; and that presidents have authority over law enforcement investigations even when investigators are scrutinizing their activity.\n\nOn Friday, Mr. Barr hit back against criticisms of his view of executive authority.\n\n\"Some of you may recall when I was up for confirmation, all these Democratic senators saying how concerned they were about my adherence to the unitary executive theory,\" Mr. Barr said.\n\n\"This is not new and it's not a theory,\" Mr. Barr said, calling his viewpoint a straightforward description of the powers that the Constitution gives the president. \"Whatever the executive power may be, those powers must be exercised under the president's supervision,\" he said.\n\nMr. Barr's assessment was a \"highly contestable \u2014 and in my view, seriously mistaken \u2014 reading of history,\" said Peter M. Shane, a former Justice Department official and Ohio State University law professor who specializes in the separation of powers.\n\n\"He over-reads the vesting of executive power, ignores the limitations on executive power implicit in other clauses, and ignores evidence of what voters in favor of ratification would have expected from the text,\" Mr. Shane said. \"He is, indeed, a maximalist.\""

        "text": "As one of Rhode Island's big philanthropists, Thomas M. Ryan, the former CEO of CVS Health, has his name on many things.\n\nIn September, for example, he gave a gift of $35 million to his alma mater, the University of Rhode Island, where his name is already enshrined in the titles of academic programs and an athletic complex.\n\nThese days you can also find his name on documents as an investor in the booming cannabis industry.\n\nHe joins a one-time Republican gubernatorial hopeful, the retired CEO of Beacon Mutual Insurance, a Washington lobbyist, a hedge fund manager and some real estate developers \u2014 not to mention the parents of golfer Brad Faxon \u2014 as some prominent Rhode Islanders or those with local roots investing today in marijuana or its non-intoxicating cousin, hemp.\n\nRyan is listed in updated disclosure documents filed with the state on behalf of the Summit Medical Compassion Center, the Warwick medical marijuana dispensary headed by Terence M. Fracassa.\n\nRyan is a member of a new group of investors affiliated with one of Summit's spinoff companies called CanWell. The company specializes in extracting THC from marijuana and using the psychotropic compound in foods, snacks and oils.\n\nCanWell has said in court papers it hopes to become New England's leader in what's known in the marijuana industry as the \"alternative dosage\" market \u2014 other methods of using marijuana besides smoking.\n\nBesides Ryan, the investment group includes James Rosati, the retired president and CEO of Beacon; James S. Bennett, who ran for governor in 2002 and once headed the Rhode Island Convention Center Authority; and brothers Stephen and Gerald Harrington, a lawyer and Washington lobbyist and Democratic political fundraiser.\n\nStephen Harrington grew up in Rhode Island, works in the investment field in Philadelphia and summers in Narragansett. He said that many of the investment group's members have known each other for decades and see medical marijuana, in particular, as a worthy investment that can help people in need.\n\n\"We've had a family member who had cancer who required chemo[therapy] and relied on medical marijuana,\" said Harrington. \"The people we brought together are Rhode Island people. They understand this is a growth industry and they are committed to a best-practices approach.\"\n\nBennett, who in 2002 lost in the Republican primary for governor to Donald Carcieri and served as chairman of the state convention center between 2011 and 2015, said he joined the investment group last year.\n\n\"I have a daughter in the medical marijuana space in Florida who was keeping me up to date on the technology and benefits of it [medical marijuana], so I looked into it.\"\n\nBennett, who also served as Providence's economic development director under Mayor Angel Taveras, said he was impressed with reports that marijuana could be used to wean people off prescription drugs.\n\n\"Big tobacco, the pharmaceutical companies, they'll all looking to get in,\" he said. \"It seemed like a good, balanced investment.\"\n\nThe District of Columbia and 11 states \u2014 Alaska, California, Colorado, Illinois, Maine, Massachusetts, Michigan, Nevada, Oregon, Vermont and Washington \u2014 have legalized marijuana for recreational use. Thirty-three states, including Rhode Island, have medical marijuana programs.\n\nThe Marijuana Business Daily reported this summer that retail sales of medical and recreational cannabis in the United States were on pace to surpass $12 billion by the end of this year, an increase of about 35% over last year, and could rise to more than $30 billion by 2023.\n\nGerald Harrington founded the Washington lobbying firm Capitol City Group Ltd. in 1999. According to its website, he has been a major fundraiser for the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee and the Democratic National Committee.\n\nHe also raised money for Hillary Clinton's 2008 presidential campaign and served as a \"consultant\" for Rhode Island Senators Jack Reed and Sheldon Whitehouse.\n\nThe CanWell investment group also includes Joseph Healey, who, like several of its other investors, attended Bishop Hendricken High School in Warwick.\n\nHealey co-founded a $3-billion New York hedge fund known as Healthcor, which for 20 years has invested in pharmaceuticals and medical technology, says its website.\n\nIn 2016, The Journal wrote about how Healey hosted a concert by renowned rock star Lenny Kravitz at his Narragansett beach mansion Sandcastle-by-the-Sea. The concert, which marked Healey's 50th birthday, drew hundreds of guests and also raised money for the We Are Family Foundation, formed after the 9/11 terrorist attacks to promote cultural diversity.\n\nCompanies looking to expand in the cannabis market face a difficult challenge when raising investment capital.\n\nBecause the federal government still considers marijuana illegal, federally insured banks won't lend money to companies like CanWell. Instead, they have to raise private capital.\n\nSome major cannabis companies like Canada-based Acreage Holdings, with business interests in 20 states, have picked up big-name promoters like John Boehner, the former Republican speaker of the House of Representatives, and Bill Weld, a former Republican governor of Massachusetts. Weld ran for vice president on the Libertarian ticket in 2016 and is running for president as a Republican in 2020.\n\nBoehner has tweeted that the federal government needs to reclassify marijuana so more research is allowed on the drug, which could help veterans and possibly lower opioid addiction rates.\n\nNot all new local investors are big players like the kind CanWell has attracted.\n\nBrad and Eileen Faxon, the parents of the Barrington pro golfer, are also listed in documents filed with the state Department of Business Regulation as having a financial interest in Kelsey Green, a Warwick-based cultivation company yet to be fully licensed to operate, and a new affiliated company, Green Reservoir Inc.\n\nLast month, a lawyer for Green Reservoir threatened Rhode Island marijuana regulators with a lawsuit if the state doesn't begin accepting license applications immediately for six new medical marijuana dispensaries.\n\nGov. Gina Raimondo has said those lucrative licenses will be chosen through a fair lottery system \u2014 the process of which is now being drafted in new regulations.\n\nThe other branch of the cannabis business \u2014 hemp growing \u2014 is also drawing some familiar investors.\n\nHemp is a cousin of marijuana that produces little or no THC but is rich in cannabinoid (or CBD), now widely used for pain relief and insomnia.\n\nDeveloper Richard P. Baccari Sr., president of Providence-based Churchill & Banks, incorporated RI Hemp Farm at the end of last year and received a license to grow hemp in April.\n\nBaccari, who was acquitted in 2014 of paying three North Providence Town Council members a bribe as he pursued zoning changes for a supermarket, did not return telephone calls placed to his office."

        "text": "The only Democrat who filed papers to challenge Sen. Tom Cotton (R-Ark.) next year abruptly ended his campaign on Tuesday just hours after the filing deadline passed.\n\nIn a statement posted to Facebook and Twitter, Democratic candidate Josh Mahony said an unspecified \"family health concern\" meant he could no longer devote the time needed to run a competitive campaign.{mosads}\n\n\"It has been the honor of my life to be able to meet and visit with so many Arkansans over the last six months and hear their voices,\" Mahony said in the statement. \"It was my sincere hope to be their advocate in Washington, D.C. However, in this moment right now, I need to focus on my family and place their interests first.\"\n\nMahony, a nonprofit executive in Fayetteville, was mounting his second bid for public office. He lost a 2018 run against Rep. Steve Womack (R-Ark.) by an almost 2-to-1 margin. And his odds against Cotton were not good: Cotton won office in 2014 with 57 percent of the vote, easily defeating former Sen. Mark Pryor (D-Ark.).\n\nBut Mahony had raised about $250,000, according to campaign finance reports made to the Federal Election Commission last month. Those reports showed Mahony ended September with $25,000 in the bank.\n\nNo other Democrat had filed to challenge Cotton by Tuesday's midday deadline. Cotton still faces Ricky Harrington, a Libertarian candidate who works for the state corrections department, and Dan Whitfield, who calls himself a progressive independent.\n\nThe state Democratic Party told local media outlets it is working with the Secretary of State's office to figure out whether and how it can get a replacement candidate on the ballot. Michael John Gray, the Democratic chairman, told the Arkansas Democrat Gazette he learned of Mahony's exit when someone told him about the tweet."

        "title": "Movie nights, baseball, phone calls: How Trump is boosting GOP unity in impeachment inquiry",
        "text": "President Donald Trump sat surrounded by a group of his most loyal defenders on Capitol Hill. \n\nIn every direction from his box seat at the World Series last month, as the Washington Nationals faced off against the Houston Astros, there sat a Republican who has been outspoken in defense of the president over the impeachment inquiry launched by House Democrats.\n\n\"Seats aren't bad,\" Florida Republican Rep. Matt Gaetz, a staunch Trump ally and one of about a dozen lawmakers invited to the game, wrote on Twitter alongside a selfie taken with Trump and first lady Melania Trump smiling in the stands. \n\nAs the impeachment inquiry has unfolded over the past few months, Trump has been nurturing his friendships with allies like Gaetz in an effort to keep his party united. \n\nSince the controversy with Ukraine surfaced in September, Trump has spoken directly or in groups with at least 120 House Republicans and by the end of the week, will have talked with 40 GOP senators to outline his defense against the impeachment accusations lodged by Democratic critics, two senior administration officials told USA TODAY. \n\nThe effort, experts say, is something that could help both unify and invigorate congressional Republicans during this crucial chapter where he is counting on them to fight Democratic accusations that he abused his power by pressuring Ukraine to investigate his political rival, Joe Biden. Trump denies those accusations and denounced the impeachment inquiry, which is moving into a new phase with the first public hearings scheduled to begin Wednesday.\n\nKeeping Republicans united\nFor weeks, as witness after witness appeared behind closed doors \u2014 telling lawmakers investigating impeachment their insider accounts of how the Trump administration circumvented typical diplomatic procedures with Ukraine in a shadow campaign to lock down investigations that would help Trump politically \u2014 Republicans have tested out a variety of defenses.\n\nThere was no quid pro quo, some say. There was a quid-pro-quo but that is a normal part of foreign policy, White House Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney argued before quickly backtracking. Some attempted to dismiss key testimony as hearsay due to the witnesses not having direct conversations with the president.\n\nSen. Lindsey Graham, a South Carolina Republican who is perhaps Trump's staunchest ally in the Senate, said he found the foreign policy toward Ukraine \"incoherent\" and argued those in the administration \"seem to be incapable of forming a quid pro quo.\"\n\nWitnesses: Who are the 15 people who have testified in the impeachment inquiry?\n\nImpeachment Week 8:House opens public hearings featuring State Department officials critical of Trump\n\nThe president, meanwhile, has rallied the troops, making personal phone calls, inviting key Republicans to events and even hosting a pair of movie nights at the executive mansion, two administration officials told USA TODAY. \n\nAlong with joining Trump at the World Series, Republican lawmakers have traveled aboard Marine One, the presidential helicopter, and sat with him at the Ultimate Fighting Championship in the heart of New York City at Madison Square Garden and to the Alabama-LSU football game, one of the biggest rivalries in college football. \n\nKey lawmakers, including Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, have also made appearances at Trump's rallies and at the White House for lunches in recent weeks. \n\nTrump has spoken in person with 80 House Republicans, administration officials told USA TODAY. At least 40 other House Republicans have attended retreats at Camp David hosted by White House acting Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney and other officials; Trump has phoned into at least four of those Camp David meetings.\n\nThe officials said Trump hopes to have contact with every Republican lawmaker by the time impeachment comes to an end. \n\n\"A lot of this happens on the phone, out of sight,\" the officials said. \n\nWhile impeachment is a primary topic of these talks, Trump also speaks with lawmakers about issues like the proposed Canada-Mexico trade deal and new legislation on prescription drugs.\n\nIndeed, that is one of the things Trump urges Republicans to say in public: That Democrats are obsessed with impeachment and ignoring the needs of the nation.\n\n5 things to watch:What to look for as House opens first public hearings in Trump impeachment inquiry\n\nTrump also makes small talk with members, with topics ranging from Conan the hero dog who helped take down the leader of ISIS to the World Series run of baseball's Washington Nationals. The president even signed a Trump board game for one member, whom officials would not identify. \n\n\"The most valuable resource that the president has is his time,\" said Doug Heye, a Republican strategist. \"and if he could make that time available for members of Congress, that is something that they react to.\" \n\n\"That is a great tool of leverage that any president has, and when you're in times of crisis, you need to use it,\" Heye said.\n\nBut the key will be not only keeping key allies as outspoken defenders. It will be to prevent a batch of House Republicans who are retiring from defecting and keeping the GOP united on the other side of the Capitol, where a two-thirds majority in the Senate would be required to actually remove Trump from office should the House vote to impeach him. \n\nMore:5 key lawmakers to watch as Congress sets ground rules for Trump impeachment inquiry\n\nIt's not unlike what President Bill Clinton sought to do in 1998 when he fended off being removed from office after being impeached for perjury and obstruction of justice related to his affair with White House intern Monica Lewinsky.\n\nCurrently, only a few Republicans have publicly voiced concerns about Trump's conduct. When Clinton was battling impeachment \"we probably had 50-75 people who we were worried about,\" Steve Elmendorf, chief of staff to Democratic House Minority Leader Dick Gephardt as impeachment moved through the House in 1998, said of Democrats then. \n\nLike Trump, Clinton also worked the phones with lawmakers.\n\n\"Clinton was famous for a lot of individual one-on-ones,\" Elmendorf said, where Clinton would sometimes \"call up people at midnight and talk to them for an hour.\"\n\nElmendorf said the Clinton White House moved early on to ensure support from key constituencies in the House, including the Congressional Black Caucus, who had emerged as some of Clinton's most vocal and steadfast defenders.\n\nThe efforts were largely successful, though not entirely. When the House of Representatives voted on Clinton's impeachment in December 1998, only five Democrats broke with the party and voted to pass three of the four articles of impeachment. \n\nA divided GOP strategy on impeachment\nDemocrats have so far presented a mostly unified front on the impeachment inquiry. As the public hearings begin, they plan to argue that Trump abused the power of his office to pressure the Ukrainian government to open investigations into his political adversaries and used both $400 million in military aid and a key White House meeting as leverage. \n\nRepublicans, on the other hand, have struggled to find a consistent strategy in defending Trump amid the barrage of new details released each day in the Ukraine saga. But the efforts over the weeks has offered a preview and hints of what is to come in public hearings. \n\n\"We're going to be seeing to a great extent, two very different conversations with two very different audiences,\" Heye, the Republican strategist said. \n\nAlex Conant, another Republican strategist and former aide to Sen. Marco Rubio, said both sides of the aisle will be trying to reach different people.\n\nDemocrats will be making a serious case in hopes of persuading those who haven't made up their minds over whether Trump should be removed from office, and Republicans will be rallying the base and trying to keep a united front. The aim is to make hearings as partisan as possible, a strategy that hopes to discredit the Democratic case. \n\n\"The strategy is all about circling the wagons, just keeping Republicans on board and convincing the base that this is a partisan witch hunt,\" Conant said. \"It's not a message for suburban Independents. It's a message for hardcore Republicans.\" \n\nRep. Andy Biggs, chairman of the ultra-conservative House Freedom Caucus and Republican member of the House Judiciary Committee \u2014 the panel that will ultimately be tasked with deciding whether to file articles of impeachment against the president \u2014 was part of the group of Republicans sitting with Trump at the World Series.\n\n\"I think his demeanor is justifiably upset,\" Biggs said of the president. \"He's upset and angry at the way this has unfolded.\" \n\nBiggs and other House Republicans argue that the impeachment process so far is unfair to the president, the substance is favorable to the president, and that the origins of the inquiry are partisan.\n\n\"I think the Democrats are playing with fire here,\" Biggs said. \n\nAn 18-page strategy memo sent to House Republicans on Tuesday argued that the body of evidence does not show the president acted maliciously to withhold funds from Ukraine for his own benefit, rather that Trump has a \"deep-seated, genuine, and reasonable skepticism toward Ukraine, and a vocal position that Europe should contribute more to regional defense.\" \n\nThe memo outlines keys points of the case Democrats are expected to make and suggestions for how Republicans can counter them.\n\nIn a move to bolster Trump\u2019s defense ahead of Wednesday's hearing, Republicans moved Rep. Jim Jordan of Ohio, a close ally of the president, to the House Intelligence Committee.\n\nWhile Jordan is known for his feisty defense of the president and sly smiles as he attempts to pick apart Democratic narratives, his star power might not be enough. He and other members of the committee will only be allowed five minutes to make their case. \n\nJordan and fellow Republicans on the committee held a mock hearing Tuesday, preparing how they will dismantle the case that Democrats are meticulously putting together. \n\nTheir preparations and loyalty to the president are about to face the ultimate test.

        "text": "Projecting unusual calm in the middle of a political firestorm, President Trump pleaded ignorance Wednesday about the first public impeachment hearing, unexpectedly insisting that he really wasn't paying attention to sworn testimony in the House Intelligence Committee that could determine whether he serves out his term in office.\nThe disclaimer might be more credible if Trump hadn't already tweeted or retweeted about the hearing 34 times earlier in the day \u2014 including mocking the Democrats' use of what he called \"television lawyers\" to help question witnesses.\n\nKnown for his addiction to cable television, the former reality TV star-turned-president insisted he didn't watch the historic hearing \"for one minute,\" suggesting he was more focused on weightier matters of statecraft.\n\n\"I hear it's a joke,\" Trump said at a joint news conference in the White House East Room with the visiting president of Turkey, Recep Tayyip Erdogan. \"I've been with the president, which is much more important.\"\n\nAsked about the first day's ostensible bombshell \u2014 the disclosure by William B. Taylor Jr., the acting ambassador to Ukraine, that one of his aides had personally heard Trump discuss his demand for investigations of Democrats on a cellphone call to an official in Kyiv \u2014 Trump professed bewilderment.\n\n\"I know nothing about that,\" Trump said. \"First time I've heard of it.\"\n\nTrump's casual, almost breezy dismissal suggested he and his aides were adjusting to the new public phase of the impeachment inquiry by, at least for now, casting the proceedings as boring.\n\nToo boring, he seemed eager to convey, to merit any of his time.\n\nHis mild comments came as a surprise if only because Trump is not known for message discipline, and normally spews his anger or disdain with relentless 140-character certainty. Indeed, several hours earlier he had accused his accusers \u2014 Taylor and George Kent, an assistant secretary of State, the first two witnesses \u2014 of being \"NEVER TRUMPERS.\"\n\nAsked about Trump's tweet in the hearing, both diplomats denied that characterization, describing themselves as nonpartisan career professionals who had served for decades under both Republican and Democratic presidents.\n\nEmbracing Turkey's autocratic leader at the White House while lawmakers at the other end of Pennsylvania Avenue focused on Trump's apparent efforts to force Ukraine to investigate his political foes by freezing U.S. military aid \u2014 a move that could benefit another autocrat, Russian President Vladimir Putin \u2014 provided a strong symbolic subtext to the day's events.\n\nBut Trump's stoic efforts to appear preoccupied with foreign affairs, however controversial Erdogan might be, and unaffected by the impeachment hearings that garnered wall-to-wall TV and radio coverage, served a strategic purpose, according to a Republican official familiar with the White House game plan.\n\n\"If you watch the hearings and you believe these witnesses are ultimately credible, that could be a problem\" for Trump, the official said, speaking on condition of anonymity. \"If you're convinced it's boring, maybe you don't watch as much, which is what we'd prefer.\"\n\nRepublicans, ironically, had clamored for public hearings ever since House Democrats began closed-door hearings on Oct. 1 to take sworn depositions. Many of those witnesses are now scheduled to testify in public.\n\nBut when GOP lawmakers finally got their chance to question witnesses in public, Rep. Devin Nunes, (R-Tulare), the committee's top Republican, derided the hearing as a made-for-television \"drama,\" dismissing the probe as \"the low-rent Ukrainian sequel\" after \"the main performance, the Russia hoax, has ended.\"\n\nNumerous GOP lawmakers pointed out that the two diplomats didn't have firsthand knowledge of Trump's now-infamous July 25 phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, looking to dismiss their testimony as hearsay.\n\nAt his news conference, Trump made the same point \u2014 even as he insisted he had not watched the testimony.\n\n\"They said it's all third-hand information, nothing direct at all,\" Trump said.\n\nStill, the diplomats' testimony offered a detailed and damning picture of a president putting his personal political interests at the center of U.S. relations with Ukraine, a struggling European democracy that is under siege by Russian-backed troops.\n\nTrump mostly sought to avoid the subject of the hearings during his afternoon news conference, which began an hour late and only after the six-hour hearing on Capitol Hill had wrapped up.\n\nBut he was asked about it. Standing stiffly and speaking in a measured tone, Trump expressed his desire to reveal the identity of the whistleblower whose Sept. 12 complaint sparked the inquiry, and to investigate the intelligence community's inspector general, who validated the complaint as credible and urgent.\n\n\"This is a sham. It shouldn't be allowed,\" Trump said. \"It was a situation that was caused by people that shouldn't have allowed it to happen. I want to find out who is the whistleblower.\"\n\nHe added, \"I want to find out ... why would [the inspector general] have presented that?\"\n\nErdogan made a point of criticizing the Democrat-led House \u2014 a brazen move for a foreign leader at a podium in the White House \u2014 for approving a resolution condemning the century-old mass killings of Armenians by Ottoman Turks as a genocide.\n\nHe said he hoped the GOP-run Senate \"will take the United States out of this vicious cycle.\"\n\nTrump praised Erdogan, calling him a \"great friend.\"\n\nTrump had told reporters around noon that he was \"too busy\" to watch the hearing, but he then took a shot at Daniel Goldman, a former federal prosecutor from New York who questioned the witnesses on behalf of Democrats.\n\n\"I see they're using lawyers that are television lawyers \u2014 they took some guys off television,\" he said. \"You know, I'm not surprised to see it, because [Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam B. Schiff (D-Burbank)] can't do his own questions.\"\n\nAfter weeks of White House denials that it needed a \"war room\" to coordinate a response, Trump reelection campaign officials, Republican lawmakers and other backers appeared to operate off similar talking points, tweeting comments that sought to poke holes in the Democrats' case.\n\nWhite House Press Secretary Stephanie Grisham dismissed the proceeding as \"boring\" and \"a colossal waste of taxpayer time & money.\"\n\nTrump's reelection campaign blasted out a fundraising email as the House proceeding began, seeking to raise $3 million over 24 hours and dismissing the impeachment inquiry as an unwarranted partisan attempt to take down the president. The letter, signed by Trump, was blunt.\n\n\"It's obvious they hate me,\" he wrote to supporters. \"But more importantly, they HATE YOU.\""

        "text": "A new billboard in Washington, D.C., from a group founded by 2020 Democratic presidential candidate Tom Steyer warns Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell to support the impeachment of President Donald Trump or \"lose your job.\"\n\n\"Moscow Mitch: Do Your Duty or Lose Your Job,\" reads the billboard from Need to Impeach. The billboard, which includes McConnell's face, first appeared Wednesday.\n\nThe ad's debut comes on the same day as the first public hearings in the House impeachment inquiry that is probing Trump's dealings with Ukraine.\n\nCritics have used the \"Moscow Mitch\" nickname to pester McConnell for blocking legislation aimed at strengthening the security of U.S. elections in the aftermath of Russian interference in the 2016 presidential race.\n\nNeed to Impeach's lead strategist, Kevin Mack, told The Courier Journal the group has targeted McConnell before but that \"the ground has shifted\" after Kentucky Gov. Matt Bevin lost a tight reelection battle last week to Democrat Andy Beshear.\n\nMack said McConnell could lose three things over the next year: his \"legacy as majority leader,\" his reelection campaign and his role as majority leader.\n\nImpeachment hearing: Diplomat says Trump felt 'wronged' by Ukraine \n\nMcConnell must also deal with Trump and the impeachment inquiry, Mack said.\n\n\"He has a very difficult decision to make and that's whether to risk all of those things to cover up President Trump's high crimes and misdemeanors,\" Mack said. \"... Our feeling is that Mitch McConnell is one of the most self-serving politicians in history, and he's going to figure out what's in his best interest.\"\n\nThe mobile billboard will be shown through Friday on a truck that is driving on streets around the White House, U.S. Capitol, Senate and House of Representatives office buildings as well as on Constitution Avenue.\n\nSteyer, a billionaire activist, philanthropist and former hedge fund manager, founded Need to Impeach in 2017 and stepped aside from his group this summer after announcing his 2020 candidacy.\n\nMack said Steyer is still a big financier for his group.\n\nNeed to Impeach will also start running television ads in the next few weeks in Kentucky and in the D.C. area that will target McConnell, Mack said.\n\nThe Kentucky ads will run in areas of the state where \"support for Republicans has softened,\" Mack added.\n\nAnalysis:Matt Bevin's down. Does that mean 'Moscow Mitch' is next? Probably not\n\nNeed to Impeach's belief that McConnell is weaker following Bevin's defeat is a sentiment shared by some but definitely not all political pundits.\n\nSeveral Kentucky political experts noted in interviews last week with The Courier Journal that McConnell has repeatedly defeated challengers since his election 35 years ago, adding that Bevin's defeat is not necessarily a sign of things to come for McConnell.\n\nTrump doesn't think the Senate majority leader is imperiled either, tweeting the morning after the Nov. 5 statewide election that \"Based on the Kentucky election results ... McConnell will win BIG in Kentucky next year!\"\n\nTrump was referring to how, apart from Bevin's defeat, Kentucky Republicans swept the statewide races for positions such as attorney general, secretary of state and treasurer.\n\nStill, Mack said that while McConnell and other Republicans chalked up Bevin's defeat to the governor's low approval ratings, McConnell's approval numbers are \"even worse.\"\n\nBevin, who challenged McConnell in the 2014 Senate Republican primary, has refused to concede after falling to Beshear by about 5,000 votes in the Nov. 5 statewide election.\n\nThe Republican incumbent has instead requested a recanvass, or a recheck of the vote totals in each county, which will occur Thursday.\n\nWhile visiting a stainless steel producer Monday in Carroll County, McConnell told reporters he thinks \"barring some dramatic reversal on a recanvass, that we'll have a different governor in three weeks.\"\n\nWhat to know:The vote recanvass for Kentucky's governor election is Thursday\n\nWhen asked about what Bevin's loss may mean for his own reelection prospects, McConnell replied that \"we'll find out because the 2020 election's underway already.\"\n\nHe added that Kentucky Democrats still have to pick a nominee, but he will \"be happy to run against whoever wins the nomination.\"\n\nFormer Marine and 2018 House candidate Amy McGrath is one of the Democrats seeking to unseat McConnell and has built a sizable fundraising coffer.\n\nOther Democrats who have announced bids in the 2020 Senate race are retired Marine Mike Broihier and health care professional Steve Cox. \n\nDemocratic state Rep. Charles Booker of Louisville, Kentucky House Minority Leader Rocky Adkins and Kentucky Sports Radio host Matt Jones are also considering bids.\n\nBooker announced this week that he is forming an exploratory committee.\n\nMack, with Need to Impeach, said the new ad in Washington targeting McConnell cost less than $20,000 and was paid for through fundraising.\n\nNeed to Impeach organizes grassroots impeachment efforts and claims that over 8.4 million Americans have signed a petition supporting Trump's impeachment.\n\nThe mobile billboard is hardly the only attempt to call out McConnell and other Senate Republicans on the impeachment inquiry.\n\nSee also:Booker on possibly challenging McConnell: 'Goliath underestimated David'\n\nAs part of a $3.1 million ad buy, Need to Impeach launched a spot in October that primarily ran on Fox News and claimed \"Mitch is afraid to cross Donald Trump.\"\n\n\"Just look at what happened to Mitt Romney,\" the ad said. \"So will Mitch defend the Constitution against all enemies foreign and domestic? Or protect Trump at all costs?\"\n\nNeed to Impeach is also running TV spots in Iowa, Maine, Colorado and Arizona that urge four GOP senators from those states to remove Trump from office.\n\nMembers of progressive advocacy groups MoveOn and Bluegrass Activist Alliance were expected to hold late afternoon protests Wednesday outside federal courthouses in Lexington and Covington to demand McConnell support Trump's impeachment.\n\nMcConnell did not seem too interested when asked earlier this week about diplomats William Taylor and George Kent appearing Wednesday before the House in the public impeachment hearings.\n\nMcConnell told Politico he is instead going to \"be paying attention to what we're doing in the Senate.\"\n\nBut on the Senate floor Wednesday, McConnell reiterated that he feels House Democrats are neglecting Trump's due process rights with the impeachment inquiry.\n\n\"So it's hardly surprising that this partisan journey is not yielding a neutral process,\" McConnell said. \"Unfortunately, it's also crowding out important legislation for the American people.\"\n\nHe also told reporters earlier in November that if Trump were to face a Senate impeachment trial today, \"I don't think there's any question it would not lead to a removal.\"\n\nAnd in a campaign ad that started running on Facebook in September, McConnell said \"impeachment stops\" with \"me as majority leader.\"\n\nEarlier:Mitch McConnell is hearing impeachment criticism from an unlikely source \n\nReach Billy Kobin at bkobin@courierjournal.com or 502-582-7030.

Then fast forward to Ukraine, where the new Ukrainian President spoke unfavorably about her in my second phone call with him. It is a U.S. President's absolute right to appoint ambassadors,\" the president wrote.\n\nTrump TWEETs\n\nThe time stamp on the tweet is 10 a.m., 30 minutes after Yovanovitch started her opening statement at the House Intelligence Committee's impeachment hearing.\n\nYovanovitch, whose career of service to the U.S. spanned more than three decades, was asked at the hearing about the tweets.\n\n\"I actually think that where I served over the years I and others have demonstrably made things better for the U.S. as well as for the countries that I served in,\" she said.\n\n\"It's very intimidating,\" she added when asked again about the president's tweets.\n\n\"I want to let you know, ambassador, that some of us here take witness intimidation very, very seriously,\" said House Intelligence Chairman Adam Schiff, D-Calif.\n\nYovanovitch had served the U.S. in Ukraine from August 2016 until May 2019, when Trump ousted her. She testified that she \"had no agenda other than to pursue our stated foreign policy goals\" during her tenure and said she was the victim of a \"smear campaign\" pushed in part by Trump's personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani.\n\nTrump, in his July 25 phone call with Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskiy, called Yovanovitch \"bad news\" and offered the cryptic remark that \"she's going to go through some things.\"\n\nThat call is now at the center of the impeachment inquiry into whether Trump abused his office by asking Zelenskiy to announce investigations involving former Vice President Joe Biden and his son Hunter.\n\nYovanovitch, who was already removed as ambassador by the time of Trump's July 25 call, said that Trump's remark about her \"didn't sound good. It sounded like a threat.\"\n\n\"It's not a very precise phrase,\" she added. \"It kind of felt like a vague threat.\"\n\nFormer Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton, who lost to Trump in 2016, tweeted, \"Witness intimidation is a crime, no matter who does it.\""

He added that Sondland responded to the president that the Ukrainians were ready to move forward.\n\nOnce off the phone, Holmes asked Sondland what Trump thought of Ukraine. Sondland told him that Trump \"cares more about the investigations of Biden\" than he does about Ukraine, according to Taylor.\n\nIt was unclear if Holmes would show up, but he was expected to appear after being subpoenaed by the House, similar to other career State Department employees.\n\nHis testimony could be impactful, adding significant evidence of Trump's direct involvement in the effort to pressure Ukraine to open investigations that would favor him politically, including into former Vice President Joe Biden, his son Hunter, and Hunter's position on the board of a Ukrainian energy company.\n\nSen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., a stalwart Trump ally who has dismissed the impeachment inquiry, said on Thursday that Holmes's evidence would be firsthand evidence.\n\n\"He said he heard the president,\" he said. \"It would be an exception to the hearsay rule.\"\n\nTrump reportedly mocked the new development during a White House meeting with conservative Republican senators on Thursday, according to Sen. Kevin Cramer of North Dakota.\n\n\"It's so far-fetched ... I don't know if it happened or not, but three months later, the guy's staffer says, 'Oh, by the way -- I think I did hear a phone call, I think it was the president on the other end,\" Cramer recounted to reporters on Thursday.\n\nBut those who have worked with Holmes have defended him as a man of honor and integrity.\n\n\"David Holmes is a remarkably talented career diplomat, one of the very best of his generation,\" Bill Burns, a veteran diplomat who served as ambassador to Russia under President George W.

        "text": "Donald Trump Jr. cut short his event at UCLA Sunday promoting his book, \"Triggered,\" when a group of far-right activists continually chanted \"Q-and-A\" and \"America First,\" driving him from the stage.\n\nOne day earlier, Rep. Dan Crenshaw, R-Texas, was asked a series of questions about Israel at a question-and-answer session at an Arizona State University event. After one attendee made an anti-Semitic reference to the 9/11 attacks, Crenshaw asked, \"What do you guys call yourselves? There's a name for your group, right?\"\n\nCrenshaw was met with a series of sarcastic answers before the group started chanting: \"America First! America First!\"\n\nThe group does have a name, and its adherents are part of a larger far-right, anti-Semitic and homophobic movement that is trying to emerge into the larger world.\n\nThe trolls pushing the movement online call themselves Groypers, a reference to the name of a meme \u2014 a running joke in the form of a customizable image \u2014 on extreme, far-right parts of anonymous internet forums 4chan and Reddit. There is little indication that the word has any other meaning outside of its relation to the meme, which is a drawing of a frog with its hands clasped that is similar to a drawing that gained popularity with internet trolls in recent years.\n\nThe group is led by a minor celebrity in the alt-right named Nick Fuentes, who runs a YouTube channel called \"America First.\"\n\nFuentes' and his group have gained national attention for a series of identical stunts, in which they take over question-and-answer portions of events with conservatives who align with President Donald Trump. They then confront the speakers with anti-gay, anti-Semitic and racist questions, efforts that resemble internet trolling taken into the real world, which are then streamed online for its supporters.\n\nThe troll takeovers have been met with mixed or negative reactions. A person who last month posed a homophobic question during a Q-and-A with Charlie Kirk, a popular figure among young conservatives and head of the super PAC Turning Point USA, was laughed off by the hosts and audience members.\n\nBut the troll's target audience wasn't in the room. Fuentes was watching the event and livestreaming it on YouTube, where he built up anticipation as one of \"my guys\" waited in the Q-and-A line.\n\n\"Here we go. Here we go,\" Feunters said on the stream. \"Groyper time.\"\n\nOther white nationalist voices have recently been banned from platforms like Facebook, Twitter and YouTube in recent months as part of a broader crackdown on hate speech. Fuentes, meanwhile, has been able to add more subscribers to his YouTube channel.\n\nFuentes receives donations on his livestreams using YouTube's \"Superchat\" function, which allows for instant donations to streamers. His account is still verified on Twitter, giving him an algorithmic bump in searches and trending topics.\n\nFuentes first gained national attention when he decided to leave Boston University after attending the Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, where anti-racist protester Heather Heyer was killed and 33 others were injured. Fuentes complained in a Facebook post after the event that he was unfairly singled out by liberal activists for talking about white pride.\n\nJoan Donovan and Brian Friedberg, who research disinformation and extremism for the Technology and Social Change Project at Harvard University's Shorenstein Center, have been studying Fuentes' rise for the last three years. They said his group has taken off in the last six weeks.\n\nDonovan compared Fuentes to white nationalist Richard Spencer, though Fuentes had previously received far less attention.\n\n\"He's no less dangerous than Spencer. His time just hadn't come yet,\" Donovan said. \"He's a Holocaust denier, a vicious homophobe, and anti-immigration talking points that's so bad most journalists are going to read it as trolling. But it's not trolling. He's just trying to seed these talking points, and infect the culture with these discussions.\"\n\nDonovan said that Fuentes has capitalized on the factionalization of pro-Trump conservativism that has emerged since the Charlottesville rally. As the president and some of his media surrogates have tried to push a comparatively more moderate message, some online trolls have begun to feel left behind.\n\n\"As these middle-of-the-road conservatives defend Trump, Fuentes looks more and more appealing,\" Donovan said. \"He can say he supports \u2018America First,' and these platforms give him a space for that political identity to flourish.\"\n\nFriedberg said the goal of the Groyper army at events like the ones that targeted Trump Jr.'s book signing this weekend is simple.\n\n\"What they're trying to do in these explosive Q-and-A's is say, \u2018Shocking language around race is back on the table.'\"\n\nThe driving ideology of the group, he said, is even simpler: \"We just want to be racist with our friends on Twitter. It's low commitment for high amounts of racism.\""

        "text": "President Trump has discussed dismissing the intelligence community's inspector general, Michael Atkinson, because Mr. Atkinson reported a whistle-blower's complaint about Mr. Trump's interactions with Ukraine to Congress after concluding it was credible, according to four people familiar with the discussions.\n\nMr. Trump first expressed his dismay about Mr. Atkinson around the time the whistle-blower's complaint became public in September. In recent weeks, he has continued to raise with aides the possibility of firing him, one of the people said.\n\nThe president has said he does not understand why Mr. Atkinson shared the complaint, which outlined how Mr. Trump asked the Ukrainian president to investigate Mr. Trump's political rivals at the same time he was withholding military aid from the country. He has said he believes Mr. Atkinson, whom he appointed in 2017, has been disloyal, one of the people said.\n\nMr. Trump's private complaints about Mr. Atkinson have come as he has publicly questioned his integrity and accused him of working with the Democrats to sabotage his presidency.\n\nIt is unclear how far Mr. Trump's discussions about removing Mr. Atkinson have progressed. Two people familiar with what took place said they thought that Mr. Trump was just venting, and insisted that Mr. Atkinson's dismissal was never under serious consideration.\n\nBut the mixture of public attacks and private discussions about a possible dismissal is a familiar way Mr. Trump has undermined investigators who have examined his conduct or that of people close to him. The president publicly criticized James B. Comey, the former F.B.I. director, and Jeff Sessions, the former attorney general, before he dismissed them for perceived disloyalty.\n\nMr. Trump believes he has the power to fire anyone in the executive branch, though aides say they have learned to ignore many of his private rants, unless the president brings up the subject repeatedly and appears on the precipice of making a move they feel could be damaging.\n\nSpokesmen for the White House and inspector general's office declined to comment.\n\nInspectors general are supposed to be insulated from politics so they can follow the facts and provide oversight of the executive branch. While presidents have the authority to remove them, they are supposed to take that action only in cases of misconduct or failure to fulfill duties.\n\nIn 2009, President Barack Obama fired the inspector general of the Corporation for National and Community Service, which runs AmeriCorps, for what White House officials said was incompetence. Republicans and even some Democrats questioned the move, while conservative pundits held up the inspector general as a victim of Mr. Obama's politics.\n\nEditors' Picks\n\nCan You Cure Constipation Without Laxatives?\n\nThe High-Risk Feat of Bringing \u2018American Born Chinese' to TV\n\nHow Scorsese, DiCaprio and De Niro Made \u2018Killers of the Flower Moon'\nPeople close to the president believe the political consequences of firing Mr. Atkinson could be devastating, especially when Mr. Trump needs all the Republican support he can get for a potential impeachment trial in the Senate.\n\nMr. Trump's decision in May 2017 to fire Mr. Comey, who was leading an investigation into ties between Mr. Trump's campaign and Russia, set off a firestorm that led to the appointment of the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III.\n\nThe following month, after it became public that Mr. Mueller was investigating Mr. Trump for obstructing justice, Mr. Trump told the White House counsel at the time, Donald F. McGahn II, to have Mr. Mueller removed. That incident later became a central episode in Mr. Mueller's report, and House Democrats are still considering using that incident in an article of impeachment on obstruction of justice.\n\nMr. Atkinson's handling of the anonymous whistle-blower's complaint was a major factor in the decision by House Democrats to initiate an impeachment inquiry. After conducting an investigation that led him to believe the complaint was credible, he forwarded it to the government's top intelligence official, Joseph Maguire, who did not provide it to Congress in the time frame required under the law, but did allow Mr. Atkinson to alert lawmakers about the existence of the complaint.\n\nIn early September, Mr. Atkinson told Congress that Mr. Maguire had refused to hand over the document. Under pressure from Democratic lawmakers, Mr. Maguire then gave the document to Congress.\n\nMr. Maguire later acknowledged that he and his top lawyer had checked with the White House and Justice Department about whether he was permitted to turn the document over to Congress, saying that he was concerned that such an action could infringe on executive privilege issues.\n\nLawyers for Mr. Maguire and the Justice Department said that because Mr. Trump was not a member of the intelligence community, Mr. Atkinson did not have the jurisdiction to deliver the report.\n\nMr. Trump said in recent days that he believes Mr. Atkinson should be forced to testify at impeachment hearings the Democrats are scheduled to begin this week.\n\n\"I recommend that Nervous Nancy Pelosi (who backed up Schiff's lie), Shifty Adam Schiff, Sleepy Joe Biden, the Whistleblower (who miraculously disappeared after I released the transcript of the call), the 2nd Whistleblower (who also disappeared), & the I.G., be part of the list!\" Mr. Trump tweeted on Saturday, using the acronym for inspector general.\n\nMr. Trump's public attacks on Mr. Atkinson have been part of his larger attempts to delegitimize the whistle-blower and the process that led to the disclosure of the complaint.\n\nIn these efforts, Mr. Trump has tried to present himself as an advocate for whistle-blowers, falsely claiming that he had been behind legislation to protect them.\n\n\"To think I signed the Whistleblower Protection Act!\" Mr. Trump tweeted on Monday, misstating what he had signed."

        "text": "Heading into Friday's impeachment hearing, the Republican strategy for dealing with Marie L. Yovanovitch was simple: treat the ousted ambassador to Ukraine with respect during her testimony on Friday and avoid any appearance of bullying a veteran diplomat who had been vilified and driven from her post.\n\nPresident Trump blew up the plan.\n\nMs. Yovanovitch had just begun to recount, in powerful and personal terms, the devastation and fear she felt when she learned Mr. Trump had attacked her during a July 25 phone call with the president of Ukraine. She was \"shocked, appalled, devastated that the president of the United States would talk about any ambassador like that,\" she said.\n\nIt was just the kind of human moment that Republican members of the House Intelligence Committee had anticipated \u2014 a political trap they were determined not to fall into. But they apparently didn't anticipate how Mr. Trump would react.\n\n\"Everywhere Marie Yovanovitch went turned bad,\" Mr. Trump wrote on Twitter, sneering at her to his 66 million followers while recounting an earlier posting in her diplomatic career. \"She started off in Somalia, how did that go?\"\n\nBy repeating the same kind of verbal attack that made Ms. Yovanovitch a sympathetic witness for the Democrats in the first place, Mr. Trump undercut his own party's best chance at minimizing the impact of her testimony. And he handed Democrats another new argument \u2014 that his tweet amounted to nothing less than witness intimidation that itself could become an article of impeachment.\n\n\"That was not part of the plan, obviously,\" said Jeff Flake, the former Republican senator from Arizona, who clashed repeatedly with Mr. Trump before he retired in 2017. \"He can't help himself. You would think every instinct would be to lay off. She's a sympathetic witness. But he seems just to be incapable of controlling himself.\"\n\nThe president's tweet was at once surprising and entirely predictable.\n\nMr. Trump has used Twitter to attack his adversaries nearly 6,000 times since becoming president. He has repeatedly tweeted that the impeachment inquiry is a \"hoax\" and has lashed out at diplomats and national security officials calling them \"never Trumpers\" who are out to undermine his agenda. For weeks, he and his allies have obsessed about the identity of the whistle-blower whose complaint about Mr. Trump's phone call with President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine jump-started the impeachment inquiry.\n\nBut his decision to fling the sharp-edged insult an hour into Ms. Yovanovitch's testimony was the latest evidence \u2014 as if any more was needed \u2014 that Mr. Trump's instincts are rarely in sync with the interests of his party.\n\nImage\nPresident Trump speaking at the White House on Friday. Mr. Trump tweeted about Ms. Yovanovitch during the hearing. \nPresident Trump speaking at the White House on Friday. Mr. Trump tweeted about Ms. Yovanovitch during the hearing. Credit...T.J. Kirkpatrick for The New York Times\n\nWhite House aides insisted on Friday that the president was too busy to watch the hearing, but in fact, he chose to watch Ms. Yovanovitch, who had stuck in his craw because he saw her as an obstacle to his desire to have investigations into Hunter Biden, the younger son of former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., people close to Mr. Trump said.\n\nOn the first day of the impeachment hearings on Wednesday, the president had managed to avoid commenting about the two men who testified \u2014 William B. Taylor Jr., the top diplomat in Ukraine, and George P. Kent, a senior State Department official.\n\nBut his inability to hold his fire on Friday raised fresh doubts among his allies and White House advisers about what he will do next week, when eight witnesses are scheduled to testify in public hearings over the course of three days.\n\nMr. Trump did not clear his Friday tweet with top White House aides before putting it out, leaving some of his advisers deeply dispirited. Privately, they acknowledged he had done himself damage.\n\nNot long after Mr. Trump's tweet, his son Donald Trump Jr. fired off his own broadside, tweeting, \"America hired ??@realDonaldTrump?? to fire people like the first three witnesses we've seen. Career government bureaucrats and nothing more.\"\n\nMr. Trump's congressional allies had largely held back from those kinds of direct attacks on Mr. Taylor and Mr. Kent. They had planned to be especially careful with Ms. Yovanovitch.\n\nOn Thursday, they met for several hours in Room HVC-215 of the Capitol for a practice session aimed at coordinating their overall message, with members who were not on the Intelligence Committee playing the parts of the former ambassador and Representative Adam B. Schiff, the Democratic chairman of the Intelligence committee.\n\nOne thing they were clear about: They intended to use the same care grilling Ms. Yovanovitch that Republican senators tried to employ during last year's testimony by Christine Blasey Ford, who accused Justice Brett Kavanaugh of assaulting her when the two were in high school, according to one person close to the House Republican leadership.\n\nMr. Trump didn't get the message \u2014 and Democrats seized on the political opportunity he handed them. Not long after the president tweeted his thoughts on Ms. Yovanovitch, Mr. Schiff read it aloud, to Ms. Yovanovitch and the cameras.\n\n\"Now the president, in real time, is attacking you,\" Mr. Schiff told her. \"What effect do you think that has on other witnesses willingness to come forward and expose wrongdoing?\"\n\nHer answer was succinct: \"It's very intimidating.\"\n\nRepresentative Eric Swalwell, Democrat of California, used his five minutes of questioning at the hearing to decry what he called the president's \"disgusting\" tweet.\n\n\"He smeared you when you were in Ukraine,\" Mr. Swalwell told Ms. Yovanovitch. \"He smeared you on that phone call with President Zelensky on July 25. He is smearing you right now as you are testifying. Ambassador Yovanovitch, are the president's smears going to stop you from fighting corruption?\"\n\n\"Well,\" she answered, clearly not wanting to take the bait of a direct confrontation with the president, \"I will continue my work.\"\n\nImage\nCommittee members, aides and lawyers during a break in the hearing. \nCommittee members, aides and lawyers during a break in the hearing. Credit...Erin Schaff/The New York Times\n\nFollowing the hearing, some Republican lawmakers defended the president's decision to tweet at Ms. Yovanovitch even as others grudgingly acknowledged that it wasn't the kind of message they had hoped to highlight.\n\n\"We're not here to talk about tweets,\" Representative Elise Stefanik, Republican of New York, told reporters. \"This is not the first or last tweet they are going to complain about.\"\n\nBut under repeated questioning, she added: \"I said I disagree with the tone of the tweet.\"\n\nMs. Stefanik and other Republican members struggled to focus on the message they had hoped to deliver throughout the day: that Democrats had put in place an unfair impeachment process that denied Mr. Trump's defenders their rights. Representative Lee Zeldin, Republican of New York, said Mr. Trump was just \"fighting back.\"\n\nBut that was not how the week was supposed to go, especially at the White House, where Mr. Trump had scheduled a series of events to highlight what he said he was doing while the Democrats were focused on impeachment.\n\nThe idea was to embrace the strategy that former president Bill Clinton used during his own impeachment fight. Mr. Clinton described that strategy on CNN on Thursday. \"I would say, \u2018I've got lawyers and staff people handling this impeachment inquiry and they should just have at it,'\" Mr. Clinton said. \"\u2018Meanwhile, I'm going to work for the American people.' That's what I would do.\"\n\nEarly Friday morning, Stephanie Grisham, the White House press secretary, issued a statement saying that Mr. Trump would watch the opening statement by the top Republican on the committee. She added, \"but the rest of the day, he will be working hard for the American people.\"\n\nTo illustrate that, the White House had scheduled an announcement for Friday afternoon on new rules to promote \"honesty and transparency\" in health care prices. But as soon as the event was over, reporters deluged the president with questions \u2014 about his Yovanovitch tweet.\n\nMichael D. Shear is a White House correspondent.

Our partners at PointsBet released odds for James' next team, with the Warriors having the fourth-best odds to land the 19-time All-Star at +1500.\n\n\nThis means that a $100 bet on James joining the Warriors (+1500) would net you $1,500.\n\nJames, who is under contract with the Lakers through next season and has a player option for the 2024-25 season, would have to request a trade out of Los Angeles in order to join another team. The Ringer's Kevin O'Connor speculated in his latest column that interest between James and Golden State could end up being real.\n\n\"Interest between LeBron and the Warriors could be mutual,\" O'Connor wrote. \"LeBron is BFFs with Draymond and he's already said that Steph Curry is the current player he'd most like to play with. Last year on The Shop, LeBron's business partner, Maverick Carter, pushed him to share the team he'd most want to play for other than the Lakers and LeBron said it'd be the Warriors (or the Heat).\"\n\nRELATED: Why Warriors should follow Nuggets' winning example\nThe Warriors trading for James is highly unlikely and would be very complicated for everyone involved. However, until James makes a decision on if, or where, he wants to play next season, the rumors should only intensify.\n\nPointsBet is our Official Sports Betting Partner and we may receive compensation if you place a bet on PointsBet for the first time after clicking our links."

        "text": "A Democratic and a Republican lawmaker looked ahead to the first televised hearings in the impeachment probe and responded on Sunday to the Republican witness requests in interviews on ABC's \"This Week.\"\n\n\"This is a very simple, straightforward act. The president broke the law,\" said Rep. Jackie Speier, D-Calif, a member of the House Intelligence Committee which will conduct this week's public hearings. \"He went on a telephone call with the president of Ukraine and said 'I have a favor though' and then proceeded to ask for an investigation of his rival. This is a very strong case of bribery.\"\n\n\"The Constitution is very clear -- treason, bribery or acts of omission,\" she added. \"And in this case it's clearly one of those.\"\n\nRanking member of the House Armed Services Committee, Rep.

Adam Schiff responded to Republicans in a letter saying that the committee was evaluating the witness list, but said that the impeachment inquiry would not \"serve as vehicles for any Member to carry out the same sham investigations into the Bidens or debunked conspiracies about the 2016 U.S. election interference that President Trump pressed Ukraine to conduct for his personal political benefit.\"\n\nHe also called the original whistleblower's testimony \"redundant and unnecessary\" and said that an appearance would put the whistleblower's personal safety at risk.\n\nOn \"This Week,\" Speier echoed Schiff's comments and said the focus needs to stay on the president's conversation.\n\n\"We want to stay focused on the Ukraine call,\" she said.\n\n\"And having Hunter Biden come in is unrelated to the Ukraine call. And so that becomes irrelevant,\" she added.\n\nThornberry criticized the timing of the inquiry, accusing Democrats of rushing the process so that impeachment does not interfere with early presidential primary challenges.\n\n\"Put everything they've got out there, fine,\" Thornberry said. \"Let the American people decide this in less than a year.\""

        "text": "An army of Confederate monuments dots Virginia's landscape but some of those statues could soon start coming down after Election Day gave Democrats control of the General Assembly for the first time in decades.\n\nMembers of the new legislative majority say they plan to revive proposals to make it easier to remove the public displays honoring Civil War soldiers and generals in a state that was home to two Confederate capitals. Previous attempts to do so were quickly dispatched in the Republican-controlled General Assembly, in votes largely along party lines.\n\n\"This is about what do we remember? What do we honor? It's the right to decide what we celebrate,\" said Del.-elect Sally Hudson, a Democrat whose district includes Charlottesville.\n\nHudson said she plans to reintroduce legislation her predecessor, David Toscano, sponsored, giving cities and counties the ability to remove Confederate monuments.\n\nLocal governments are currently hamstrung by a 1904 state law that protects memorials for war veterans.\n\nThe long-running debate over whether such displays are appropriate in public spaces intensified after white supremacists descended on Charlottesville two years ago, in part to protest the city's attempt to move a statue of Gen. Robert E. Lee. The event descended into chaos and a white supremacist plowed his car into a crowd, killing a woman and injuring dozens more.\n\nIn the aftermath of the violence, many places around the country quickly started taking monuments down, but not in Virginia.\n\nCharlottesville has been fighting a lawsuit, based in part on the 1904 state law, over the city's 2017 decision to remove the Lee statue and its later decision to move another of Thomas \"Stonewall\" Jackson. A judge has prevented their removal for now.\n\nMany lawmakers are likely \"anxious to carry\" legislation to address the issue, said Del. Lamont Bagby, who chairs the Virginia Legislative Black Caucus.\n\n\"I can't imagine we would go through this session without that getting a full hearing,\" Bagby said. \"I suspect that it will be met with success.\"\n\nDemocratic Gov. Ralph Northam suggested at a recent news conference that he'd be open to signing such a bill.\n\n\"My thoughts are that the localities are in the best position to make those decisions and that's what I'll continue to support,\" said Northam, who has said the best place for Confederate monuments is in a museum and vowed on the campaign trail to be a \"vocal advocate\" for that approach.\n\nStill, some supporters of the monuments expressed hope they can work with the new majority.\n\n\"We're not going to run around saying \u2018the sky is falling' until we see something concrete,\" said B. Frank Earnest, heritage defense coordinator for the Virginia division of the Sons of Confederate Veterans, which adamantly opposes the removal of any Confederate monuments.\n\n\"Are we going to naturally assume the Democrats are evil and out to get us? I think they're reasonable people we can deal with,\" said Earnest, who noted that some Democrats have opposed changing the law.\n\nCharlottesville's 2020 legislative priorities include a request that the General Assembly give localities control over Civil War monuments, according to city spokesman Brian Wheeler.\n\n\"The City would welcome any new perspective the next General Assembly might be able to bring to our requests on this matter in the next session,\" Wheeler wrote in an email. Other city governments that have signaled their intent to remove a Confederate monument include Alexandria, Norfolk and Portsmouth.\n\nIn historic Richmond, where five soaring Confederate statues line Monument Avenue, the issue has moved more slowly.\n\nA study commission formed by Mayor Levar Stoney in 2017 issued nonbinding recommendations that called for removing a statue of Jefferson Davis, leaving the rest and adding historical context. That commission's work was then rolled to a second one, which Stoney's spokesman said is currently working on reviewing the contextual part of the recommendations.\n\nRichmond's City Council has also twice rejected a resolution asking the General Assembly for the authority to decide the statues' fate.\n\nAcross the state, officials have catalogued 168 war memorials, 136 of which are dedicated to Confederate participants in the Civil War.\n\nCritics of the monuments see them as a vestige of the South's racist past, while supporters often liken their proposed removal to erasing history. The debate ranges beyond Confederate monuments to a broad discussion of whether it's appropriate to memorialize people who owned slaves or held racist views.\n\nAnother occasional target of criticism is a statue of prominent segregationist Harry F. Byrd Sr., a former Virginia governor and U.S. senator who's considered the architect of the state's \"massive resistance\" policy to public school integration. His figure in bronze stands on the Capitol square.\n\nEarnest, with the Sons of Confederate Veterans, said allowing the removal of Confederate monuments could open the floodgates.\n\n\"Pretty soon you've got a barren landscape with nothing,\" he said.\n\nPhil Wilayto, an activist, community organizer and longtime advocate for a greater memorialization of Richmond's critical role in the international slave trade, called it an embarrassment that Virginia is \"so far behind\" other places.\n\n\"Now that the Democrats have retaken the General Assembly, the pressure should be on Gov. Northam to fulfill his earlier promises from when he was running for governor to do whatever he can to take down these monuments to white supremacy,\" he said."

        "text": "Congress plans to avert a government shutdown Nov. 21 by passing another short-term spending bill into December, setting up a collision with House votes on articles of impeachment against President Trump.\n\nThe new stopgap spending bill, expected to come up for votes next week, would last through Dec. 20, House Appropriations Chairwoman Nita M. Lowey (D-N.Y.) said Tuesday after meeting with Senate Appropriations Chairman Richard C. Shelby (R-Ala.).\n\nBoth lawmakers expressed the hope that the extension would give them more time to come up with a deal that would fund all government operations through Sept. 30, 2020, which is the end of this fiscal year. But key issues remain unresolved, including how much money will go to Trump's U.S.-Mexico border wall.\n\nSenate Republicans have proposed adding an additional $5 billion to the budget for the wall, while House Democrats have proposed zero dollars.\n\nThe new timeline will also put the next shutdown date right in the middle of when the House is expected to be voting on whether to impeach Trump. But the lawmakers said they hope to be able to complete the necessary work of funding the government anyway.\n\nThe White House has expressed support for the December timeline, though Trump tends to hold back formal support for budget deals until lawmakers prepare to vote.\n\nLawmakers had discussed extending funding into early next year. But they were concerned that if they attempted that, the process could falter and they would end up continuing to fund all agencies at current spending levels. That would mean the Pentagon and domestic agencies would have to forgo significant spending increases, an outcome lawmakers of both parties oppose.\n\nThe government is projected to spend roughly $1 trillion more than it brings in from revenue in this fiscal year, in part because both Democrats and Republicans have agreed to increase spending on numerous agencies.\n\nThe White House has made clear that Trump's priority out of spending talks is to get the money he wants for his wall. However, administration officials have also made clear that if Congress doesn't approve the money he wants, Trump is prepared to use executive authority to take money for border barriers from other accounts.\n\nThat's what happened at the beginning of this year, after a record 35-day government shutdown over the wall. Trump declared a national emergency at the border and took $3.6 billion from military construction projects for the wall.\n\nShelby told reporters that he and Trump had discussed wall funding this weekend during a football game at the University of Alabama. The wall has emerged as a major sticking point since lawmakers can't agree to spending levels for other programs without knowing the price tag of the Homeland Security spending bill that funds the wall.\n\n\"That's a good question,\" Shelby told reporters when asked what sort of compromise might emerge on wall funding. \"I think the wall is entwined in all of this to some extent. It's not everything, but it's an important element, and we're mindful of that. We could agree on a lot of things and go nowhere with it, but what we want to do is try to reach an agreement between us that the president will sign on to.\"\n\nShelby ruled out a shutdown when government funding expires next week.\n\n\"I'm confident there won't be a shutdown,\" he said. \"It would be shocking. It would be shocking, devastating and uncalled for.\"\n\nLowey expressed confidence that lawmakers will complete work on the 12 annual must-pass spending bills that fund government agencies by the new Dec. 20 deadline. Congress is responsible for doling out discretionary spending, which makes up about a third of the federal budget and does not include \"mandatory\" programs such as Medicare and Social Security.\n\n\"We are going to get our work done,\" Lowey said."

        "text": "Roger Stone, a longtime friend and ally of President Trump, was found guilty Friday of witness tampering and lying to Congress about his pursuit of Russian-hacked emails damaging to Hillary Clinton's 2016 election bid.\nStone was convicted of all seven counts in an indictment that accused him of lying to Congress, tampering with a witness and obstructing the House investigation into whether the Trump campaign coordinated with Russia to tip the 2016 election.\n\nHe is the sixth Trump aide or advisor to be convicted of charges brought as part of special counsel Robert S. Mueller III's Russia investigation.\n\nStone, 67, showed no visible reaction as the verdict was read aloud, count by count. He's scheduled to be sentenced Feb. 6. He could face up to 20 years. Another former Trump campaign aide, Michael Caputo, was removed from the courtroom by security officers after he turned his back on the jury after the verdict was read.\n\nStone smirked at reporters as he left the courtroom, holding hands with his wife. As he walked out of the courthouse, Stone was asked if he had any comment on the verdict and replied: \"none whatsoever\" before he hopped into a waiting SUV with his wife.\n\nTrump tweeted minutes after the verdict, calling the conviction \"a double standard like never seen before in the history of our Country,\" because his frequent nemeses, including Hillary Clinton, former FBI Director James Comey and \"including even Mueller himself,\" have not been convicted. \"Didn't they lie?\"\n\nIn a trial that lasted about a week, witnesses highlighted how Trump campaign associates were eager to gather information about emails the U.S. says were hacked by Russia and then provided to the anti-secrecy website WikiLeaks.\n\nSteve Bannon, who served as the campaign's chief executive, testified during the trial that Stone had boasted about his ties to WikiLeaks and its founder Julian Assange, alerting them to pending new batches of damaging emails. Campaign officials saw Stone as the \"access point\" to WikiLeaks, he said.\n\nAfter the verdict was read, prosecutors asked for Stone to be jailed as he awaits sentencing, arguing that he may have violated a judge's order that prohibits him from communicating with the media about his case. But Judge Amy Berman Jackson rejected that request and said Stone will be subject to same conditions he faced following his arrest, including the gag order.\n\nThroughout the trial, prosecutors used Stone's own text messages and emails \u2014 some of which appeared to contradict his congressional testimony \u2014 to lay out their case that he lied to Congress and threatened a witness.\n\nOn Tuesday, a top former Trump campaign official, Rick Gates, who was a key cooperator in the Mueller probe, testified that Stone tried to contact Jared Kushner, Trump's son-in-law, to \"debrief\" him about developments on the hacked emails.\n\nProsecutors alleged Stone lied to Congress about his conversations about WikiLeaks with New York radio host and comedian Randy Credico \u2014 who scored an interview with Assange in 2016, when he was avoiding prosecution by sheltering in the Ecuadoran Embassy in London \u2014 and conservative writer and conspiracy theorist Jerome Corsi.\n\nDuring the 2016 campaign, Stone had mentioned in interviews and public appearances that he was in contact with Assange through a trusted intermediary and hinted at inside knowledge of WikiLeaks' plans. But he started pressing Credico to broker a contact, and Credico testified that he told Stone to work through his own intermediary.\n\nEarlier testimony revealed that Stone, while appearing before the House Intelligence Committee, named Credico as his intermediary to Assange and pressured Credico not to contradict him.\n\nAfter Credico was contacted by Congress, he reached out to Stone, who told Credico he should \"stonewall\" the investigation and \"plead the 5th [Amendment],\" he testified. Credico also testified during Stone's trial that Stone repeatedly told him to \"do a \u2018Frank Pentangeli,'\" a reference to a character in the movie \"The Godfather: Part II\" who lies before Congress and later kills himself.\n\nProsecutors said Stone had also threatened Credico's therapy dog, Bianca, saying he was \"going to take that dog away from you.\""

Republicans dismiss that as not credible.\n\nWas Yovanovitch an obstacle to corruption and casualty of a bribery scheme? Or disloyal to a president fully empowered to choose his own ambassadors? And how will Trump and his allies treat what he called \"the woman\" as she speaks out for the first time?\n\nCongress is digging into her testimony on the second day of public impeachment hearings against the nation's 45th president.\n\nHere's what to know:\n\n___\n\nTHEY CALL HER MASHA\n\nExpect to hear extensive details about Yovanovitch's biography as Democrats seek to bolster her credibility and suggest that Trump fired her for being a little too effective at her job.\n\nShe had twice served as an ambassador \u2014 to Kyrgyzstan and to Armenia \u2014 before being confirmed as the U.S. ambassador to Ukraine in a Senate voice vote in July 2016. Yovanovitch, 60, testified on Oct. 11 that she was told that people were \"looking to hurt\" her. One senior Ukraine official said she needed to \"watch my back.\" Asked in the private session whether she felt threatened, Yovanovitch replied, \"Yes.\"\n\nAfter her firing, more of the story began to come out. Yovanovitch said she was told that the State Department had been under pressure from Trump to remove her from Ukraine since the summer of 2018. At the heart of it was president's lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, who told Ukrainian journalists that Yovanovitch was pulled from Kyiv because she was part of efforts against the president.\n\nFull Coverage: Impeachment Hearings\nDuring the private deposition last month, Yovanovitch grew emotional and asked for a break, according to the transcript.\n\nYovanovitch is a career diplomat who served as a principal deputy assistant secretary for the Bureau of European and Eurasian Affairs, a senior adviser and the dean of the language school at the Foreign Service Institute. She is now working as a senior State Department fellow at Georgetown University.\n\n___\n\nTRUMP CALLED HER \"THE WOMAN\"\n\nWatch how Yovanovitch and the president's defenders \u2014 and Trump himself \u2014 interact during the hearing.\n\nThe president had fired Yovanovitch months before the July 25 phone call in which he pressured Ukraine's president on the Bidens. Even though she had been gone for months, Yovanovitch clearly was on the president's mind and connected to his goals in Ukraine. He says he was rooting out corruption generally.\n\n\"The former ambassador from the United States, the woman, was bad news,\" Trump said, according to the rough transcript of the call with Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskiy. \"She's going to go through some things.\"\n\nIt's unclear what he meant, but he says that call was \"perfect.\" But the president has a long history of denigrating women who stand up to him, especially those of his generation in positions of power.\n\nAt a rally in Louisiana just hours before Yovanovitch's testimony, Trump spoke in rare personal terms about his own impeachment journey.\n\n\"Impeachment to me is a dirty word,\" he told his supporters in Bossier City. \"It's been very unfair, very hard on my family.\"\n\n___\n\nRUDY'S FIXERS\n\nListen for mention of Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman, two associates of Giuliani's arrested at an airport last month while trying to leave the country with one-way tickets.\n\nThe businessmen are charged with making illegal campaign contributions while looking to expand their energy business in Ukraine. The core of Giuliani's involvement appears to revolve around his work with them.\n\nSoviet-born Parnas is prepared to cooperate with the impeachment inquiry. He's accused of using foreign money to make illegal campaign contributions while lobbying U.S. politicians to oust Yovanovitch.\n\nParnas's attorney, Joseph Bondy, sent lawmakers a letter saying Parnas is prepared to answer questions and produce documents for the impeachment inquiry as long as they don't step on his Fifth Amendment rights against self-incrimination.\n\n___\n\nNO QUID PRO QUO\n\nThe president and his allies insist there was \"no quid pro quo,\" which is Latin for, roughly, an offer of this for that.\n\nBut quid pro quo is not in the Constitution. \"Bribery\" is specifically spelled out as a potential ground for presidential impeachment.\n\nSo Democrats are shifting to \"bribery\" to describe Trump's conduct, though it's not yet clear whether that charge will form the basis of an article of impeachment.\n\nWhat's certain is that Democrats are focused like a laser on making the case for impeachment clear to Americans in a bid to build up public support.\n\n\"Quid pro quo: Bribery,\" House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said Thursday. \"The bribe is to grant or withhold military assistance in return for a public statement of a fake investigation into elections. That's bribery.\"\n\n___\n\n2020 LOOMS\n\nTrump continued to assail the proceedings as \"a hoax\" on Thursday. House GOP Leader Kevin McCarthy dismissed the witness testimony as hearsay, at best second-hand information.\n\nThe president's re-election campaign says Americans are increasingly behind that defense.\n\nTrump's reelection effort raised more than $3 million on the first day of public impeachment hearings, and campaign manager Brad Parscale announced it now hopes to raise $5 million within a 24-hour span."

        "title": "Day One of the Public Impeachment Hearings",
        "text": "During the first day of public hearings in the impeachment inquiry into the president's conduct regarding Ukraine, the ranking members of the House intelligence committee made several statements that lacked context and required more information.\n\nHouse Democrats launched the public sessions on Nov. 13, with testimony from William Taylor, the charge d'affaires at the U.S. Embassy in Ukraine, and George Kent, deputy assistant secretary for European and Eurasian affairs in the State Department, both of whom had testified previously to House committees behind closed doors. \n\nThe impeachment inquiry was triggered by a whistleblower complaint that accused President Donald Trump of \"using the power of his office to solicit interference from a foreign country in the 2020 U.S. election.\" The complaint cites a July 25 phone call that Trump had with the president of Ukraine, Volodymyr Zelensky, in which Trump asked Zelensky to investigate Democrats and a potential campaign rival, Vice President Joe Biden. At the time of the call, the administration was withholding congressionally appropriated security assistance funding to Ukraine.\n\nDemocratic Rep. Adam Schiff, chairman of the House intelligence committee, and Republican Rep. Devin Nunes, the ranking minority member of the committee, highlighted certain events in their opening statements and their questioning:\n\nNunes said the Obama administration had provided \"blankets\" to Ukraine, not lethal aid. It's true that administration didn't provide lethal weapons, as the Trump administration has. But the Obama administration did provide nonlethal military aid, including training, vehicles and radar equipment.\nNunes said the original whistleblower \"was acknowledged to have a bias against President Trump.\" The intelligence community inspector general said the whistleblower did have \"an arguable political bias,\" but that the whistleblower's complaint \"appears credible.\"\nNunes said the Democrats at a prior hearing gave \"a purely fictitious rendition of the president's phone call\" with Zelensky. He's referring to Schiff, who at the hearing indicated that he was not giving an exact reading of the president's call, but rather \"the essence\" of the president's intentions in \"not so many words.\"\nSchiff said the White House took the \"extraordinary step\" to move a memo of Trump's call with Zelensky to a \"highly classified server.\" It's true that it was placed in a more secure location with restricted access, but a National Security Council staffer said it was not unusual for such calls to be placed in such a system.\nNunes said Democrats want to impeach Trump based on the summary of a \"pleasant\" call between Trump and Zelensky. But there's more to the impeachment inquiry than just the phone call.\nNunes said Democratic committee staffers \"had direct discussions with the whistleblower\" prior to a complaint being filed. The whistleblower contacted the committee and was advised by staff to contact the intelligence community inspector general. But whistleblowers \"typically reach out\" to such committees for advice, a government report has said. \nObama Provided More than \u2018Blankets' to Ukraine\nIn his opening statement, Republican Rep. Devin Nunes dismissed the aid provided to Ukraine by the Obama administration as merely \"blankets.\" While it's true that the Obama administration did not provide lethal weaponry to Ukraine, it did provide hundreds of millions of dollars worth of nonlethal military and security aid, such as military training, communications equipment, vehicles, night-vision goggles and counter-mortar radar to detect incoming artillery fire.\n\nNunes' comment came as he took aim at \"the politicized bureaucracy,\" the \"executive branch employees [who] are charged with implementing the policy set by our president.\"\n\n\"Despite all their dissatisfaction with President Trump's Ukraine policy,\" Nunes said, \"the president approved the supply of weapons to Ukraine, unlike the previous administration, which provided blankets as defense against invading Russians.\"\n\nIt's true that in 2014, Obama balked at providing Ukraine lethal military aid, despite a plea to the U.S. Congress for such assistance by Ukraine's then-President Petro Poroshenko.\n\n\"Blankets and night vision goggles are important, but one cannot win a war with a blanket,\" Poroshenko said then.\n\nBut there was more to the aid than that. According to a Congressional Research Service report in January 2017 \u2014 at the end of the Obama presidency \u2014 the U.S. had committed more than $1.3 billion in foreign assistance to Ukraine since armed hostilities with Russia arose in late 2013. That included more than $600 million since 2014 in security aid, including training, equipment and advisers, the report stated.\n\nIn March 2016 testimony before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, the assistant secretary of State for European and Eurasian Affairs, Victoria Nuland, detailed some of the security aid to Ukraine.\n\nNuland, March 15, 2016: Since there can be no reform in Ukraine without security, over $266 million of our support has been in the security sector, training nearly 1,200 soldiers and 750 Ukrainian National Guard personnel and providing: 130 HMMWVs, 150 thermal goggles and 585 night vision devices, over 300 secure radios, 5 Explosive Ordnance Disposal robots, 20 counter-mortar radars, and over 100 up-armored civilian SUVs. In FY16, we plan to train and equip more of Ukraine's border guards, military, and coast guard to help Ukraine secure its border, defend against and deter future attacks, and respond to illicit smuggling.\n\nNunes is correct that Trump was the first to provide lethal weaponry to Ukraine. In March 2018, the Trump administration approved the sale of $47 million worth of Javelin antitank missiles and launch units.\n\nIn his closed door testimony before Congress (a transcript of which was later released), William Taylor, the charge d'affaires ad interim at the U.S. Embassy in Ukraine, called that a \"substantial improvement\" in aid to Ukraine. Taylor said the \"serious\" weapons would help deter Russians \"from trying to grab more territory.\"\n\n\"There was also a very strong political message that said that the Americans are willing to provide more than blankets,\" Taylor said. (See pages 155-156.)\n\nAsked about his \"blankets\" comment to describe aid provided during the Obama administration, Taylor said it was \"just kind of the more derogatory version of it, but it was nonlethal weapons. So there was communications equipment, there were vehicles, there were maybe some rations, there were blankets, there were night-vision goggles. So it was a significant package, but it stopped short of weapons.\"\n\nWhistleblower Bias?\nNunes also said that the original whistleblower \"was acknowledged to have a bias against President Trump.\" The inspector general of the intelligence community wrote that the whistleblower had \"an arguable political bias \u2026 in favor of a rival political candidate,\" but the IG still concluded, based on his preliminary review, that the whistleblower's complaint \"appears credible.\"\n\nNunes, Nov. 13: The whistleblower was acknowledged to have a bias against President Trump, and his attorney touted a \"coup\" against the president and called for his impeachment just weeks after his election.\n\nWe should note that despite some public speculation, the identity of the whistleblower has not formally been revealed. In his complaint, the whistleblower describes himself only as a \"non-White House official\" who learned about Trump's phone call with the Ukrainian president \"in the course of official interagency business\" from \"[m]ultiple White House officials with direct knowledge of the call.\" The New York Times said the whistleblower is a CIA officer who was detailed to the National Security Council, though the Times did not identify the official by name.\n\nIn an Aug. 26 letter, Michael Atkinson, the inspector general of the intelligence community, noted that his preliminary review found some indication that the whistleblower had \"an arguable political bias.\"\n\nAtkinson, Aug, 26: Further, although the ICIG's preliminary review identified some indicia of an arguable political bias on the part of the Complainant in favor of a rival political candidate, such evidence did not change my determination that the complaint relating to the urgent concern \"appears credible,\" particularly given the other information the ICIG obtained during its preliminary review.\n\nCNN, citing unnamed sources familiar with the investigation, reported that the inspector general's conclusion was based on the whistleblower being a registered Democrat. Three sources who were privy to Atkinson's private House testimony told the Washington Examiner the whistleblower also had some sort of prior working relationship with one of the 2020 Democratic presidential candidates.\n\nOn Oct. 9, the whistleblower's attorneys, Andrew Bakaj and Mark Zaid, released a statement addressing the alleged bias. According to the attorneys, the whistleblower \"has never worked for or advised a political candidate, campaign, or party.\" They noted that the whistleblower \"has spent their entire government career in apolitical, civil servant positions in the Executive Branch\" and that \"in these positions our client has come into contact with presidential candidates from both parties in their roles as elected officials \u2013 not as candidates.\" \n\n\"Finally,\" they wrote, \"the whistleblower is not the story. To date, virtually every substantive allegation has been confirmed by other sources. For that reason the identity of the whistleblower is irrelevant.\"\n\nAs for Nunes' statement that the whistleblower's attorney \"touted a \u2018coup' against the president and called for his impeachment just weeks after his election,\" that refers to a tweet that Zaid sent in response to Trump firing acting Attorney General Sally Yates for refusing to defend Trump's proposed travel ban.\n\nAsked about the tweet, Zaid told Law & Crime: \"In the time since that tweet was posted, which was referring to lawyers serving as the force of good to prevent this president from doing harm to our democracy, I've probably represented more Republicans, including White House officials, than Democrats. This is nothing more than the continuing partisan deflection to desperately avoid discussing the substance of my client's whistleblower complaint.\"\n\nThe \u2018Fictitious Rendition' of the Phone Call\nNunes also referred to an episode in late September in which Schiff gave his own dramatic, and embellished, interpretation of Trump's July 25 phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.\n\nNunes, Nov. 13: At a prior hearing, Democrats on this commitee read out a purely fictitious rendition of the president's phone call with President Zelensky. They clearly found the real conversation to be insufficient for their impeachment narrative, so they just made up a new one.\n\nNunes is talking about Schiff's opening remarks prior to the Sept. 26 testimony of Acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire.\n\nSchiff gave his interpretation of Trump's phone conversation with the Ukrainian president, saying this was \"the essence of what the president communicates\" in his call with Zelensky \"in not so many words.\" Schiff later said in the hearing that the summary he gave \"was meant to be at least part in parody.\"\n\nAs we have written before, Schiff did make up some parts of the conversation, claiming, for example, that Trump told Zelensky, \"you better listen good. I want you to make up dirt on my political opponent.\" The president never asked Zelensky to \"make up dirt\" on Biden, according to the White House memo on the July 25 phone call. Trump asked Zelensky to investigate, not provide false information.\n\nBut not all of Schiff's retelling was \"purely fictitious,\" as Nunes said.\n\nFor instance, Schiff claimed that Trump told Zelensky, \"We've been very good to your country, very good. No other country has done as much as we have. But you know what? I don't see much reciprocity here. I hear what you want. I have a favor I want from you though.\" That is similar to what Trump told Zelensky, according to the White House-released memo.\n\nThe \u2018Highly Classified Server'\nIn his opening statement, Schiff said the White House took the \"extraordinary step\" to move a memo of Trump's call with Zelensky to a \"highly classified server.\"\n\n\"After the call, multiple individuals were concerned enough to report it to the National Security Council's top lawyer,\" Schiff said. \"The White House would then take the extraordinary step of moving the call record to a highly classified server exclusively reserved for the most sensitive intelligence matters.\"\n\nBut Lt. Col. Alexander S. Vindman, a staffer on the White House's National Security Council, testified on Oct. 29 that it was \"not entirely unusual\" for that to happen in the Trump administration.\n\nIn his closed-door testimony, Vindman \u2014 who was on the phone call \u2014 confirmed that the call memo went into a \"more secure system.\" He said, \"As opposed to going into the standard communications system, it went into a different type, a different, more secure system.\"\n\nHe was later asked what it meant for the memo to be placed in the more restricted system.\n\nQuestion, Oct. 29: Does the fact that it was viewed as being sensitive necessarily mean that it was classified, that it should be classified or put into a system for very highly classified information?\n\nVindman: So, sir, I would say that the use of the system is at the discretion oftentimes not of the legal shop or the senior legal counsel; it's oftentimes actually at the discretion of the directors. And if they want to limit access to it, because they think it's sensitive or they don't want it to go out to a broader community, will do that. Whether that's what it was designed for, you know, it seems it might not be, but that's not unusual that something would be put into a more restricted circulation.\n\nLater he was asked if \"any other call transcripts or [meeting] summaries that were placed into the more restricted system?\"\n\n\"I mentioned that, you know, this is not entirely unusual,\" Vindman said. \"It doesn't happen regularly, I think most of these types of things \u2026 occur in the normal channels, but I am aware of other communications that have been \u2014 yeah \u2014 so, without going into the specific incidents, I guess, there are other classified materials.\"\n\nVindman said it may have been justified to put the call memo in a more restricted system, because an information leak could damage U.S.-Ukraine relations.\n\nQuestion: And I'm still trying to understand why it was viewed as being sensitive? Was it sensitive because of national security reasons, or was it sensitive because of other reasons? Was the discussion of the Bidens sensitive to national security, in your mind?\n\nVindman: From a foreign policy professional perspective, all of these types of calls would inherently be sensitive. This one may be more so because it could somehow undermine our relationship with the Ukrainians. So, from that standpoint, you know, I guess \u2013 \u2013 in my mind, it could be justified to put it in the system because, again, if it went out, it could harm our relationship. I think ultimately that call was made \u2014 I'm not Sure \u2014 the call was made by John Eisenberg, the senior NSC lead counsel, and he did it based on his experience and judgment.\n\nIt may be that the Trump administration handles such call memos differently than other administrations. Kelly Magsamen, a former National Security Council staff member under Presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama, wrote in a Washington Post op-ed that moving the call memo to the more restricted system was \"abnormal and suspicious.\"\n\n\"Such special protections are typically reserved for material of the gravest sensitivity: detailed information about covert operations, for example, where exposure can get people killed,\" she wrote.\n\nThe \u2018Perfect Call' Defense\nNunes said Democrats want to impeach Trump based on the summary of a \"pleasant\" call between Trump and Zelensky. But there's more to the impeachment inquiry than just the phone call.\n\nThe impeachment inquiry is gathering evidence on what actions Trump and his aides took before and after the call, including whether the president withheld aid to Ukraine in an effort to pressure Ukrainian to publicly declare that it would investigate the Bidens and alleged Ukraine interference in the 2016 U.S. election.\n\nNunes started off his questioning with a statement: \"The call summary for which the Democrats want to impeach president Trump is dramatically different from their nefarious depiction of it. What it actually shows is a pleasant exchange between two leaders who discuss mutual cooperation over a range of issues. The Democrats claim this call demonstrates extortion, bribery, and a host of other monstrous crimes being committed against President Zelensky.\"\n\nThis mirror's President Trump's \"perfect call\" defense, and his repeated insistence that his innocence would be apparent if people just \"READ THE TRANSCRIPT!\"\n\nWe'll let readers decide whether anything that was in the call summary released by the White House amounts to extortion or bribery.\n\nIn the July 25 call, Trump told Zelensky, \"I will say that we do a lot for Ukraine. We spend a lot of effort and a lot of time. \u2026 The United States has been very \u00b7very good to Ukraine. I wouldn't say that it's reciprocal necessarily because things are happening that are not good but the United States has been very very good to Ukraine.\"\n\nZelensky then thanked Trump for its assistance, and particularly for the impending sale of Javelin missiles.\n\nTrump then said, \"I would like you to do us a favor though because our country has been through a lot and Ukraine knows a lot about it. I would like you to find out what happened with this whole situation with Ukraine, they say CrowdStrike. \u2026 The server, they say Ukraine has it.\" CrowdStrike is the cybersecurity firm hired by the Democratic National Committee after its computer network was hacked by Russian intelligence officers. And Trump is making an apparent reference to the debunked conspiracy theory that Ukrainians, not Russians, hacked the DNC servers.\n\nShortly thereafter, Trump asked Zelensky to meet with his personal attorney Rudy Giuliani and Attorney General William Barr.\n\n\"The other thing,\" Trump continued, \"there's a lot of talk about Biden's son, that Biden stopped the prosecution and a lot of people want to find out about that so whatever you can do with the Attorney General would be great. Biden went around bragging that he stopped the prosecution so if you can look into it \u2026 It sounds horrible to me.\"\n\nAs we've written, Trump has distorted the facts when he has claimed that Joe Biden, as vice president, threatened to withhold \"billions of dollars to Ukraine\" unless it removed the prosecutor general who \"was prosecuting\" Biden's son, Hunter, and Burisma, the Ukrainian gas company on whose board Hunter Biden had served. There's no evidence Hunter Biden was ever being investigated or prosecuted. \n\nAnd, despite Nunes' claim that Democrats want to impeach Trump based solely on the call summary, the House Democrats' inquiry casts a much wider net than that.\n\nGovernment officials who have testified in the House impeachment probe have said that they believe pressure was exerted both before and after the phone call to get Zelensky to make a public statement that he was opening an investigation into Burisma and the Bidens. That pressure, they said, included the withholding of U.S. security aid, and the dangling of a White House visit for Zelensky. To read more about that, read out story, \"What We've Learned From Impeachment Inquiry.\"\n\nWhistleblower Contact with Democrats\nNunes also questioned the motives of the whistleblower and the Democratic impeachment inquiry because of contact that the anonymous whistleblower had with the House intelligence committee prior to filing the Aug. 12 complaint alleging misconduct by Trump.\n\nNunes, Nov. 13: And most egregiously, the staff of the Democrats on this committee had direct discussions with the whistleblower before his or her complaint was submitted to the inspector general. Republicans can't get a full account of these contacts because Democrats broke their promise to have the whistleblower testify to this committee. Democrat members hid these contacts from Republicans and then lied about them to the American people on national television.\n\nThe New York Times broke the story on Oct. 2 that Schiff previously knew about \"the outlines\" of the whistleblower's concerns. The whistleblower had contacted an intelligence committee aide after passing along concerns to the CIA's top lawyer and being \"[c]oncerned about how that initial avenue for airing his allegations through the C.I.A. was unfolding,\" the Times reported.\n\nBut when Schiff was asked about the complaint in a Sept. 17 MSNBC interview, he said, \"We have not spoken directly with the whistleblower.\"\n\nA Democratic committee official previously told us Schiff \"could have been more clear\" but was \"referring to the Committee officially interviewing the whistleblower, and himself personally.\" It was clearly known, however, that the committee hadn't officially interviewed the whistleblower at that time.\n\nPatrick Boland, a spokesman for Schiff and the House intelligence committee, told us in a statement that it is not unusual for whistleblowers to contact the intelligence committee.\n\n\"Like other whistleblowers have done before and since under Republican and Democratic-controlled Committees, the whistleblower contacted the Committee for guidance on how to report possible wrongdoing within the jurisdiction of the Intelligence Community. This is a regular occurrence, given the Committee's unique oversight role and responsibilities,\" he said. \"Consistent with the Committee's longstanding procedures, Committee staff appropriately advised the whistleblower to contact an Inspector General and to seek legal counsel.\"\n\nThere's support for the statement that it's \"a regular occurrence\" for whistleblowers to contact congressional committees. A May 2019 Government Accountability Office report said \"whistleblowers who contact the Congress typically reach out to oversight committees, the offices of their own representatives or senators, or authorizing committees.\"\n\nLater in the Nov.13 hearing, Republican Rep. Jim Jordan went further than Nunes, claiming that Schiff knows the identity of the whistleblower.\n\n\"Of the 435 members in Congress, you are the only member who knows who that individual is, and your staff is the only staff of any member of Congress who's had a chance to talk to that individual,\" Jordan said to Schiff.\n\nThere is no evidence of that, and Schiff denies it.\n\n\"As the gentleman knows, that's a false statement,\" Schiff responded. \"I do not know the identity of the whistleblower and I am determined to make sure that identity is protected.\""

        "text": "President Trump on Friday defended his tweet earlier in the day attacking former U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch in the middle of her public testimony in the House impeachment hearing, insisting he has the right to speak out.\n\n\"I have the right to speak. I have freedom of speech just like other people do,\" Trump told reporters at the White House after making remarks on a health care initiative, adding that he's \"allowed to speak up\" if others are speaking about him.\n\nPressed on whether his words can be intimidating, as Yovanovitch and Democrats have said, Trump said no.\n\n\"I don't think so at all,\" he said.\n\nThe remarks were Trump's first public comments of the day, which has largely been dominated by testimony from Yovanovitch. As the former ambassador testified about a smear campaign by Trump's allies to oust her from her post in Kyiv, the president took aim at her on Twitter.\n\n\"Everywhere Marie Yovanovitch went turned bad. She started off in Somalia, how did that go? Then fast forward to Ukraine, where the new Ukrainian President spoke unfavorably about her in my second phone call with him,\" Trump tweeted. \"It is a U.S. President's absolute right to appoint ambassadors.\"\n\nIn a stunning moment, House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff (D-Calif.) interrupted questioning from his staff counsel to read the president's tweet aloud to Yovanovitch and asked for her reaction.\n\n\"I don't think I have such powers,\" Yovanovitch said with a slight laugh. \"Not in Mogadishu, Somalia, not in other places.\"\n\nAsked what effect Trump's tweet might have on future witnesses facing pressure from the White House not to testify, Yovanovitch described it as \"very intimidating.\"\n\nDemocrats on the committee and elsewhere in the House equated Trump's tweet to witness intimidation and suggested that it could be considered when mulling articles of impeachment later in the process.\n\nThe White House on Friday morning issued a statement that Trump would not be watching Yovanovitch's testimony beyond opening statements. But Trump himself said that he had tuned in.\n\n\"I watched a little bit of it today. I wasn't able to yesterday because we had the president of Turkey here, and I wasn't able to watch much,\" Trump said. \"I watched some of it this morning and I thought it was a disgrace.\"\n\nTrump complained that Republicans were not given a fair shake, referencing an instance where Schiff stopped Rep. Elise Stefanik (R-N.Y.) from questioning Yovanovitch because the rules stipulated that only the ranking member or Republican counsel could ask questions during that period.\n\n\"It's a disgrace and it's an embarrassment to our nation,\" Trump said.\n\nYovanovitch is the third witness to testify publicly in the House impeachment inquiry. Several other current and former administration officials are scheduled to give public testimony next week."

        "text": "Legislation that would reduce both city and state taxes on a Chicago casino was introduced in the state Senate on Wednesday, but it remained unclear whether lawmakers will come through this week on Mayor Lori Lightfoot's request for a tax structure that would be more appealing to potential investors.\n\nSenate President John Cullerton put forth a compromise proposal Wednesday, but Lightfoot still needs to win more support from House Democrats if a bill is going to make it out of the General Assembly before its scheduled adjournment Thursday.\n\nDemocratic Rep. Bob Rita of Blue Island, the lead negotiator on gambling issues in the House, said he's still working to see whether there are enough votes to move forward before lawmakers leave town.\n\nWhile most House Democrats want the Chicago casino to succeed, Rita said, there are concerns that it could steal business from both proposed and existing casinos in surrounding suburbs. And some Democrats have raised questions about how revenue from the casino would be allocated to building projects under Gov. J.B. Pritzker's $45 billion \"Rebuild Illinois\" infrastructure plan.\n\nSign up for The Spin to get the top stories in politics delivered to your inbox weekday afternoons.\n\nCullerton said during a committee meeting on Wednesday that it was important for the Senate to advance the new bill, which encapsulates a compromise that was negotiated by the city and Pritzker's office.\n\nThe House was slated to take up the bill first, but Cullerton said \"that seemed to have slowed down,\" so he decided to move the measure in the Senate first, he said after the Senate Executive Committee meeting on Wednesday.\n\n\"They could take a Senate bill over there, look at my roll call, see that it can pass the Senate, the state reps could see that their senator voted for it, and they could call it and we could pass it in one day,\" Cullerton said after the Senate Executive Committee meeting on Wednesday.\n\nCullerton thinks the tax rates in his proposal \"definitely should\" see support from Downstate lawmakers, he said.\n\n\"It helps the whole state get a lot of money from the Chicago casino to pay for the capital bill,\" Cullerton said.\n\nThe full Senate was poised to take up the bill late Wednesday but adjourned without taking action as the city continued to negotiate.\n\nLightfoot is pushing to reduce proposed state and city taxes on the Chicago casino after a consultant's report this summer said the tax structure approved by legislators this spring was \"very onerous\" and could deter developers.\n\nCullerton's proposal would do away with the city's 33.3% tax on post-payout revenue from the casino in favor of graduated rates on post-payout revenue from slot machines and table games. A similar structure is in place for state taxes at the 10 existing casinos and the six new ones lawmakers approved in a large-scale gambling expansion this summer. But the new plan would reduce the state's cut.\n\nFor example, while any other casino in the state would pay a 15% state tax on slot machine revenue up to $25 million, the Chicago casino would pay 12% to the state and 10.5% to the city. Other towns with casinos get a 5% cut of post-payout revenue, and some have to share that with neighboring communities.\n\nRepublican Sen. Dave Syverson of Rockford decried the proposal as a special deal for Chicago that would deprive the state of $140 million in annual revenue for building projects across Illinois.\n\n\"How do we tell all these other communities that have gaming in economically depressed areas that are struggling that Chicago's going to get a better deal with paying the state than everyone else?\" said Syverson, a longtime proponent of the Rockford casino authorized in the gambling expansion law.\n\nSupporters of overhauling the tax structure argue that without the change, there might not be a Chicago casino at all, and in turn significantly less revenue for building projects.\n\nWithout a Chicago casino, the buildings portion of the infrastructure plan would be \"destitute, in my mind,\" said state Sen. Terry Link, the Vernon Hills Democrat who was a longtime advocate for the gambling expansion and one of the primary architects of the gambling expansion bill the Illinois General Assembly approved in the spring.\n\n\"The most important part is to get these casinos in operation, get them moving,\" which would benefit the whole state, Link said."

        "title": "Despite scandal, lawmakers vote to block Illinois Gaming Board from preventing video gambling owners from selling without approval",
        "text": "Less than a week after the Illinois Gaming Board attempted to stop video gambling operators from selling their businesses without state approval, a panel of lawmakers in Springfield blocked the move.\n\nThe General Assembly's Joint Committee on Administrative Rules voted 10-0 against the Gaming Board on Tuesday, rejecting the gambling regulators' rationale for making the rule change on an emergency basis.\n\nGaming Board staff viewed their measure as an emergency step in response to the Tribune's revelations last month about Rick Heidner, whose Gold Rush Gaming is one of the state's largest operators. Regulators argued they needed to close a loophole in state law that allows video gambling operators to sell their businesses without Gaming Board approval. The status quo would allow a business owner facing a misconduct investigation to sell the business at a profit without facing state disciplinary action.\n\nRepublican Rep. Keith Wheeler of Oswego, the committee co-chairman, introduced the motion to vote on the issue Tuesday. He said he agrees that the state should close the loophole but said committee members are frustrated because they believe the Gaming Board is using the emergency rule-making process inappropriately.\n\n\"There have been a series of rules promulgated by the Gaming Board under the guise of emergency rules that have not met the threshold,\" Wheeler said.\n\nSince late June, he has reported receiving $6,000 in campaign contributions from Heidner's businesses. Asked about those contributions Tuesday, Wheeler said he planned to donate the money to Mutual Ground, a women's shelter in Aurora.\n\n\"With all that (the Tribune) has exposed, it's going to a charity,\" he said.\n\nTwo Democrats on the panel, co-Chairman Sen. Don Harmon of Oak Park and Sen. Tony Munoz of Chicago, also have received campaign donations from Heidner's businesses in recent years. Both lawmakers abstained from Tuesday's vote.\n\nWheeler said he's trying to meet Thursday with Gaming Board staff to reach an understanding about how to proceed. \"I want to see that changed,\" he said. \"On its face, it makes more sense to (require prior Gaming Board approval).\"\n\nHowever, Wheeler added that he has heard from industry groups that such a change would harm their businesses. He mentioned the Illinois Gaming Machine Operators Association voicing such concerns. The lobbying group has given Wheeler's campaign fund $2,000 since 2018.\n\nThe Gaming Board issued a statement Tuesday contending that the panel of lawmakers was going out of its way to create an \"adversarial relationship\" with the board and to undermine efforts to regulate the industry.\n\n\"Suspension of the emergency rule undermines the IGB's regulatory efforts at a critical moment in gaming expansion. The very foundation of gaming regulation is knowledge of who holds ownership of gaming interests,\" wrote Gaming Board Administrator Marcus Fruchter.\n\nState law \"authorizes an agency to adopt an emergency rule if it finds that a situation exists constituting a threat to the public interest, safety, or welfare. The board unanimously found that the rule regulating the transfer of ownership interests of a terminal operator met these stringent requirements,\" Fruchter wrote.\n\nDuring last week's Gaming Board meeting, a staff attorney told the board that recent revelations about a video gaming operator had created an urgent need to change the rule.\n\n\"The urgency of the situation is magnified by recent news reports of alleged past questionable practices and potential illegal activity,\" attorney Dan Gerber said at the meeting.\n\nIn October, the Tribune reported that Heidner won a 2012 video gambling license from the Gaming Board despite being in business with a convicted illegal sports bookmaker as well as a banker accused by the FBI of involving organized crime figures in a casino deal.\n\nSince at least 2003, Heidner has formed a series of corporations to hold real estate with Parkway Bank Chairman Rocco Suspenzi, whom the FBI and the Gaming Board in 2003 accused of bringing organized crime figures into secret ownership stake in the Rosemont casino project. In addition, Heidner and convicted bookie Dominic Buttitta own a building that is leased to an Elgin bar that's a venue for Gold Rush video gambling machines.\n\nThrough a spokesman, Heidner has said he has no intention of giving up control of his business.\n\nHeidner spokesman Randall Samborn said Tuesday that Heidner has given campaign contributions to numerous lawmakers over the years and the donations were all \"above board.\"\n\n\"Rep. Wheeler, of course, is free to do whatever he wishes with the contributions, and the charities he chooses will benefit,\" Samborn said. \"Mr. Heidner is confident that when the full story is reported, it will show that he has nothing to hide and has done nothing wrong.\"\n\nHeidner also had plans to build a harness racing track and casino in Tinley Park on state-owned land. Following the Tribune story and Heidner's name surfacing in federal search warrants, Gov. J.B. Pritzker's administration said the land was no longer for sale."

        "text": "A notable Kentucky politician has weighed in on the apparent defeat of Republican incumbent Gov. Matt Bevin to Democratic challenger Andy Beshear in last week's gubernatorial election.\n\nAppearing on \"Meet the Press\" Sunday, U.S. Sen. Rand Paul said that the \"teachers' anger came out\" in the election and swung the election in favor of Beshear.\n\nThe Kentucky senator was referring to Bevin's longstanding dispute with teachers across the commonwealth, which was sparked by the governor's overhaul of the pension system. \n\n\"I think the teachers were very unhappy,\" Paul said. \"(Bevin) tried to fix the pension, but got crossways with the teachers. And I think the teachers' anger came out.\"\n\n'I knew he was in big trouble':An inside look at 24 crazy hours in Bevin vs. Beshear\n\nPaul said that Bevin \"was trying to do the right thing\" with pension overhaul. But the governor's lack of popularity with teachers runs much deeper than policy differences. Bevin repeatedly criticized educators who opposed his efforts and said teachers' decision to protest en masse at the state Capitol one day in April 2018 led to children being sexually assaulted or otherwise harmed.\n\n\"I guarantee you somewhere in Kentucky today, a child was sexually assaulted that was left at home because there was nobody there to watch them,\" Bevin said. \"I guarantee you somewhere today, a child was physically harmed or ingested poison because they were left alone because a single parent didn't have any money to take care of them.\"\n\nOverall, Paul said that Bevin's loss is not indicative of a problem for the Republican Party in the Bluegrass State and pointed to GOP candidates winning five of six statewide races.\n\n\"(Republicans) beat a lot of other candidates that no one expected us to,\" Paul said. \"So actually, in many ways, there was sort of a red wave in Kentucky.\"\n\nThe election drama is still ongoing. Alleging \"a number of significant irregularities,\" Bevin formally requested an official recanvass last week of the results of Kentucky's election for governor. That process will take place on Thursday."

        "title": "Close Election in Kentucky Was Ripe for Twitter, and an Omen for 2020",
        "text": "A few hours after polls closed in Kentucky last Tuesday, a Twitter user writing under the handle @Overlordkraken1 posted a message to his 19 followers saying he had \"just shredded a box of Republican mail-in ballots.\"\n\nIt was clear that the Kentucky governor's race was going to be excruciatingly close, and that the Republican incumbent, Matt Bevin, could be headed to defeat. But just in case anyone missed the significance of the destroyed-ballots claim, @Overlordkraken1 added a final touch to his tweet: \"Bye-Bye Bevin,\" he wrote.\n\nFor those eager to cry fraud as a reliably red state leaned blue, the fact that @Overlordkraken1 did not appear to be in Kentucky \u2014 Louisville was misspelled in the location tag on his tweet, for one thing \u2014 was not going to get in the way of a useful narrative. Nor was Twitter's decision to suspend his account.\n\nWithin hours of @Overlordkraken1's tweet, as it became apparent that Mr. Bevin was trailing in the vote tally, hyperpartisan conservatives and trolls were pushing out a screenshot of the message, boosted by what appeared to be a network of bots, and providing early grist for allegations of electoral theft in Kentucky. High-profile right-wing figures were soon tweeting out their own conspiracy theories about the election being stolen \u2014 messages that were in turn pushed by even more trolls and bots \u2014 and the Bevin campaign began talking about \"irregularities\" in the vote without offering any specifics or evidence.\n\nThe talk has only intensified in the days since, though it has yet to be matched by any evidence of actual election rigging. But with Mr. Bevin's choosing not to concede, and Kentucky authorities' preparing to recanvass all of the votes at his insistence, Kentucky is shaping up to be a case study in the real-world impact of disinformation \u2014 and a preview of what election-security officials and experts fear could unfold a year from now if the 2020 presidential election comes down to the wire.\n\nSince his election four years ago, Mr. Bevin has hitched himself to President Trump, and his allegations of irregularities echo the Trump playbook. Mr. Trump has sown doubts about a \"rigged election\" system since before his own election, including openly questioning the mail-in ballot process in Colorado. He then contended that fraud had lost him the popular vote (which Hillary Clinton won by 2.9 million votes). And he has amplified similar theories while in office, tweeting at least 40 times about unfounded voter fraud allegations, according to an analysis by The New York Times, including a claim after the midterm elections last year that \"many ballots are missing or forged\" in Florida.\n\nSuch divisive rhetoric after close elections has always risked shaking public faith in essential democratic institutions. But in a profoundly polarized country where narrow margins are hardly uncommon, sophisticated networks of social media users \u2014 human and bot \u2014 can quickly turn partisan rancor into grave threats, rapidly amplifying disinformation and creating an initial veneer of vast discord that can eventually become self-fulfilling.\n\n\"It shows how the same divisions that the Russians sought to expose in 2016 remain real vulnerabilities in our democracy,\" said Laura Rosenberger, director of the Alliance for Securing Democracy, a nonpartisan group in Washington focused on election security. \"The ugly partisanship that is dominating our democratic discourse continues to create openings for those who want to weaken our institutions and use the online space to fuel conspiracies or advance their own agenda.\"\n\nMr. Bevin has not elaborated on the nature or source of the perceived irregularities, and his campaign did not respond to multiple requests for comment.\n\nThe campaign of Attorney General Andy Beshear, who is leading the governor by roughly 5,000 votes, said in a statement that \"it's deeply concerning to see shady coordinated disinformation campaigns trying to undermine our democracy.\"\n\nThe Spread of Misinformation and Falsehoods\nConspiracy Theories: As Gov. Ron DeSantis of Florida explores a bid for the Republican presidential nomination, he is finding that the outlandish attacks that former President Donald Trump and his allies have aimed at rivals for years are coming for him as well.\nA Hub for Conspiracy Theories: The Denver airport is a magnet for tall tales inspired by the paranormal \u2014 and an experiment into whether, sometimes, institutional fabulism can just be fun.\nClimate Lies: In 2021, Google said that it would stop running ads alongside content that denied climate change. But a report shows that one of its platforms, YouTube, has continued to profit from videos pushing misinformation on the topic.\nTwitter: The elimination of the blue check marks has convulsed the platform as information becomes increasingly unreliable and accounts impersonating public figures proliferate.\nThe Kentucky secretary of state's office said federal law enforcement officials were investigating both the tweet about shredding ballots and the subsequent rapid amplification. The United States attorney's office for the Eastern District of Kentucky did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nTwitter, in response to questions from The Times, said the trolling and spread of disinformation about the Kentucky race appeared scattershot and haphazard, but largely appeared to originate in the United States. The company described @Overlordkraken1, whose profile said his name was Luis, as a user with a history of small-time trolling.\n\nGraphika, a company that specializes in analyzing social media, agreed with the conclusion that much of the activity around the Kentucky vote was domestic and not likely to have been pushed by any foreign power. Graphika said the tweets about electoral fraud appeared to land in what it calls a \"Trump core\" \u2014 a large number of highly interconnected social media accounts, many run by real people, that are typically reactive and loud and can keep a conversation going for days at a time.\n\nBut much like the Russian-backed networks of bots and trolls that impersonated Black Lives Matter activists in 2016, or more recently seized on divisive issues like gun rights after a mass shooting, the accounts that quickly amplified doubts and disinformation about the Kentucky election seemed ready for the occasion.\n\nThe tweet about the shredded ballots was first noticed by the secretary of state's office, which alerted law enforcement officials and Twitter. The tweet was quickly taken down, but by then it had already been captured in a screenshot and would be widely shared.\n\nData compiled by VineSight, a start-up that detects disinformation on social media, showed that many of the accounts that tweeted the screenshot of @Overlordkraken1's ballot-shredding claim appeared to be bots. Their tweets, in turn, were spread by other bots.\n\nOf the more than 3,800 accounts that VineSight detected tweeting the screenshot, at least 2,350 appeared to be bots, based on an analysis of the accounts' activities, including how quickly and how often they tweet.\n\nOne was an account that went by the handle @ConservaMomUSA and had both human and bot characteristics. @ConservaMomUSA's post about the ballot shredding was retweeted about 1,300 times, and nearly 60 percent of that traffic was from bots, VineSight found.\n\nThe volume of bot-like tweets of the vote-shredding screenshot prompted VineSight to alert the Democratic Governors Association in Washington. Despite growing fears about national disinformation campaigns, the news startled some officials there.\n\n\"I was a little surprised,\" said David Turner, the group's communications director. He noted that while some small-scale bot activity had been detected after the 2017 elections in Virginia, \"we didn't see any of that in our close elections last year.\"\n\nThe disinformation quickly grew beyond the allegation of shredded ballots. The conspiratorial hashtag #StopTheSteal, which had been prevalent in the 2018 midterm elections, then silent for nearly a year, spiked late on election night, tweeted more than 1,200 times, largely by accounts with bot-like characteristics.\n\nTweets explicitly claiming that the election had been \"rigged\" were also picked up. A quick sample of nine tweets decrying a \"rigged\" election were retweeted roughly 1,800 times, with nearly 60 percent of the retweets coming from bot-like accounts, according to data compiled by VineSight.\n\nOther bot-like accounts were resurfacing unfounded allegations of \"voter intimidation\" by George Soros, the billionaire Democratic donor and favorite boogeyman of the far right.\n\nTalk of possible electoral fraud was not limited to the fringes of online discourse. Tom Fitton of Judicial Watch, a prominent right-wing activist group, tweeted that Kentucky had weak voter ID laws and \"dirty election rolls,\" though he was careful not to make any direct allegation of wrongdoing.\n\nMichael Coudrey, an entrepreneur and activist with more than 180,000 Twitter followers, posted a message on Wednesday that Kentucky had switched to machines that scanned votes and provided no paper backup, and \"oddly enough the entire state turns blue.\"\n\nIn an email responding to questions from The Times, Mr. Coudrey said warnings from federal officials about possible foreign interference in elections made Kentucky's use of scannable voting machines a cause for concern. Still, he later deleted the tweet after it became apparent that Republicans had scored significant wins in the state.\n\nBut by then it had been retweeted hundreds of times.\n\n\"Now we see as a reality that Kentucky was prime fertile breeding ground to amplify tactics that have previously been used in the 2016 election, and try out new tactics that I do believe will most likely continue to be used in the 2020 election,\" said Alison Lundergan Grimes, the Kentucky secretary of state, a Democrat who ran unsuccessfully in 2014 against Senator Mitch McConnell, the majority leader. She said it foreshadowed \"what is to come in elections not only here in the Commonwealth, but all across this nation.\"\n\nBy Thursday, the online campaign was melding with real-world action. A supporter of Mr. Bevin, Frank Simon, had set up a robocall network telling people to \"please report suspected voter fraud\" to the state Department of Elections.\n\nThere are no indications of any voter fraud in Kentucky, according to Ms. Grimes.\n\n\"Beyond the routine calls that we field, up to and on Election Day, there are no irregularities that would substantiate a 5,000-vote difference margin that now separates unofficially Governor-elect Beshear with Governor Bevin,\" she said.\n\nWhile the Kentucky election, held in an off-year, remains a sideshow to most people outside the state, election security experts see in it a worrying sign of what Americans may be forced to contend with next November.\n\nA situation like Kentucky's, but on a national scale, would at the very least leave the government \"paralyzed in terms of any real policy, domestically or abroad,\" said George Beebe of the Center for the National Interest, a conservative think tank in Washington.\n\n\"We are not going to be able to actually do things,\" Mr. Beebe said. \"It's going to be a challenge, I think, to hold things together. Where this is pointing is a crisis of systemic legitimacy.\""

Another man talked about how he and his wife are both battling Lyme's Disease and the bills that come with it. A woman shared her fears of going broke as she pays for her husband's care while he suffers dementia. They were all part of a few dozen people assembled around U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, a Democratic presidential candidate, at a Monday campaign event in Des Moines.\n\nSanders spent much of the time listening to stories of people struggling with the cost of health care, a problem Sanders says that he can eliminate if the country adopts his Medicare for All plan. \"The day will come soon that health care will be a right for everyone in this country,\" Sanders told the crowd.\n\nHe refrained from criticizing fellow candidate, U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts. But he did draw a distinction, since she is also campaigning on Medicare for All. \"Senator Warren and I both support the legislation that I wrote. And that is the only way we go forward to guarantee quality health care to all people and save the average person money,\" Sanders explained, \"She has a different way to fund it than I do. I think mine is a little bit better. She will probably argue with me.\"\n\nBoth candidates call for raising taxes on the wealthy and big corporations to help raise the tens of trillions of dollars that would be needed to turn over almost all of the health care system to the federal government. Warren maintains that she won't have to raise taxes on the middle class to offset a system where Americans would no longer have to pay insurance premiums and deductibles. Sanders believes raising taxes on the middle class would be necessary to pay for the program. He cited an example of what to expect saying a family making $60,000 a year would pay $1,200 in federal taxes under his plan."

Bernie Sanders of Vermont. No other candidate reached double digits. \n\nWarren said her Iowa strategy was born out of the decision to run a grassroots campaign. Instead of holding private fundraisers, she decided to spend time on the ground and in town halls, she said. \n\n<iframe id=\"google_ads_iframe_7103/ia-desmoines-C1150/native-article_link/news/politics/features_iowacaucus_1\" name=\"google_ads_iframe_7103/ia-desmoines-C1150/native-article_link/news/politics/features_iowacaucus_1\" title=\"3rd party ad content\" width=\"3\" height=\"3\" scrolling=\"no\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" frameborder=\"0\" role=\"region\" aria-label=\"Advertisement\" tabindex=\"0\" data-load-complete=\"true\" data-google-container-id=\"3\" data-integralas-id-7b617edf-8a00-8c0e-27be-344ba01924ba=\"\" style=\"border: 0px; vertical-align: bottom;\"></iframe>\"(I decided) I was going to take the money that came in and put it right back into organizing and to hiring a paid organizing staff so that volunteers have a place to go, so they have a way to get connected.

To overhaul America's tax system. To get corruption out of politics. \n\nBut before she takes the stage, whoever introduces her makes a promise: Every person who wants a photo with the senator will get a photo. And at every campaign stop in Iowa, she stays until the last person in line gets their shot. \n\nThe \"selfie line\" \u2014 this is Warren's phrasing, though it's actually a photo taken by another human, therefore, not a selfie \u2014 is highly organized.\n\nAt least eight staffers or volunteers usher people through the line. Each interaction takes less than 10 seconds, but can have a lasting impact on the candidate's supporters. \n\n\"You don't have to hustle and bustle and try to elbow your way through a crowd to have a moment to ask a question or a moment to get a photo,\" said Michelle Mouton, a professor at Cornell College at a Warren house party in Mount Vernon.\n\nMouton, who has yet to decide for whom she'll caucus in February, posted her photo with Warren on Facebook. She, like others before her and others after her, also asked the senator a question. \n\nIt's in these selfie lines where Warren says she's able to connect with her supporters in a different way than her competitors do.\"For me, you know, because I do the selfie lines, it's often the people who come through and get to say just to me, 'Here's what I want you to hear,'\" Warren said.\n\nEarlier that week, in Indianola, Warren said a couple explained to her they had amassed $100,000 in medical bills when he developed an aneurysm and she was diagnosed with cancer, even though they had \"gold-plated\" health insurance. They asked her to keep fighting for \"Medicare for All,\" she said. \n\n\"It's a lot of individual stories I get to hear,\" Warren said. \n\nHer campaign team estimates she's taken more than 10,000 selfies in Iowa. \n\n## '2 cents' \n\nWhat started at the [Des Moines Register Political Soapbox at the Iowa State Fair](https://www.desmoinesregister.com/story/news/elections/presidential/caucus/2019/08/10/elizabeth-warren-election-2020-iowa-state-fair-register-soapbox-caucus-wealth-tax-corruption-loan/1881764001/) has now become a rally cry from supporters at Warren's events.

Then she launches into the systemic reason for the problem, her plan to fix it, and how she will pay for it. \n\nWarren has created a [policy-rich campaign](https://www.desmoinesregister.com/story/news/elections/presidential/caucus/2019/04/27/2020-election-iowa-caucuses-candidate-elizabeth-warren-policies-child-care-presidential-campaign/3564057002/) focused on \"rewriting the basic rules in our economy\" that she says now favor the wealthy and leaves behind working families.

That same week, she made her first trip to Iowa, [announced she had hired four of the state's top Democratic political operatives](https://www.desmoinesregister.com/story/news/elections/presidential/caucus/2019/02/07/elizabeth-warren-iowa-caucuses-staff-2020-campaign-jason-noble-juliana-amin-daniel-wasta-president/2795907002/) and then quickly built one of the state\u2019s largest organizing teams.\n\n\"If she ends up winning this, one of the factors very well may be that she took the time to recruit top talent and have that talent in place and focused on a plan before announcing,\" said [Matt Paul](https://features.desmoinesregister.com/news/politics/50-most-wanted/matt-paul-election-2020-iowa-caucus-democrats-key-people-to-know), a Des Moines operative who ran Hillary Clinton\u2019s 2016 Iowa caucus campaign but does not have a favorite for 2020. \"That continues to pay dividends.\"\n\nBagniewski, the Polk County Democrats chair, said Warren's focus on organization has continued in the 11 months since. The local party affiliate asked all Democratic campaigns for help finding 40 precinct captains for caucus night. Warren's campaign was the only one to offer volunteers \u2014 and her staff found 20 people in fewer than 48 hours, he said.\n\n\"Their organization is one of the best in the field, if not the best,\" he said. \"They're very conscientious and thoughtful on the way they give back to the party and their community.\"\n\nThe campaign's on-the-ground organizing \u2014 canvassing every weekend, \"Pints and Policy\" discussions, game nights, a community garden and phone banking \u2014 also caught the eye of Our Iowa Values, a Republican-leaning Super PAC. \n\n\"Elizabeth Warren has earned her place in the polls,\" the organization [tweeted](https://twitter.com/OurIowaValues/status/1163501607222423552?s=20) in August. \"Iowa Values has been running a massive field effort across Iowa since our launch and we have only run into canvassers from one campaign anywhere in the state \u2014 Warren for President.\"\n\nHer campaign focuses on organizing at major candidate events in Iowa, too. At the [Polk County Steak Fry](https://www.desmoinesregister.com/picture-gallery/news/elections/presidential/caucus/2019/09/21/polk-county-democrats-steak-fry-2020-candidates-iowa/2400863001/), Warren's team turned the rally site outside the venue into an \"organizing HQ,\" where the staff trained volunteers to canvass the crowds inside. \n\nWarren volunteers bearing clipboards and trailing \u201cliberty green\u201d floating balloons fanned out across the massive event space. (Sanders' campaign took a similar approach at that event, but knocked on area doors instead.) \n\nAt the Iowa Democratic Party's Liberty and Justice Celebration on Nov. 1, the campaign team participated early in the day in sign wars and loud chants. But it also used the opportunity to host a caucus-night training for its supporters gathered from across the state. \n\nWarren made a surprise visit to thank volunteers for knocking on doors, making phone calls and engaging people in conversation while in line at the grocery store.\n\n\"Every time you do that, you not only add to our campaign, you not only increase our chances that we win come November 2020 \u2014 you repair a little thread of democracy,\" she said. \"I'm so deeply proud of what we\u2019re doing together.\""

        "text": "The Florida House is looking at eliminating a powerful state commission that drew criticism last year when it put on the 2018 ballot constitutional amendments made up of unrelated topics.\n\nThe House Civil Justice Subcommittee on Thursday overwhelmingly backed a pair of proposals (HJR 301 and HB 303) that would seek voter approval in 2020 to abolish the Constitution Revision Commission.\n\nThe panel drew bipartisan scorn for the way it put seven amendments on the November 2018 ballot.\n\nThe House proposals are filed for consideration during the 2020 legislative session, which starts Jan. 14. A similar proposal to abolish the Constitution Revision Commission during the 2019 session passed the Senate but died in the House.\n\nHouse sponsor Brad Drake, R-Eucheeanna, said he remains encouraged about the prospects of eliminating what he believes has become a \"dangerous\" commission.\n\n\"I think we've got a good shot,\" Drake said after Thursday's meeting. \"What happened last year, it got caught in the bundle\" of bills as the legislative session ended.\n\nRep. Ben Diamond, a St. Petersburg Democrat who voted against both bills Thursday, argued the commission retains value.\n\n\"I'm not comfortable with the idea of just abolishing the commission,\" Diamond said. \"I think the commission should serve a purpose in addressing long-term issues with our state Constitution that need to be addressed.\"\n\nDiamond supports different proposals that would impose a single-subject requirement on any amendment placed on the ballot by the commission or the state Taxation and Budget Reform Commission (SJR 176 and SJR 396).\n\nBoth commissions meet every 20 years and have the power to propose constitutional amendments for voter approval.\n\nThe commission in 2018 made decisions such as combining in one amendment a ban on vaping in workplaces and a ban on offshore oil drilling. Critics said voters could support one issue in an amendment and oppose another issue in the same amendment.\n\nIt also tied together issues such as crime victims' rights and the mandatory retirement age for judges and the governance of the state college system and death benefits for survivors of first responders and military members."

        "title": "New poll shows Buttigieg in the lead in Iowa. Can he win it all?",
        "text": "When Pete Buttigieg, the 37-year-old openly gay mayor of the fourth-largest city in Indiana, announced his presidential campaign in April, he was the longest of long shots to win the Democratic nomination.\n\nBut now Buttigieg is one of the few remaining Democrats with a path to victory, a path that is getting clearer day by day.\n\nOn Tuesday Monmouth University released a blockbuster new poll showing Buttigieg leading the field in Iowa for the first time. According to Monmouth, 22 percent of likely caucus-goers now list Buttigieg as their top choice, putting him 3 points ahead of former Vice President Joe Biden (19 percent), 4 points ahead of Sen. Elizabeth Warren (18 percent) and 9 points ahead of Sen. Bernie Sanders (13 percent).\n\nMonmouth previously surveyed the Hawkeye State in August, after Buttigieg's initial bump but before his recent effort to rebrand himself as a kind of Goldilocks candidate for wavering Dems: less status quo than Biden, more pragmatic than Warren, and a safer bet than either of them to beat President Trump next November. The August poll found Buttigieg at 8 percent \u2014 meaning that he's gained 14 points in Iowa over the last three months.\n\n\"Buttigieg is emerging as a top pick for a wide variety of Iowa Democrats,\" said Patrick Murray, director of the independent Monmouth University Polling Institute. \"You really can't pigeonhole his support to one particular group. He is doing well with voters regardless of education or ideology.\"\n\nCritics will be quick to dismiss Monmouth as just one poll among many. But there are two reasons they should take it seriously. First, Murray is widely considered one of the best pollsters in the business; according to Nate Silver at FiveThirtyEight, Monmouth is one of only six \"A+\" rated polling outfits currently surveying American public opinion. Second, Monmouth isn't the only poll showing a Buttigieg surge where it matters most, in key early states.\n\nIn Iowa, Buttigieg has long been outperforming his national polling average, which is currently hovering around 8 percent. In late September he leapt into double digits; in mid-October he passed Sanders and moved into third place.\n\nBut in the last two weeks he has picked up momentum in the state. Three high-quality Iowa polls have come out this month: Monmouth, Quinnipiac and New York Times/Siena College. All three show Buttigieg in either first or a statistical tie for second place, and together they have established a clear trend line in the overall Iowa polling average. Since the last Democratic debate, on Oct. 15 \u2014 the one where Buttigieg reintroduced himself as a scrappier, more passionate proponent of Midwestern center-left pragmatism, to rave reviews \u2014 Warren has fallen by about 2 points overall; Biden has fallen by about 4 points; and Buttigieg has risen by about 6 points. The Hoosier is now within 0.4 points, on average, of overtaking Warren.\n\nAnd Iowa isn't the only place where Buttigieg is gaining ground. The lone New Hampshire poll released so far this month, by Quinnipiac, shows him at 15 percent in a three-way statistical tie with Warren and Sanders for second place.\n\nThe likeliest explanation for Buttigieg's ascent is that he's benefiting from widespread anxiety among rank-and-file Democrats about the general election prospects of Warren (too far left) and Biden (not sharp enough) \u2014 an anxiety that is more pronounced in places like Iowa and New Hampshire, where voters are currently paying much closer attention than their counterparts elsewhere. That may be why Monmouth's new Iowa poll found that Buttigieg boasts the best favorability rating in the field (73 percent favorable versus 10 percent unfavorable), whereas net favorability ratings (favorability minus unfavorability) for Biden and Warren have declined since August by 13 points and 16 points, respectively.\n\nMeanwhile, Buttigieg is alone among the alternatives to Warren, Biden and Sanders in having the money and organization to actually compete going forward. After two stellar fundraising quarters, the South Bend mayor entered the homestretch with more cash on hand ($23.4 million) than anyone except Warren ($25.7 million) and Sanders ($33.7 million). For comparison, Biden had only $9 million in the bank at the end of Q3. Buttigieg also boasts more field offices in Iowa than anyone else (and the same is true in New Hampshire).\n\nGiven all this, it's increasingly possible to see how Buttigieg could win the nomination. A flush, resurgent Sanders, fresh off securing the endorsement of Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and rallying 25,000 supporters in Queens, continues to split the left-wing vote with Warren. Warren continues to take incoming fire. Biden's poll numbers continue to sag, especially in the early states. And Buttigieg peaks at just the right moment, surprising everyone on caucus day with a first- or second-place finish. Biden and Sanders limp into New Hampshire, where Buttigieg repeats the feat. And suddenly, after another poor showing from Biden in South Carolina, his firewall state, it's a two-person race: Warren the progressive champion versus Buttigieg the Rust Belt pragmatist. Perhaps Sanders sticks around, siphoning votes from Warren. And state by state, Buttigieg eventually prevails.\n\nEarlier this month Buttigieg made waves with a suggestion \u2014 which he later partially retracted to avoid sounding presumptuous \u2014 that the 2020 Democratic primary contest was \"getting to be a two-way\" race between him and Warren.\n\n\"It's early to say,\" he told Showtime's \"The Circus.\" But \"a world where we're getting somewhere is a world where it's coming down to the two of us.\"\n\nThis has long been Buttigieg's plan. It won't necessarily come to fruition; he's yet to absorb the kind of frontrunner attacks that have tarnished Biden and Warren. But for now, at least, the plan seems to be working."

He was a \"top attorney\" during the GOP's investigations of Benghazi and the IRS targeting scandal. He currently serves as the panel's chief investigative counsel.\n\nCastor has been described as a \"Hidden Hand,\" the \"GOP's Get-Obama Lawyer,\" the Obama \"White House[\u2018s] Bane\" and a \"Pit-Bull Prober.\" Castor, like Goldman, conducted questioning during closed-door depositions.\n\nCastor appears to have the backing of rank-and-file Republicans, many of whom were quick to highlight his experience and institutional knowledge.\n\n\"He has the longest-running institutional knowledge of most anybody on our side of the aisle. He's been through several of these fights in the past,\" former Rep. Jason Chaffetz told the Daily Beast Tuesday.\n\nChaffetz, who previously spent three years serving as chairman of the Oversight Committee, said Republicans could be optimistic knowing Castor is leading the charge.\n\n\"From Tom Davis to Darrell Issa to me to Jim Jordan to Trey Gowdy, he's always had everybody's confidence and we are an eclectic group of oversight chairs and ranking members,\" he said, adding, \"And the fact that he's had all of our confidence is saying something,\" he said.\n\nThose sentiments were echoed by the aforementioned Issa, another former Oversight chairman Castor served under with excellent results.\n\n\"He's a very dedicated institutionalist,\" Issa said. \"He's one of those people you see on the Hill that you know he could have left a long time ago and made a lot of money in any number of places.\"\n\nAs previously reported by Law&Crime, the impeachment proceedings will not follow the normal format for public congressional hearings, which generally allow lawmakers to question witnesses in five-minute windows, alternating between members of each party. But under the resolution governing the proceedings, Castor and Goldman will each have up to 45 minutes to question and cross-examine witnesses, providing ample opportunity for the attorneys dig into the minute details that may have previously gone unnoticed."

Additionally, the memo cites several witnesses who have already testified behind closed doors that they felt there was a pressure campaign to link the aid to the inquiry.\n\nThe memo also cites two officials who testified that Ukraine was in fact aware of the hold on the aid.\n\n\"I knew from my Kurt Volker conversations and also from sort of the alarm bells that were coming from Ambassador Taylor and his team that there were Ukrainians who knew about this,\" the memo cites Laura Cooper, a top Defense official who oversees Ukraine, as testifying, referring to other officials involved in the investigation. \n\nDemocrats finally note that the military aid to Kyiv was released only after members of Congress expressed alarm over the hold.\n\nThe memo comes a day before the House is set to hold its first public hearings in its impeachment investigation. William Taylor, the top U.S. diplomat to Ukraine, and George Kent, a top State Department official, are set to testify Wednesday, while former U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch is expected to testify Friday.\n\nHouse Democrats launched their impeachment inquiry in September over concerns that Trump threatened to withhold the military funds to Zelensky unless he publicly launched an inquiry into Biden and 2016 election meddling. Republicans have dismissed concerns that Trump's request was inappropriate, arguing he was working to make sure taxpayer dollars were properly spent in a country known for corruption. \n\nHowever, several witnesses have testified that they were uncomfortable with Trump's request and that they believed there was a quid pro quo surrounding the president's dealings with Ukraine."

First, Tom Steyer jumped into the presidential race after saying he wouldn't. When pressed for a justification by Politico, he said it's because no one was prioritizing climate change. This, of course, in spite of the fact that he still has investments in oil and gas companies, not to mention an undying faith in the consumerist capitalistic system that led the planet to the point of collapse in the first place. Then, after numerous reports of Manhattan donor hand wringing, Michael Bloomberg decided to get in on the action. He is now officially on the ballot in at least a few states and his advisor Howard Wolfson says that he will skip the early primary states to focus on Super Tuesday.\n\nThe billionaire former NYC mayor would enter the primary race with a worst in field negative 31 favorability rating among Iowa voters.\n\nNext up, Deval Patrick who brings quite a record of white-washing corporate malfeasance to the table. He's got a classic up by the bootstraps story that ends with him as VP at Coca-Cola, VP at Texaco, and managing director at Bain Capital. But maybe his most revealing resume item was his time with Ameriquest, which was written about by Zach Carter over at the Huffington Post. Ameriquest was the largest subprime lender in the housing crisis. Described as the \"worst bottom feeder of them all,\" Deval Patrick sat on their board. Patrick has called Biden and others to indicate he may jump in the race. I guess the donor class loves Pete but can see the polling that has him near 0% with black voters. I personally see no reason to believe that a similar corporatist background wrapped in a different identity will achieve significantly better results\u2014 but sure, whatever.\n\nAs if that wasn't enough, now Obama A.G. Eric Holder is taking another look at the race. He's reportedly talking to strategists about a late entry. And of course, the matriarch of the Democratic establishment herself, Hillary Rodham Clinton just told the BBC that she's \"under enormous pressure from many, many, many people to think about\" running.\n\nSo why now? Why has full freakout set in over the past couple weeks? After all, as Estuardo Rodriguez pointed out on our show yesterday, he was just with Governor Patrick two weeks ago, and at that time, he was completely clear and firm in his commitment to not run. Very interesting.\n\nOf course, all of these people are claiming that they're taking another look at the race because they're just simple patriots concerned that the field isn't strong enough to defeat Trump. Here's Bloomberg's Guy Howard Wolfson again:\n\n\"We now need to finish the job and ensure that Trump is defeated, but Mike is increasingly concerned that the current field of candidates is not well positioned to do that.\"\n\nBy the way, I'm not sure I've ever seen anyone as consistently ratioed as that guy is. Anyway, don't believe the bullshit that this is all about their patriotic duty to defeat Trump. They aren't afraid Democrats will lose to Trump, they are terrified that a real progressive may actually win.\n\nAfter all, it's hard not to notice that the sudden ruling class meltdown and rush to enter the race has occurred during a time period when Bernie Sanders has seen a surge in endorsements, crowd sizes, and polling numbers. He had the best debate of his career, won the endorsement of A.O.C., Ilhan Omar, Rashida Tlaib and now the National Nurses Union. He hosted the biggest rally of the cycle in New York and just garnered the largest rally crowd in Iowa so far. That new momentum is also showing up in the polls, where he's gained 5 points in Iowa, 7 points among college students, a recent CNN poll had him leading in New Hampshire, and polls consistently show his supporters to be the most enthusiastic and the most committed. Warren and Biden, meanwhile, have both slumped during this time period and it's hard to imagine that the elite freakout is in reaction to Mayor Pete's media-fueled rise.\n\nNow the great irony of course is that nothing could be better for Bernie than a bunch of billionaire and establishment types jumping into the race to siphon off votes from his more elite-friendly rivals.\n\nBut you know, while the ruling class may be good at foreclosing on middle class homes, giving closed door speeches to Goldman Sachs, and profiting off of climate catastrophe, they're not always so great at figuring out this whole politics thing. Their ego and undying faith in their own brilliance will never allow them to see what is so patently obvious to all of us: no one outside of your tiny enclave wants you. And your candidacies will only enable and inflame the exact populist movement you are so desperate to quash. Prepare to see many more billionaire tears in the days to come."

She says it \"continues to amaze\" her that Americans partnered with \"Ukrainians who preferred to play by the old corrupt rules\" in pushing for her removal.\n\nYovanovitch is also sounding alarm that senior State Department officials did not defend her from attacks from the president's allies, including former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani.

It consists largely of pleasantries and words of congratulations.\n\nThe White House made a record of the conversation public at the start of the House impeachment hearing on Friday.\n\nRep. Devin Nunes, the top Republican on the House Intelligence Committee, read the document aloud to suggest that there was nothing untoward in the conversation.\n\nRep. Adam Schiff, the committee chairman, said Trump should also \"release the thousands of other records that he has instructed the State Department not to release.\"\n\n___\n\n9:30 a.m.\n\nHouse Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff says former Ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch was \"smeared and cast aside\" by President Donald Trump because she was considered an obstacle to his personal and political agenda.\n\nOpening the second public House impeachment hearing, Schiff said the question isn't whether Trump could recall Yovanovitch but \"why would he want to?\"\n\nYovanovitch testified behind closed doors last month that she was told to \"watch her back\" before she was ousted in May as Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani led a shadow foreign policy.\n\nSchiff said pushback at the State Department failed when it became clear that Trump wanted her gone.\n\nRepublican Rep.

She has served both Democratic and Republican presidents.\n\nThe rare impeachment inquiry is focused on Trump's actions toward Ukraine. Democrats say it amounts to bribery, as the president withheld military aid to Ukraine while he pushed the country to investigate rival Democrats, including Joe Biden.\n\nTrump calls the probe a hoax and says he did nothing wrong.\n\n__\n\n12:15 a.m.\n\nThe House will hear from a singular witness Friday in the Trump impeachment hearings: Marie Yovanovitch, the former U.S. ambassador to Ukraine who was targeted by the president's allies in a \"smear\" campaign now central to the probe.\n\nThe career diplomat, who served both Republican and Democratic presidents, is expected to relay her striking story of being suddenly recalled by Donald Trump and told to \"watch my back.\" It was all part of a swiftly developing series of events that sounded alarms about the White House's shadow foreign policy.\n\nFriday is the second day of public hearings to consider removing America's 45th president. Democrats and Republicans are hardening their messages to voters as they try to sway voter opinion amid a deeply polarized public.\n\nThe House will hear from a singular witness Friday in the Trump impeachment hearings: Marie Yovanovitch, the former U.S. ambassador to Ukraine who was targeted by the president's allies in a \"smear\" campaign now central to the inquiry."

Col. Alexander Vindman, director of European Affairs at the National Security Council \u2013 also testified that they were so alarmed by the quid pro quos being put to Kyiv that they reported their concerns directly to National Security Council Legal Adviser John Eisenberg.\n\nBoth Mulvaney and Eisenberg have declined to testify, despite having received subpoenas from Congress.\n\nAt the center of the ongoing House impeachment inquiry is an effort by Trump and his personal attorney Rudy Giuliani to get Ukraine to launch an investigation that would have included his 2020 political rival, Joe Biden.\n\nGordon Sondland, a Trump-appointed ambassador, has testified that he relayed the message to Ukraine that nearly $400 million in military aid was tied to its willingness to announce the probe.\n\nAccording to the latest transcripts, Sondland said he had Mulvaney's blessing, which Sondland expressed in a July 10 meeting with Ukrainian officials in which national security adviser John Bolton tried to abruptly cut short.\n\n\"Ambassador Sondland blurted out: \u2018Well, we have an agreement with the chief of staff for a meeting if these investigations in the energy sector start,\" Hill said.\n\nVindman confirmed her account, saying Sondland said the requirement of an investigation that included the Bidens \"had been coordinated with White House Chief of Staff Mr. Mick Mulvaney.\"\n\nVindman also said he thought it was \"inappropriate\" to call for an investigation by a foreign power into a U.S. citizen.\n\n\"The request to investigate the Bidens and his son had nothing to do with national security, and that such investigations were not something that the NSC was going to get involved in or push,\" Vindman said.\n\nThe testimony also raises serious questions about Eisenberg's handling of the complaints and whether he tried to act on them.\n\nVindman says he approached Eisenberg two weeks before Trump's phone call in which he repeatedly urged the president of Ukraine to investigate his political rivals, warning him of the demands being made.\n\n\"I vaguely recall something about: \u2018I'll take a look into it. You know there might not be anything there. We'll take a look into it,' something of that nature\" said Vindman, describing his conversation with Eisenberg, on July 10.\n\nVindman said he went back to Eisenberg again within an hour after Trump's July 25 phone call to Ukraine's president because he believed it amounted to a \"demand\" by Trump that a foreign power investigate a U.S. citizen, in this case Biden.\n\nHe also testified that he thought Eisenberg made the decision to put a transcript of Trump's July 25 call into a system intended to restrict distribution.\n\nWhen asked why distribution would be limited, Vindman said because it \"would implicate a partisan play\" that could damage U.S.-Ukrainian relations.\n\nHill said she was so alarmed by the July 10 meeting with top Ukrainian officials that she reported her concerns to then-National Security Adviser John Bolton who demanded she relay the details to Eisenberg, which she testified she did.\n\nHill said Bolton told her: \"You go and tell Eisenberg that I am not part of whatever drug deal Sondland and Mulvaney are cooking up on this, and you go and tell him what you've heard and what I've said.\""

        "text": "A former public defender is entering the race to be Los Angeles County district attorney, bringing a contrasting perspective to a field otherwise filled by career prosecutors and law enforcement officials.\n\nRachel Rossi announced her candidacy to unseat Dist. Atty. Jackie Lacey on Tuesday afternoon, becoming the latest in a wave of self-professed reform candidates to challenge for D.A. posts in major cities in recent years.\n\n\"The prosecutor really is the key toward change and reform and focusing our policies in a direction of safety and smart efforts rather than blanket incarceration of people on all levels of offenses in a way that wastes taxpayer dollars and doesn't promote public safety,\" Rossi said in an interview with The Times.\n\nRossi, 37, joins former San Francisco Dist. Atty. George Gascon and L.A. County Deputy Dist. Attys. Richard Ceballos and Joseph Iniguez in the push to unseat Lacey. The deadline for candidates to file for the March 2020 primary is Dec. 6.\n\nSimilar to Lacey's other challengers, Rossi appears intent on running a campaign promising reforms in the D.A.'s office. But she is the only contender in the field who does not come from a police or prosecutorial background, which Rossi believes gives her an edge over some of her more veteran opponents.\n\nIn recent years, public defenders have proved to be a force in district attorney's races throughout the nation. Chesa Boudin, a former San Francisco public defender, claimed victory in the race to replace Gascon earlier this month, and former federal public defender Larry Krasner won a 2017 election in Philadelphia seen as one of the biggest victories in a national push to elect more progressive prosecutors.\n\nRossi, who grew up in the Inland Empire, served as a state and federal public defender in Los Angeles County from 2011 to 2017, then went to work for U.S. Sen. Richard Durbin (D-Ill.) in his role on the Senate Judiciary Committee. In that job, Rossi helped draft the First Step Act, a bipartisan federal prison reform bill that reduced some mandatory minimum sentences and opened pathways to early release for lower-risk inmates.\n\nRossi said she had always planned to return to Los Angeles after her stint in Washington and believes the race here provides a chance to redefine the role of elected prosecutors, which she believes is often misinterpreted.\n\n\"The role of a prosecutor historically has been to seek justice, not to seek incarceration and convictions. I think we've got that wrong; we've interpreted that as winning cases, racking up convictions, racking up years in jail,\" she said. \"People are starting to see, not only that it's inhumane, not only that we're the incarceration capital of the world, but that it doesn't work. It doesn't keep us safe.\"\n\nRossi said that if elected she would strengthen diversionary programs to keep low-level offenders out of the criminal justice system. She also wants to revise the office's handling of cases involving mentally ill defendants.\n\nWhile Lacey often touts her office's diversionary program as evidence of her progressive bona fides, Rossi echoed concerns \u2014 often raised by defense attorneys \u2014 that access to the program is extremely limited.\n\n\"There should be medical input on who can be helped by diversion,\" she said. \"I think there are certain situations where someone has committed a crime and incarceration isn't the right option, but some other kind of treatment is.\"\n\nRossi also said she believes district attorney's offices should be granted the power to appoint special prosecutors to review police shootings and other use-of-force cases. Critics say Lacey is reticent to charge officers involved in controversial shootings, and the issue is certain to become central to the 2020 race.\n\nLacey says her office is simply working within the law, which provides wide latitude to law enforcement officers when using deadly force. She has also sought to brand herself as a progressive in recent months, pushing to expunge low-level marijuana convictions after Californians voted to allow recreational cannabis use. Some observers have noted the shift came only after Gascon enacted a similar policy in 2018.\n\nRossi's campaign will be run by Paula Ramirez, who served as L.A. County Sheriff Alex Villanueva's campaign manager and helped shape his upset win in 2018 against incumbent Jim McDonnell.\n\nJohn Hanusz, a former federal public defender who worked alongside Rossi in Los Angeles, said he believes her background on the defense side of the aisle will bring critical issues to the forefront of a race dominated by prosecutors and former police officers.\n\n\"She will be a formidable adversary in this race just as she is in court and I think she's got a bird's-eye view of the criminal justice system, both as a practitioner and as a policy person in D.C.,\" he said. \"She knows the human and financial costs of mass incarceration and will bring those issues to the fore in this race.\""

The highest level was in 2016, when nearly $12 million in total political spending occurred at Trump businesses that year.\n\nDemocrats and critics of the administration have long argued that the president's financial arrangements, namely his decision to not sell his businesses before taking office, violate the constitution's Emoluments Clause prohibiting gifts to members of the federal government.\n\n\"President Trump has perfected the financial shakedown of seeking political influence as a way of life,\"  Rep.

        "text": "The Supreme Court on Thursday delivered a blow to President Trump's immigration agenda, ruling the administration's attempt to dismantle an Obama-era program that protects young undocumented immigrants from deportation was unlawful.\n\nWith its 5-4 ruling, the high court provided a lifeline to nearly 700,000 immigrants whose future in the United States hung in the balance while a yearslong legal battle over the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program moved through the courts.\n\nChief Justice John Roberts, who joined the four liberals justices on the bench, delivered the opinion for the court, writing that the Trump administration's decision to unwind the program was \"arbitrary and capricious\" under the Administrative Procedure Act.\n\nRoberts wrote the court does \"not decide whether DACA or its rescission are sound policies,\" but said the Department of Homeland Security should revisit the issue. \n\n\"We address only whether the agency complied with the procedural requirement that it provide a reasoned explanation for its action. Here the agency failed to consider the conspicuous issues of whether to retain forbearance and what if anything to do about the hardship to DACA recipients,\" he wrote for the majority. \"That dual failure raises doubts about whether the agency appreciated the scope of its discretion or exercised that discretion in a reasonable manner.\"\n\nMr. Trump chided the Supreme Court's decision in the DACA case, as well as a ruling earlier this week that expanded federal workplace protections to LGBTQ people, tweeting \"Do you get the impression that the Supreme Court doesn't like me?\"\n\n\"These horrible & politically charged decisions coming out of the Supreme Court are shotgun blasts into the face of people that are proud to call themselves Republicans or Conservatives. We need more Justices or we will lose our 2nd. Amendment & everything else. Vote Trump 2020!\" the president said in another tweet.\n\nMr. Trump said Thursday's decision was \"a highly political one, and seemingly not based on the law,\" and claimed it \"gives the President of the United States far more power than EVER anticipated.\"\n\n\"As President of the United States, I am asking for a legal solution on DACA, not a political one, consistent with the rule of law. The Supreme Court is not willing to give us one, so now we have to start this process all over again,\" he tweeted.\n\nThe acting head of the Department of Homeland Security, which oversees the program, said the court's decision deprives DACA recipients of \"closure and finality surrounding their status here in the U.S.\"\n\n\"The DACA program was created out of thin air and implemented illegally,\" Acting Secretary Chad Wolf said in a statement. \"The American people deserve to have the Nation's laws faithfully executed as written by their representatives in Congress-not based on the arbitrary decisions of a past Administration. This ruling usurps the clear authority of the Executive Branch to end unlawful programs.\"\n\nThe decision from the high court comes against the backdrop of the coronavirus pandemic, during which thousands of \"Dreamers\" covered by the program who work in the medical field found themselves on the front lines of the public health crisis that has taken the lives of more than 117,000 people in the U.S.\n\nIn March, lawyers representing Dreamers asked the justices to take the pandemic into account when deciding whether to bless the Trump administration's decision to unwind DACA. They estimated roughly 27,000 DACA recipients are healthcare workers, while another 200 are medical students.\n\n\"DACA recipients are essential to protecting communities across the country endangered by COVID-19,\" the lawyers told the Supreme Court. \"Termination of DACA during this national emergency would be catastrophic.\"\n\nIt has been nearly three years since the Trump administration announced it would be rescinding DACA, a program that was created by the Obama administration in 2012 and extends legal protections for young immigrants brought to the U.S. illegally as children. At the time, in September 2017, the Trump administration provided Congress with a five-month window to codify DACA's legal protections. But lawmakers failed to reach consensus on a broader immigration reform package that would address the fate of Dreamers.\n\nIn justifying its decision, the Trump administration cited a 2015 ruling from the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in a challenge to a similar program implemented by President Barack Obama, known as Deferred Action for Parents of Americans. The lower court ruled that program was unlawful, and an equally divided Supreme Court affirmed the 5th Circuit's decision with a 4-4 ruling in the summer of 2016.\n\nBut states, civil rights groups and Dreamers argued the Trump administration failed to provide an adequate explanation for its decision to end the program, violating federal law, and rested its repeal of DACA on the faulty premise that the program is unlawful.\n\nLower courts in the District of Columbia, California and New York have sided with the coalition challenging the administration's roll back in various legal battles and have ordered the Trump administration to keep DACA intact.\n\nThe Supreme Court agreed in June 2019 to take up the legal fight over DACA and held arguments in November, during which the conservative justices seemed ready to side with the Trump administration.\n\nJustice Clarence Thomas, joined by Justices Samuel Alito and Neil Gorsuch, wrote in a dissent that the court's decision was \"mystifying\" and said the majority \"acts as though it is engaging in the routine application of standard principles of administrative law.\"\n\n\"Today's decision must be recognized for what it is: an effort to avoid a politically controversial but legally correct decision,\" Thomas wrote. \"The court could have made clear that the solution respondents seek must come from the legislative branch. Instead, the majority has decided to prolong DHS' initial overreach by providing a stopgap measure of its own. In doing so, it has given the green light for future political battles to be fought in this court rather than where they rightfully belong \u2014 the political branches.\"\n\nThomas wrote the decision in rebuffing the Trump administration's efforts to unwind DACA \"creates perverse incentives, particularly for outgoing administrations.\"\n\nMr. Trump made immigration a cornerstone of his 2016 presidential campaign and vowed to \"immediately terminate\" DACA if he were elected president. In addition to following through on his pledge to unwind the Obama-era program, Mr. Trump has also overseen a crackdown on illegal and legal immigration and imposed restrictions on asylum-seekers arriving at the southern border.\n\nWhile he has defended his efforts to end the program, the president has also acknowledged the sweeping impact its rescission would have on hundreds of thousands of Dreamers. In October, Mr. Trump said on Twitter that if the Supreme Court were to allow his administration to end DACA, Republicans and Democrats would reach a deal to allow Dreamers to remain in the U.S. \"in very short order.\"\n\nBut legislative action has slowed to a crawl since the coronavirus began to rapidly spread across the U.S. in March, as Congress shifted its focus to responding to the crisis."

Protesters also dressed in red capes similar to the ones in Margaret Atwood's novel \"The Handmaid's Tale\".\n\nKavanaugh was a speaker at the annual Federalist Society convention black-tie dinner.

        "text": "Bernie Sanders rallied hundreds of supporters outside the New Hampshire capital when the senator formally filed to compete in the state's first-in-the-nation presidential primary. A howling crowd cheered South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg as he walked through the statehouse to file his paperwork.\n\nWhen it was Colorado Sen. Michael Bennet's turn, he wound up with about a dozen supporters and a pep talk from Secretary of State Bill Gardner, the dean of the New Hampshire primary.\n\n\"Giving the little guy a chance, that's what it's about,\" Gardner assured Bennet, who sits at about 1% in most polls.\n\nVoters cast ballots in less than three months, and the Democratic primary is still crowded with little guys. Roughly a half-dozen candidates in the very bottom tier of the Democratic presidential primary are soldiering on, hoping that even after months of campaigning without catching fire that there's still a chance. Their resolve reflects, in part, some Democrats' insistence that the lineup of top contenders is deeply flawed and the race is primed for some late twists and turns.\n\n\"I truly believe that that person is as likely to be someone polling at 1% today as it is to be the people that are leading in the race today,\" Bennet told reporters after filing his paperwork. \"Stranger things have happened than that.\"\n\nCandidates like Bennet have some reason for optimism. Polls show many Democratic voters, even in early-voting states, have not made up their minds. In Iowa, the first state to weigh in, the front of the pack is crowded, another sign of ambiguity, some argue. Worries about the strength of the front-runners prompted Michael Bloomberg, the billionaire former New York mayor, to move toward a bid, threatening to expand the field just as the party thought it would be winnowing.\n\nSome higher-profile aspirants, including New York Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand or former Texas Rep. Beto O'Rourke, weren't able to stick it out, after months of poor polling and lackluster fundraising. Some middle-tier candidates, meanwhile, have had to scale back their operations. California Sen. Kamala Harris pulled staff from New Hampshire this past week, while former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Julian Castro cut positions there and in early-voting South Carolina.\n\nBut Bennet and others seemed to have prepared for a long, very slow burn. Bennet and Montana Gov. Steve Bullock never expected to raise much money and built small-scale operations that could carry them until the first part of February, when Iowa and then New Hampshire vote.\n\n\"Everybody goes up and down, and what I need to be is organizing and catching fire as voting starts,\" said Bullock, another candidate mired in the bottom tier who has announced an initial $500,000 advertising campaign in Iowa.\n\nBennet and Bullock stand out in the crowded bottom tier as two well-regarded moderate politicians who got into the race late \u2014 in May \u2014 and appear to have the same strategy: wait for former Vice President Joe Biden's support to collapse and hope they're the best centrist standing. A Bloomberg bid would immediately add another contender \u2014 and millions of dollars \u2014 to the competition on that front, though the former mayor's team says he will likely stay out of early states.\n\nOther perennial 1% polling candidates have plans that are far less clear. They include spiritualist and best-selling author Marianne Williamson, who moved from Los Angeles to Iowa for the race; former Pennsylvania Rep. Joe Sestak, who just concluded a walk across New Hampshire to attempt to draw attention to his campaign; and former Maryland Rep. John Delaney, a wealthy businessman who is self-funding much of his race.\n\nDelaney explained his continued campaign with a \"why not?\" rationale. After millions spent and countless hours of time, \"it just seems kind of crazy for me to get out before the caucus,\" he said.\n\nLooking for hope, Bennet has clung to the example of Gary Hart, a U.S. senator from Colorado who was considered a longshot White House hopeful in 1984 when he stunned the political world by winning New Hampshire. Hart, whose picture is on the wall of Gardner's office, has endorsed Bennet and recently wrote an opinion piece for USA Today urging people not to write off his younger protege.\n\nHart, however, was not shut out of most of the primary debates, as Bennet and Bullock have been this year. The Democratic National Committee's increasingly rigorous polling and fundraising criteria are a new attempt to shrink a historically large field. And Hart, in the end, found there were limits to what an underdog can achieve in a presidential primary. He ultimately lost his bid for the nomination to Walter Mondale, the party's former vice president and heir apparent. (Hart's 1988 campaign for the nomination was undone by a sex scandal.)\n\nStill, Bennet's team notes that there has been no dominating political presence in their party's primary, like Mondale or Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton were in 2008.\n\n\"This is the most unsettled field ever,\" said Craig Hughes, a top Bennet strategist. \"The dynamics are unlike anything we've ever seen.\"\n\nHughes proudly noted the one sign of movement in the race: The Bennet campaign is shopping for new office space as it expands in New Hampshire. One of the spots it toured last week had just been vacated by the formerly top-tier Harris campaign."

        "title": "Hunter Biden could be collateral damage as Trump impeachment hearings begin",
        "text": "The Trump impeachment hearings set to launch in full public view this week will give Democrats the chance to make the case for why President Trump should face the prospect of removal from office \u2014 but the reputation of Hunter Biden, whose dealings in Ukraine touched off the chain of events leading to this point, could also take a beating by the time the hearings are through.\n\nRepublicans signaled their intent to focus on the younger Biden when they sought him as a hearing witness in a letter sent over the weekend. Democrats are unlikely to approve the request, but his conduct may be an unavoidable topic in this week's hearings, given that witnesses' closed-door testimony to date has made clear some in the prior administration held concerns about his role on the board of Ukrainian natural gas firm Burisma Holdings.\n\nEven without Hunter Biden in the hearing room, Republicans will be eager to publicly pry into those concerns, if only to offer justification for the act at the heart of the impeachment inquiry: Trump's request for Ukraine to investigate Hunter Biden's role, as well as former Vice President Joe Biden's connection to the firing of a prosecutor looking into the firm's founder.\n\n\"I think this is absolutely worth looking into,\" Republican Rep. Michael Waltz, of Florida, said Sunday on Fox News' \"America's News HQ,\" regarding the Hunter Biden controversy. \"Yet the mainstream media and the Democrats just want to say 'nothing to see here'.\"\n\nHouse impeachment inquiry moves to public phaseVideo\nOne of the first impeachment witnesses, State Department official George Kent, could be pressed by Republicans about Hunter Biden's work. He is one of two witnesses scheduled for the first day of public hearings Wednesday.\n\nRepublicans are likely to zero in on his prior closed-door testimony, where he discussed his concerns about Biden's work with Burisma, but said he was told it wasn't appropriate to discuss the matter because of the health struggles of former Vice President Joe Biden's eldest son, Beau, who died of brain cancer.\n\nAccording to a transcript of his Oct. 15 deposition released last week, Kent said that in January or February 2015, he \"became aware that Hunter Biden was on the board\" of Burisma Holdings while his father was overseeing Ukraine policy as vice president to former President Barack Obama.\n\n\"I did not know that at the time,\" Kent testified. \"And when I was on a call with somebody on the vice president's staff and I cannot recall who it was, just briefing on what was happening into Ukraine, I raised my concerns that I had heard that Hunter Biden was on the board of a company owned by somebody that the U.S. government had spent money trying to get tens of millions of dollars back, and that could create the perception of a conflict of interest.\"\n\nAfter discussing those concerns with Biden's staff, Kent testified that \"the message that I recall hearing back was that the vice president's son Beau was dying of cancer and that there was no further bandwidth to deal with family-related issues at that time.\"\n\nKent also told congressional investigators that he had repeatedly raised concerns with the Obama administration about Burisma, and also discussed the administration's efforts to remove Ukrainian prosecutor Viktor Shokin from his post. At the time, Shokin was investigating Mykola Zlochevsky, the former minister of ecology and natural resources of Ukraine\u2014 also the founder of Burisma.\n\nShokin was fired in April 2016, and his case was closed by the prosecutor who replaced him, Yuriy Lutsenko (though Ukraine is now reviewing such cases). Biden once famously boasted on camera that when he was vice president and leading the Obama administration's Ukraine policy, he successfully pressured Ukraine to fire Shokin.\n\nBiden allies, though, maintain that his intervention had nothing to do with his son, but rather was tied to corruption concerns.\n\nHouse investigators release George Kent's closed-door impeachment inquiry testimonyVideo\nShokin was widely accused of corruption on both sides of the Atlantic. Biden has said that the international community was supportive in pushing for his firing. The former vice president has repeatedly defended himself and his son, saying that neither of them did anything wrong when it came to work in Ukraine.\n\n\"My son did nothing wrong. I did nothing wrong,\" Biden said during a Democratic primary debate in October. \"I carried out the policy of the United States government, which was to root out corruption in Ukraine and that's what we should be focusing on.\"\n\nHe added: \"Rudy Giuliani, the president and his thugs have already proven they are flat-out lying.\"\n\nHunter Biden has also defended his role, saying he did nothing improper, while acknowledging that it was \"poor judgment\" to have joined Burisma's board.\n\n\"I know I did nothing wrong at all. Was it poor judgment to be in the middle of something that is a swamp in many ways? Yeah,\" the younger Biden said last month.\n\nThe Biden family actions in Ukraine, along with a separate issue connected to 2016 election interference, were at the core of what Trump wanted investigated out of Kiev. Trump's now-famous July phone call in which he pressured Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to launch the investigations prompted a whistleblower complaint and, in turn, the impeachment inquiry in the House. The president's request came after millions in U.S. military aid to Ukraine had been frozen, which Democrats and some witnesses have cited as a quid pro quo arrangement.\n\nSTATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL TOLD CONGRESS HE RAISED CONCERNS ABOUT HUNTER BIDEN'S UKRAINE DEALINGS IN 2015 BUT WAS IGNORED\n\nThe whistleblower's complaint also stated their concerns that Trump was soliciting a foreign power to influence the 2020 presidential election \u2014 a concern that U.S. diplomat Bill Taylor directly testified to last month.\n\nHouse investigators release transcript of Amb. Bill Taylor's impeachment testimonyVideo\nTaylor, during his closed-door deposition, testified that he \"understood that the reason for investigating Burisma was to cast Vice President Biden in a bad light.\" Taylor added that it would benefit \"a political campaign for the reelection of President Trump.\"\n\nTaylor is expected to testify with Kent on Wednesday as part of the first round of public hearings in the impeachment inquiry.\n\nMeanwhile, in a letter penned by Rep. Devin Nunes, R-Calif., Republicans have also proposed Hunter Biden's former longtime business partner, Devon Archer, as a witness, claiming he could help to understand \"the nature and extent of Ukraine's pervasive corruption\" which could provide \"information that bears directly on President Trump's longstanding and deeply-held skepticism of the country.\"\n\nBut according to formal rules for the impeachment inquiry passed last month, Democrats have final say over witnesses.\n\nEven outside the impeachment inquiry process, GOP lawmakers are amplifying concerns over the younger Biden's business dealings. Last week, Senate Homeland Security and Government Affairs Committee Chairman Ron Johnson, R-Wis., and Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, penned a letter to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, taking issue with Biden and Archer's roles on the board of Burisma.\n\n\"Emails recently obtained and made public through a FOIA request indicate that Burisma's consulting firm used Hunter Biden's role on Burisma's board to gain access and potentially influence matters at the State Department,\" they wrote, further requesting State Department information related to Biden and Archer's work.\n\nThey cited a 2016 email, first reported by Fox News contributor John Solomon, from a State Department official describing a request for a meeting from a Burisma representative -- the request name-dropped Hunter Biden.\n\n\"She noted that two high-profile U.S. citizens are affiliated with the company (including Hunter Biden as a board member),\" the email said, saying the representative wanted to get \"a better understanding of how the U.S. came to the determination that the company is corrupt\" while arguing there was no evidence of corruption.\n\nMeanwhile, on Friday former ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovich is expected to testify before the House Intelligence Committee in public. Yovanovich has previously told congressional investigators as part of the probe that former Vice President Biden never \"raised the issue of either Burisma or Hunter Biden\" with her."

        "text": "It didn't take long at Friday's impeachment hearing before Rep. Elise Stefanik, the House Intelligence Committee's only Republican woman, was gaveled down by the panel's Democratic chairman.\n\nRepublicans kept the 35-year-old Harvard graduate from upstate New York in the spotlight all day. Among other things, they gave her a prominent slot to question the day's witness, former U.S. ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch, even though Stefanik ranks only seventh among the committee's nine Republicans.\n\n\"We know clearly you're going to interrupt us throughout this hearing,\" Stefanik complained within minutes of Friday's opening gavel.\n\nThough she was breaking committee rules with her interruptions, the outburst gave Republicans a nationally televised opening to accuse Trump nemesis and committee Chairman Adam Schiff, D-Calif., of treating a woman lawmaker unfairly.\n\n\"You are gagging the young lady from New York,\" said the panel's top Republican, California Rep. Devin Nunes.\n\nIt was no accident that the GOP featured Stefanik \u2014 who looks even younger than her age and is one of only 13 Republican women in the entire House \u2014 so prominently.\n\nA member of the Intelligence and Armed Services committees, Stefanik's visibility in the House has slowly grown as she gets her footing on issues and at home in her upstate New York district. Lacking a deep bench of rising female members of Congress, Republicans said it was smart to give her a conspicuous role Friday.\n\n\"She's effective. She's a great spokesperson,\" said Rep. John Ratcliffe, R-Texas, another member of the Intelligence committee. \"And these issues are in her wheelhouse.\"\n\nBut on the second day of Democratic-driven hearings into whether President Donald Trump should be impeached, there was more to Stefanik's prominence than that.\n\nYovanovitch had become emotional when she was interviewed behind closed doors last month during the initial phase of the impeachment inquiry. There were worries that Democrats would try eliciting that reaction from Yovanovitch during Friday's nationally televised hearing, and giving a woman a leading role would help soften that, said one Republican who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss planning.\n\nDemocrats said showcasing Stefanik was a strategic move by Republicans.\n\nRep. Val Demings, D-Fla., said that with the committee questioning \"a female witness who is a career foreign service officer with an impeccable record, and they want to badger her, it's a better look when a woman has taken the lead on that.\"\n\nElected to Congress in 2014, Stefanik is no political novice.\n\nDaughter of parents who ran a plywood business, she worked in the White House under President George W. Bush. She was a campaign aide to Rep. Paul Ryan, R-Wis., when he was his party's unsuccessful vice presidential candidate in 2012.\n\nShe's been one of the more moderate House Republicans, befitting a lawmaker whose district voted for Barack Obama in 2008 and 2012 before shifting to Trump in 2016.\n\nShe's broken from Trump on issues including his efforts to unilaterally use money to build a border wall with Mexico and withdrawing the U.S. from the Paris agreement on climate change.\n\n\"She's been working hard,\" said Rep. Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, a fiery Trump supporter. \"We knew before this even started that she'd be outstanding.\"\n\nStefanik was 30 when first elected, the youngest woman ever elected to the House. She's since been supplanted by Democratic Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, a fellow New Yorker elected last year at age 29.\n\nStefanik has also solidified her hold on a huge district that hugs the Canadian border and that Trump won by 11 percentage points in 2016. She was not included on Democrats' early list of GOP-held districts they are targeting next year.\n\nStefanik kept a low profile during the Intelligence panel's year-long investigation into Russia's help to Trump's 2016 campaign.\n\nBut as this fall's Ukraine inquiry heated up, she tweeted a criticism of Schiff for parodying Trump as a mob boss shaking someone down. Trump seized on that narrative, saying Schiff had made up a conversation.\n\nBy last year, she'd vaulted to a prominent job recruiting women candidates for the House Republican campaign committee.\n\nBut after only one of more than 100 female Republican candidates won last November, Stefanik's feisty side went on display.\n\nShe left her campaign committee post and said she'd lead her own effort to find stronger women candidates. When she was criticized by a leading Republican, a male, she tweeted, \"NEWSFLASH I wasn't asking for permission.\"\n\nStefanik didn't shy away from Friday's spotlight, either.\n\nShe queried Yovanovitch cordially, including questions about former Vice President Joe Biden's son, Hunter, and his job advising a Ukrainian energy company. Trump has suggested without evidence that the arrangement involved improprieties.\n\nAnd when the day's testy five-hour hearing ended, Stefanik stood in the front ranks of GOP lawmakers facing television cameras.\n\nShe complained that Schiff had unfairly \"muzzled\" her and other Republicans from asking questions. In fact, each side's lawmakers had received equal time to query Yovanovitch.\n\nBut Stefanik was also forced to defend a Trump tweet that many Republicans saw as a distracting public relations blunder.\n\nAs Yovanovitch testified, Trump tweeted that every country where she'd ever served as an envoy had \"turned bad.\" Democrats accused him of witness intimidation.\n\n\"We're not here to talk about tweets. We're here to talk about impeachable offenses,\u2033 Stefanik told reporters.\n\nCapitalizing on Stefanik's role, Republicans and conservatives filled Twitter with raves about her performance, with one dubbing her, \"Total rockstar.\"\n\nBut her Democratic opponent in next November's election, Tedra Cobb, used Stefanik's appearance to raise campaign funds, tweeting that \"partisan political theatre is beneath the dignity of her office.\""

        "text": "When Brazil's far-right President Jair Bolsonaro traveled to New York for the United Nations General Assembly in September, he was recovering from surgery and reportedly left after 30 hours without having met with any heads of state.\n\nDespite the brevity of his trip, Bolsonaro did make time to meet with someone who occupies a special position within President Donald Trump's inner circle \u2013 Rudy Giuliani.\n\nThe meeting, which involved a discussion of security and Brazil's prison system, according to a tweet by Bolsonaro's son who also attended, was just one in a series of interactions Giuliani has had with foreign leaders since he began representing Trump as his personal attorney last year.\n\nGiuliani has met or communicated with senior government officials from at least seven foreign countries since he became Trump's pro-bono personal lawyer in April 2018, according to a CNN review. He has also given paid speeches on behalf of an Iranian dissident group and met with a politician from the Dominican Republic.\n\nWhile Giuliani has long dealt with foreign governments through the self-titled consulting firm he founded in 2002 after serving as New York's mayor, his more recent status as an attorney for the President has enabled him to interact with foreign leaders outside of official diplomatic channels while being treated like a US emissary.\n\nTwo current and two former State Department staffers told CNN that Giuliani's communication with foreign leaders has complicated, and at times undercut, official US foreign policy.\n\nA current State Department staffer who spoke to CNN said US officials track some of Giuliani's comments because they carry the risk of confusing foreign entities and complicating messaging.\n\n\"When someone with that level of profile speaks on highly sensitive issues in a way that doesn't align with US policy, that is noted with concern,\" said the staffer, who spoke on the condition of anonymity due to the sensitivity of the issue.\n\nAndrew Miller, a former official who worked in the State Department during the Bush and Obama administrations and served on the National Security Council during the Obama era said, \"There are those in the State Department and the professional U.S. national security apparatus who view Giuliani as a shadow secretary of state.\"\n\nIn most of Giuliani's foreign interactions, he has pursued private business interests, but his association with Trump is often highlighted by state-run media and groups he meets with.\n\nDuring a business trip to Bahrain in December 2018 in which Giuliani had a rare meeting with the country's leader, King Hamad bin Isa Al Khalifa, the state-run Bahrain News Agency described Giuliani as a \"high-level US delegation.\"\n\nGiuliani also met with Bahrain's crown prince and government ministers and discussed \"the long-standing partnership between Bahrain and the U.S.,\" according to a statement on the prince's official website, which also referred to Giuliani as the leader of a US delegation.\n\nGiuliani said at the time he traveled to Bahrain for talks related to his company Giuliani Security & Safety and the kingdom's security operation. Several months after his trip Giuliani confirmed that GSS had secured a contract to help train the kingdom's police force, which has received international criticism for its repression of protestors, especially in the wake of the 2011 Arab Spring. Giuliani has a previous tie to Bahrain. His former law firm Bracewell Giuliani worked on financial deals for the nation.\n\nGiuliani's 2018 trip was arranged by the lobbying firm Sonoran Policy Group, which was paid by the Bahraini government to \"facilitate meetings and interactions with U.S. administration officials,\" according to foreign lobbying. As a private attorney, Giuliani is not an official member of the President's administration.\n\nSonoran also hosted an event at The Hay-Adams hotel in Washington, DC, where Giuliani met with officials from the Democratic Republic of Congo and discussed a possible consulting arrangement in July 2018, according to a source familiar with the meeting. The New York Times first reported details of Giuliani's attendance at the event.\n\nThat event, the \"Opportunity Africa Summit,\" sought to highlight \"the strategic relationship between the U.S. and Africa,\" according to foreign lobbying disclosures.\n\nCNN previously reported that criminal prosecutors and FBI counterintelligence agents have been looking into Giuliani's business dealings in Ukraine.\n\nGiuliani's efforts in that country have become a recurring theme in testimony given to House impeachment investigators examining allegations that Trump sought Ukrainian help to boost his reelection chances. Bill Taylor, the top US diplomat in Ukraine, said in closed-door testimony last month that Giuliani pressed Ukraine to \"intervene in US domestic policy or politics\" by opening investigations into Trump's political rivals. Giuliani has said he was solely acting \"as a defense attorney to defend my client against false charges, that kept changing as one after another were disproven.\"\n\nGiuliani's interactions with world leaders \u2013 like his visit to Uruguay last November \u2013 can be challenging for the State Department, because he does not work for the US government and does not have an obligation to report the contents of his conversations through official channels, according to Miller.\n\n\"It is dangerous because it creates the possibility that foreign countries can play various actors within the US off against each other,\" he said.\n\n\"When you have someone whose interests are not aligned with the US government who is prioritizing his private financial interests, that\u2026 makes it a possibility that there's going to be some compromising of US national security,\" Miller added.\n\nGiuliani rejected the notion that he has enriched himself abroad through his associations with the President and said everything he has done is legal.\n\n\"I am in private law practice. I practice law honorably and well, never had a complaint. Never had an issue ever in 50 years of private law practice,\" Giuliani told CNN.\n\nGiuliani has at times strayed from US policy in his statements during foreign dealings.\n\nIn June 2018, the US and 11 other nations issued a statement urging the government of Romania to continue its crackdown on corruption.\n\nLess than two months later, Giuliani wrote a letter to Romania's President and criticized the country's National Anticorruption Directorate, which he said had \"severely undermined\" rule of law in the country. He called for \"amnesty\u2026 to those who have been prosecuted and convicted\" by the unit.\n\nAfter Giuliani wrote his letter to Romania, he told The Guardian he was acting as a contractor for the private firm of former FBI director Louis Freeh, who had been retained to review the case of a Romanian businessman convicted in a land-fraud scheme.\n\nFormer Vice President Joe Biden's son, Hunter, was previously retained by the same Romanian businessman but then referred the case to Freeh's firm, according to a source with knowledge. NBC first reported Hunter Biden's role in the case.\n\nWhen Giuliani visited Armenia, where the nation's acting defense minister gave him a private briefing in October 2018, a reporter asked, \"Mr. Giuliani as an adviser\u2026 should [the] Trump administration recognize the Armenian genocide?\"\n\nThe US government does not formally recognize the mass killings of Armenians in the Ottoman Empire as genocide, but Giuliani responded, \"I certainly recognize it and think it's a historical fact, but I'm not here in my capacity as a private lawyer for President Trump. I'm here as a private citizen.\"\n\nDespite Giuliani's insistence on not representing the US government, the conference where he gave a speech referred to him in a schedule as \"Advisor to the President of the United States on Cybersecurity,\" which was Giuliani's role before becoming a personal lawyer for Trump earlier that year.\n\nGiuliani has also contrasted the US government's position on Iran in his work for the Mojahedin-e Khalq (MEK), an Iranian dissident group that the State Department designated a foreign terrorist organization until 2012.\n\nHe gave a speech for the group in Warsaw, Poland, in February, the same day a Middle East ministerial led by the US began in the same city. In his comments, Giuliani called for regime change in Iran.\n\n\"In order to have peace and security in the Middle East, there has to be a major change in the theocratic dictatorship in Iran. It must end,\" Giuliani said, even though the Trump administration has called for a change in Iran's behavior, not regime change.\n\nAs Giuliani answered questions from reporters the day of the speech with his since-indicted associate Lev Parnas at his side, he clarified that the MEK paid him to give the speech in his private capacity.\n\nStill, the group's political wing, the National Council of Resistance of Iran, has repeatedly pointed to Giuliani's White House connection, calling him the \"US President's attorney\" and \"President Trump's personal attorney.\"\n\nSecretary of State Mike Pompeo downplayed Giuliani's actions when asked about them on Gray Television's \"Full Court Press with Greta Van Susteren.\"\n\nHe said it wasn't \"uncommon for private citizens to help\" the US achieve its policy goals, but that he runs the State Department. \"The ultimate responsibility falls to the United States government, for the secretary of state, to deliver on behalf of the outcomes President Trump has committed to the American people he'd achieve.\"\n\nGiuliani's work on behalf of foreign groups has led some Democratic senators to call on the Justice Department to review whether Giuliani has complied with the Foreign Agents Registration Act, or FARA, which requires that representatives of foreign governments and political organizations file public documents that disclose their arrangements.\n\nSen. Tom Udall, a New Mexico Democrat who coauthored with six other Democratic senators a letter calling for a Justice Department review, told CNN in an interview he believes Giuliani could have violated FARA.\n\n\"He's advising the President. He is being paid by foreign entities, and that is exactly what's required to be disclosed under the Foreign Agent Registration Act,\" Udall said. \"I think clearly there may be a violation of the law.\"\n\nFiona Hill, Trump's former top Russia adviser, testified in a deposition before three House committees in October that she was \"extremely concerned that whatever it was that Mr. Giuliani was doing might not be legal,\" in regards to his work in Ukraine.\n\nHill also described learning of Giuliani's planned trip to Ukraine in May. \"And there was, you know, kind of, quite a bit of consternation of the party of the State Department,\" she said.\n\nGiuliani insists he is only guilty of one thing: defending the President.\n\nWhen questioned by CNN's Drew Griffin about his international dealings, Giuliani responded, \"I am being targeted by CNN because I am proving that you are corrupt in your coverage of the President all throughout this impeachment proceeding.\""

        "title": "Giuliani Associate Says He Gave Demand for Biden Inquiry to Ukrainians",
        "text": "Not long before the Ukrainian president was inaugurated in May, an associate of Rudolph W. Giuliani's journeyed to Kiev to deliver a warning to the country's new leadership, a lawyer for the associate said.\n\nThe associate, Lev Parnas, told a representative of the incoming government that it had to announce an investigation into Mr. Trump's political rival, Joseph R. Biden Jr., and his son, or else Vice President Mike Pence would not attend the swearing-in of the new president, and the United States would freeze aid, the lawyer said.\n\nThe claim by Mr. Parnas, who is preparing to share his account with impeachment investigators, challenges the narrative of events from Mr. Trump and Ukrainian officials that is at the core of the congressional inquiry. It also directly links Mr. Giuliani, the president's personal lawyer, to threats of repercussions made to the Ukrainians, something he has strenuously denied.\n\nBut Mr. Parnas's account, while potentially significant, is being contradicted on several fronts. None of the people involved dispute that the meeting occurred, but Mr. Parnas stands alone in saying the intention was to present an ultimatum to the Ukrainian leadership.\n\nAnother participant in the meeting, Mr. Parnas's business partner, Igor Fruman, said Mr. Parnas's claim was false; the men never raised the issues of aid or the vice president's attendance at the inauguration, lawyers for Mr. Fruman said.\n\nMr. Giuliani denied Mr. Parnas's contention that he had delivered the warning at the direction of Mr. Giuliani. \"Categorically, I did not tell him to say that,\" Mr. Giuliani said.\n\nThe dispute represents the clearest indication yet that Mr. Parnas, who was indicted along with Mr. Fruman last month on campaign finance charges, has turned on Mr. Trump and Mr. Giuliani.\n\nMr. Parnas and Mr. Fruman, both Soviet-born businessmen from Florida, worked with Mr. Giuliani for months in Ukraine outside normal diplomatic channels to further Mr. Trump's interests. The men have been subpoenaed to testify before Congress, and Mr. Parnas's lawyer has said his client will comply to the extent he can without incriminating himself. It is unclear if Mr. Parnas will ultimately be called to testify.\n\nMr. Parnas's account of the meeting, if corroborated, would reveal the earliest known instance of American aid being tied to demands for Ukraine to take actions that could benefit Mr. Trump's 2020 re-election campaign. It would also represent a more extensive threat \u2014 to pull Mr. Pence from the inaugural delegation \u2014 than was previously known.\n\nMr. Trump froze nearly $400 million in military aid to Ukraine shortly before a July 25 call with the country's president, Volodymyr Zelensky, in which Mr. Trump personally sought investigations into the Bidens and claims that Ukrainians had meddled in the 2016 election. In the call, Mr. Trump did not explicitly link the aid and the investigations.\n\nMr. Trump has denied a quid pro quo involving aid, and Mr. Zelensky has said he never felt pressured to pursue an investigation.\n\nThe meeting in Kiev in May occurred after Mr. Giuliani, with Mr. Parnas's help, had planned a trip there to urge Mr. Zelensky to pursue the investigations. Mr. Giuliani canceled his trip at the last minute, claiming he was being \"set up.\"\n\nOnly three people were present at the meeting: Mr. Parnas, Mr. Fruman and Serhiy Shefir, a member of the inner circle of Mr. Zelensky, then the Ukrainian president-elect. The sit-down took place at an outdoor cafe in the days before Mr. Zelensky's May 20 inauguration, according to a person familiar with the events. The men sipped coffee and spoke in Russian, which is widely spoken in Ukraine, the person said.\n\nMr. Parnas's lawyer, Joseph A. Bondy, said the message to the Ukrainians was given at the direction of Mr. Giuliani, whom Mr. Parnas believed was acting under Mr. Trump's instruction. Mr. Giuliani said he \"never authorized such a conversation.\"\n\nA lawyer for Mr. Fruman, John M. Dowd, said his client told him the men were seeking only a meeting with Mr. Zelensky, the new president. \"There was no mention of any terms, military aid or whatever they are talking about it \u2014 it's false,\" said Mr. Dowd, who represents Mr. Fruman along with the lawyer Todd Blanche.\n\nIn a statement on Friday, Mr. Shefir acknowledged meeting with Mr. Parnas and Mr. Fruman. But he said they had not raised the issue of military aid. Mr. Shefir said he briefed the incoming president on the meeting. Mr. Shefir was a business partner and longtime friend whom Mr. Zelensky appointed as his chief adviser on the first day of his presidency.\n\n\"We did not treat Mr. Parnas and Mr. Fruman as official representatives, and therefore we did not consider that they could speak on behalf of the U.S. government,\" Mr. Shefir said. He added Mr. Parnas and Mr. Fruman had requested that Mr. Zelensky meet with Mr. Giuliani.\n\nMr. Shefir said in his statement that he had told Mr. Parnas and Mr. Fruman \"that we could consider meeting with Mr. Giuliani, but only publicly and officially and only after the inauguration of the newly elected president.\"\n\nThe statement from Mr. Shefir, issued in response to an inquiry from The New York Times, did not directly address Mr. Parnas's claims that he had delivered an ultimatum about American aid in general and Mr. Pence's attendance at the inauguration. A representative for Mr. Zelensky did not respond to a request for further comment.\n\nMr. Bondy, Mr. Parnas's lawyer, challenged Mr. Shefir's characterization. \"It would simply defy reason,\" he said, \"for Mr. Shefir to have attended a meeting with Mr. Parnas if he did not believe Mr. Parnas spoke for the president, and also for Mr. Parnas not to have conveyed the president's message at this meeting.\"\n\nMr. Pence did not attend the inauguration. His office said in response to questions from The Times that it had told Ukrainian officials on May 13, a week before the swearing-in, that the vice president would not be there.\n\nImage\nIgor Fruman, right, denied through a lawyer that he and Mr. Parnas had issued an ultimatum to Ukrainian officials in May. \nIgor Fruman, right, denied through a lawyer that he and Mr. Parnas had issued an ultimatum to Ukrainian officials in May. Credit...Jefferson Siegel/Reuters\n\nMr. Giuliani is under investigation by Manhattan prosecutors and the F.B.I. over whether he illegally engaged in lobbying for foreign interests in connection with the Ukraine efforts. He has denied any wrongdoing, saying he was working for his client, Mr. Trump.\n\nThat investigation grew out of one into Mr. Parnas and Mr. Fruman. An indictment unsealed on Oct. 10 accused the men of illegally routing a $325,000 contribution to a political action committee supporting Mr. Trump through a shell company and linked them to an effort to recall the United States ambassador to Ukraine, Marie L. Yovanovitch, who was the subject of criticism from many of Mr. Trump's allies. The men were also charged with funneling campaign contributions from a Russian businessman to other American politicians to influence them in support of a marijuana venture. The two men, and two co-defendants, have pleaded not guilty.\n\nThe impeachment inquiry was started after a whistle-blower complained about the July phone call in which Mr. Trump asked Mr. Zelensky to look into Burisma, a Ukrainian company that gave Mr. Biden's son Hunter a seat on its board and paid him as much as $50,000 a month. Mr. Trump suggested to Mr. Zelensky that Ukraine should contact Mr. Giuliani and the United States attorney general, William P. Barr, about the Bidens.\n\nWith Mr. Trump by his side at the United Nations General Assembly in September, Mr. Zelensky told reporters that his July call with the president had been \"normal\" and that \"nobody pushed me,\" adding that he did not want to become entangled in American elections."

        "text": "Former President Barack Obama offered an unusual warning to the Democratic primary field on Friday evening, cautioning the candidates not to move too far to the left in their policy proposals, even as he sought to reassure a party establishment worried about the electoral strength of their historically large primary field.\n\nRelatedObama urges Democrats to \"chill out\" about 2020 presidential field.\nSpeaking before a room of wealthy liberal donors, Mr. Obama urged Democrats to remember the long, combative slog of his primary campaign against Hillary Clinton in 2008, arguing that the 16 month battle ultimately made him a stronger general election candidate.\n\n\"For those who get stressed about robust primaries, I just have to remind you I had a very robust primary,\" he told the group of several hundred donors and organizational leaders in Washington. \"I'm confident that at the end of the process we will have a candidate that has been tested.\"\n\nYet, he also raised concerns about some of the liberal ideas being promoted by some candidates, citing health care and immigration as issues where the proposals may have gone further than public opinion.\n\nWhile Mr. Obama did not single out any specific primary candidate or policy proposal, he cautioned that the universe of voters that could support a Democratic candidate \u2014 Democrats, independents and moderate Republicans \u2014 are not driven by the same views reflected on \"certain left-leaning Twitter feeds\" or \"the activist wing of our party.\"\n\n\"Even as we push the envelope and we are bold in our vision we also have to be rooted in reality,\" Mr. Obama said. \"The average American doesn't think we have to completely tear down the system and remake it.\"\n\nThe comments marked an extraordinary entrance into the primary contest by the former president, who has been careful to avoid even the appearance of influencing the direction of the race.\n\nHis remarks offered an implicit critique of Senators Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren, who have urged voters to embrace \"political revolution\" and \"big, structural change,\" as well as proposals once widely considered to be left to the liberal fringes of the party, including court packing and decriminalizing illegal border crossings.\n\nPolitics Across the United States\nA Clash in Boston: Mayor Michelle Wu is seeking big changes in Boston. But the city's old-school power brokers are pushing back.\nPhiladelphia Mayor's Race: Cherelle Parker's win in the Democratic primary is a sign of how the city has changed, but Philadelphia's challenges remain deep and daunting.\nNorth Carolina's Abortion Ban: The state's Republican-dominated legislature upheld a bill to ban most abortions after 12 weeks, overriding the Democratic governor's recent veto.\nEven as Mr. Obama has attempted to stay out of the race, the primary candidates have engaged in a heated discussion over his legacy, debating whether to stick with Mr. Obama's architecture for health care policy or to pursue a single-payer system and offering flashes of direct criticism over his record on immigration. At the same time, former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. has made his strong support for Mr. Obama and his accomplishments a hallmark of his candidacy.\n\n\nWho's Running for President in 2020?\nThe field of Democratic presidential candidates has been historically large, but all have dropped out except Joe Biden, the presumptive Democratic nominee to challenge President Trump.\n\nAcknowledging that candidates must \"push past\" his achievements, Mr. Obama urged his party's candidates not to push too far, as he urged them to adopt a message that would allow them to compete in all corners of the country.\n\n\"I don't think we should be deluded into thinking that the resistance to certain approaches to things is simply because voters haven't heard a bold enough proposal and if they hear something as bold as possible then immediately that's going to activate them,\" he said.\n\nThe fact that Mr. Obama offered his reassurances at the annual meeting of the Democracy Alliance, a club of wealthy liberals who donate hundreds of thousands of dollars a year to recommended political organizations, only underscored the intended audience of his message. In recent weeks, establishment-aligned Democrats, top donors and some strategists have expressed fears that the party lacks a strong enough candidate to defeat President Trump.\n\nThey question whether Mr. Biden has the ability to compete in a multistate primary campaign, fret about Mr. Sanders's and Ms. Warren's viability in the general election and remain skeptical that Pete Buttigieg, the mayor of South Bend, Ind., can broaden his appeal beyond white voters.\n\nTheir concerns have prompted the late emergence of two experienced candidates, Deval Patrick, the former governor of Massachusetts and a close friend of Mr. Obama, and Michael R. Bloomberg, both of whom entered the field after nine candidates had already dropped out.\n\nThose worries are not necessarily shared by voters in early states, where surveys show that most Democrats have gravitated to a short list of four candidates and feel the field remains too large.\n\n\"If you talk to the voters they don't feel the need for another candidate,\" said Kathy Sullivan, the former chairwoman of the Democratic Party in New Hampshire. \"We haven't been sitting around in New Hampshire saying we need a hero to come and rescue us.\"\n\nSince leaving office nearly three years ago, the former president has mostly remained out of the public fray.\n\nWhile he's headlined fund-raising events for Democratic committees, the former president has kept a low profile in the presidential race, meeting privately with most of the Democratic candidates but telling friends and political allies that neither he nor his wife, Michelle, have plans to endorse anyone and do not see it as their place to steer the party's future.\n\nMr. Obama has expressed interest, at different times, in rising stars like former Representative Beto O'Rourke of Texas and Mr. Buttigieg. Mr. Obama had issued a warm statement about Mr. Biden's entry into the primary but had declined to endorse him or anyone else.\n\nDuring his nearly hourlong remarks on Friday, Mr. Obama offered only one clear endorsement, though not exactly the one many Democratic donors in the room wanted to hear.\n\nMr. Obama was interviewed by Stacey Abrams, who drew national attention during her unsuccessful run for governor of Georgia last year and is widely considered to be on the shortlist for the vice presidency \u2014 no matter which candidate ultimately wins the nomination.\n\n\"I love me some Stacey Abrams,\" he said."

The states and DC would direct the revenues from the plan toward mass transit projects designed to reduce carbon emissions, which may include mass transit, electric-vehicle charging and other transportation infrastructure.\n\nThe plan calls for gasoline and diesel wholesalers to pay the states for emissions allowances. Critics fear the wholesalers will simply pass the new costs directly through to consumers, and are calling it nothing more than a gasoline tax, according to Politico.\n\nThe other states invested in the plan, called the \"Transportation and Climate Initiative,\" are Connecticut, Delaware, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont, Maine and New Hampshire.\n\nAccording to the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy, Virginians pay 21.95 cents per gallon of gasoline, while DC drivers pay 23.50 cents a gallon. That included all state and local taxes and fees as of Oct. 1.\n\nGasoline taxes have been a robust and reliable source of revenue for states, but the country's speedy shift into greener transportation is giving them pause. Many state legislatures are growing leery regarding the long-term viability of taxing fuel receipts as the electric car market continues to flex.\n\nThe scribes drafting TCI prefer the term \"allowances\" rather than tax, saying their \"cap-and-invest\" program would work like this:\n\nPlacing a \"cap\" on carbon pollution from burning fossil fuels in the transportation sector to reduce transportation emissions.\nRequiring large gasoline and diesel fuel suppliers to hold allowances for the pollution that results from the combustion of the fuels that they sell to consumers.\nBringing in proceeds that can be used to fund programs such as increasing public transit.\nDavid Blackmon, an independent energy analyst/consultant, criticized the plan in a Forbes column, calling it a \"regional gas tax scheme.\"\n\n\"Everyone involved knows that those wholesalers will pass along those costs to consumers, but the vast majority of consumers will never understand why the cost of filling their cars suddenly went up,\" he wrote. \"They'll just see a higher cost at the pump and \u2014 conveniently, for the governors involved \u2014 most will just blame it on that evil conspiracy by 'big oil' to make those 'windfall profits.' \"\n\nThe states see it as nothing quite so sinister, and lawmakers will weigh in on the final draft and any increased taxes.\n\nRepublican in Virginia's General Assembly opposed the move to join both TCI and the nine-state carbon-trading network known as the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, putting language in the budget that prohibits spending money on the RGGI connection. Democratic Gov. Ralph Northam did not veto that budget language, reports the Virginia Mercury. But with this week's election of Democratic majorities in both houses of the Virginia legislature, the door is open to change next year.\n\nIf the states approve TCI, the 10-year program of reducing emissions would start in 2022 and continue through 2032.\n\nWritten by Rich Kirby/Patch Staff with additional reporting by Deb Belt/Patch Staff"

Now it is our duty to serve and protect them every single day of our lives.\" More than 100 protesters booed and held black balloons that read \"support our troops, impeach.\"\n\nButtigieg, the 37-year-old mayor of South Bend, Indiana, said female veterans and service members have been neglected, including on concerns about sexual harassment and women's health. Women are the military's fastest-growing subgroup.\n\n\"I think leadership plays a huge role so absolutely I'd seek to name a woman to lead VA,\" Buttigieg, a former Navy intelligence officer, said in an interview with The Associated Press. His comments went a step beyond his 21-page wide-ranging plan released on Monday.\n\n\"The president has let veterans down,\" Buttigieg said.\n\nOf the Cabinet and Cabinet-level roles, four have never been held by a woman: Veterans Affairs, Defense, Treasury and White House chief of staff. Buttigieg says he'd take a close look at appointing a female defense secretary as well.\n\nFormer Vice President Joe Biden said he would seek to build on substantial gains for vets that were started under the Obama-Biden administration, such as stemming homelessness and improving mental health care.\n\nBiden said he would \"restore trust\" in the VA after failed leadership, putting in place at least one full-time women's primary care physician at each VA medical center to boost women's health care and provide $300 million to better understand the impact of traumatic brain injury.\n\nHe said as president he would publish a comprehensive strategy to address veterans' suicide within his first 200 days in office and hire additional staff to ensure that in his first year of office wait times for vets at risk of suicide are reduce to zero.\n\n\"Our veterans deserve leaders who will fight for them as ardently and as forcefully as they have fought for us,\" Biden wrote in a Veterans Day statement with his wife Jill.\n\nIn a dig at Trump, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders released a video on Monday highlighting his role in working with the late Republican Sen. John McCain, a decorated war hero, to pass legislation that included the Veterans Choice program in 2014.\n\nTrump routinely takes credit for being the first to enact the Choice program, ignoring the fact that it was signed into law by President Barack Obama. What Trump got done was an expansion of the program achieved by McCain and Sanders.\n\nThat expanded program, one of Trump's signature accomplishments, seeks to steer more veterans over the next decade to private-sector doctors outside the VA.\n\nSanders, a former chairman of the Senate Veterans Affairs Committee who voted against Trump's plan, says the expanded program goes too far in its investments in the private sector, rather than core VA health care , which many veterans view as better suited to treat battlefield injuries such as post-traumatic stress disorder. Sanders joins Buttigieg and Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren in urging increases in doctor pay to attract top VA candidates and fill 49,000 VA positions that have sat vacant as the Trump administration promoted private health care options.\n\nSanders said he would fill those vacancies in his first year as president and provide at least $62 billion in new funding to repair and modernize VA facilities to provide cutting-edge care.\n\n\"We will not dismantle or privatize the VA. We will expand and improve the VA,\" Sanders said Monday.\n\nButtigieg told the AP that he would look at rolling back some of the Trump administration's rules expanding Choice.\n\nAll the Democratic candidates who have articulated veterans' plans call for added funding and training for suicide prevention.\n\nCurrently, about 20 veterans die by suicide each day, a rate basically unchanged during the Trump administration. Trump earlier this year directed a Cabinet-level task force to develop a broader roadmap for veterans' suicide prevention, due out next spring.\n\nButtigieg, like Warren, would seek to improve responses to sexual assault in the military by shifting prosecution from military commanders to independent prosecutors. He also wants to put particular focus on stemming homelessness among women vets, many of whom may have experienced sexual trauma .\n\nHe pointed to his seven-month deployment in Afghanistan in 2014 and watching the impact a female general had \"culturally\" on the NATO-led International Security Assistance Force.\n\n\"When a leadership body is more gender diverse, it makes better decisions. So I would absolutely be looking at that,\" Buttigieg told the AP. He's previously pledged to appoint women to at least 50% of his Cabinet positions.\n\nWhile veterans overall have strongly backed Trump throughout his presidency, views vary widely by party, gender and age, according to AP VoteCast, a survey of 2018 midterm voters. In particular, younger veterans and women generally were more skeptical of Trump, who received multiple draft deferments to avoid going to Vietnam.\n\nCurrently, about 10% of the nation's veterans are female. In the U.S. military forces, about 17% of those enlisted are women, up from about 2% in 1973."

This has advocates concerned that many foster children -- who usually don't drive or have cars \u2013 won't have their voices heard, cleveland.com's Laura Hancock reports.\n\nReading supplements: On Friday the federal government announced research showing that vitamin E has ended up in lung fluid in some people who have vaped illicit THC. Hancock discusses the newest research and compares it to a study last month out of Cleveland Clinic also looking at the effect of Vitamin E oil in e-cig cartridges.\n\nTime to re-up: The Ohio Medical Marijuana Advisory Committee will have its first meeting in six months on Dec. 12. Regulators hadn't scheduled a meeting in months, saying that the committee's chair had retired, leaving the group without a leader. On Nov. 1, Gov. Mike DeWine appointed Board of Pharmacy member Megan Marchal as chair.\n\nWhy you were off work: Among those being honored on Veterans Day were an estimated 752,000 veterans living in Ohio, the biggest share of whom served during the Vietnam era, according to census estimates. Among Ohio's veterans, 271,877 (36%) served during the Vietnam era, cleveland.com's census guy Rich Exner reports. In comparison, an estimated 95,323 served since September 2001, 126,298 during the Gulf War period of August 1990 to August 2001, and 70,144 during the Korean War era, and 41,063 from World War II.\n\nStaying busy: Mike DeWine has \"kept up a frenetic pace\" as governor, packing every day \u2013 and, often, evenings \u2013 with policy meetings and public appearances, according to a review of his appointment calendar by the Columbus Dispatch's Randy Ludlow. The governor's schedule through July 31 included \u2013 among other things \u2013 calls with members of President Trump's cabinet, at least five events for state lawmakers at the governor's residence, working the phones to lobby legislators to pass his gas tax increase, and taking a 45-minute sexual harassment awareness training course.\n\nYou bet: In the wake of the U.S. Supreme Court's 2018 decision allowing states to legalize sports betting, Ohio lawmakers have introduced competing bills about what legalized sports gambling would look like in the state. The Dispatch's Anna Staver has an overview of the two pieces of legislation: a Senate bill that would legalize sports betting at casinos and racinos, and a House bill that would allow more generalized sports gambling, including at fraternal organizations, veterans groups, and bars with lottery terminals.\n\nTeam players: With sports gambling all but certain to be legalized soon, professional sports leagues have changed course from opposing legalization to demanding a cut of the action. As Jackie Borchardt of the Cincinnati Enquirer writes, most Ohio sports teams \u2013 including the Cleveland Indians and Browns, Cincinnati Reds and Bengals, and the Columbus Crew \u2013 are pushing Ohio lawmakers to require sportsbooks to use data compiled by pro teams and authorized partners for bets.\n\nWorking a desk job: The Washington Post's Daily 202 newsletter on Monday gave a big plug to U.S. Sen. Sherrod Brown's new book, \"Desk 88,\" in which he profiles eight liberal Democrats who have sat at the same desk on the Senate floor that he now occupies. The Ohio Democrat also said he has no regrets about not running for president in 2020. \"I thought really seriously about it in January and February, and I thought there was a path, but I don't look back,\" he said.\n\nTwo sides to every purge: A Monday piece from RealClearPolitics' Mark Hemingway examines a recent article from the New York Times about Ohio's recent voter purge, largely by presenting Secretary of State Frank LaRose's view of the story. The headline reads: \"Charges of Ohio Voter List \u2018Purge' Prove to Be Unfounded.\" LaRose's office apparently liked the result: they shared it with their media distribution list shortly after it published. Read more here.\n\nBailing in: \"The Ohio Supreme Court is considering changing the state's rules for setting bail in criminal cases, which could have a big impact on the liberty of thousands of Ohioans and on how much taxpayers pay for jail expenses,\" writes Laura Bischoff of the Dayton Daily News. \"The rule change could affect the fates of roughly 11,000 people on any given day in Ohio who are awaiting their day in court.\"\n\nTalking the talk as well: Justin Herdman, the U.S. attorney for the Northern District of Ohio, is spotlighted in a New York Times story by Adam Goldman about how federal law enforcement officials are speaking more forthrightly about fighting domestic terrorism, showing that the U.S. Justice Department is combating racist and politically motivated violence as the 2020 elections approach. Herdman's tactics include speaking with a group of prominent black pastors about the prospect that a gunman could target one of their congregations.\n\nDisconnect: Liz Moughon of the Wall Street Journal has a beautiful photo essay detailing the problems that people in Southeast Ohio face because they lack broadband internet access: from difficulties doing homework to tracking orders at a dairy farm.\n\nFull Disclosure\nFive things we learned from the May 14 ethics disclosure of state Sen. Terry Johnson, a McDermott Republican:\n\n1. In 2018, Johnson was paid at least $100,000 as a physician with Valley View Health Care Center and in retirement payments. He also earned $67,084 as a state representative, $25,000 to $49,999 as an assistant dean at Ohio University's clinical campus at the Southern Ohio Medical Center in Portsmouth, and $10,000 to $24,999 each from investment income, military retirement benefits, and rental income from a condo in Sanibel Island, Florida.\n\n2. He may have been hungry when he shopped for stocks \u2013 as of 2018, he was a shareholder in El Pollo Loco and McDonald's. He also owns stock in eight other companies, as well as investments in 35 different mutual funds and seven exchange-traded funds.\n\n3. In addition to his personal residence, he listed owning five pieces of property in Scioto County.\n\n4. Last year, he received gifts worth at least $75 from the Ohio Osteopathic Association and Awake America \u2013 Ohio, an organization that encourages Baptist pastors to lobby state lawmakers on social issues.\n\n5. The state reimbursed him $1,685 for mileage in 2018 for travel between his home and Columbus. He was also paid $442 in travel expenses by the Association of American Physicians and Surgeons.\n\nStraight From The Source\n\"At a time that when our nation seems so divided there is something that brings all of us together: the sacrifice of our veterans.

        "text": "The state House is not expected to vote or take attendance at its session Wednesday before breaking for hunting season and Thanksgiving, making a resolution before December of the impasse over the 2020 budget less likely.\n\nHowever, the House will add one additional session day on Wednesday, Nov. 20, and if a deal is reached before then between Democratic Gov. Gretchen Whitmer and Republican legislative leaders, it could be voted on that day, said Gideon D'Assandro, a spokesman for House Speaker Lee Chatfield, R-Levering.\n\nThe developments come as affected groups are becoming more vocal about funds that were cut from a wide range of programs as a result of 147 line-item vetoes, totaling close to $1 billion, exercised by Whitmer in an effort to get the GOP-controlled Legislature to renegotiate key parts of the budget.\n\nMost likely, \"it's going to be a few weeks before we know if we're going to get a supplemental done,\" Whitmer said. \"I'm concerned about it. We're almost a quarter way into the fiscal year at that juncture and (affected groups and agencies) are going to be feeling it.\"\n\nBut Whitmer said the budget lawmakers sent her was \"fatally flawed\" and needs to be reworked. \"They've shortchanged a lot of the departments and we're feeling it as well,\" she said.\n\nThe House added the Wednesday session last week in case a dispute between Whitmer and the Legislature was resolved.\n\nBut on Tuesday, the House announced no votes or attendance are planned Wednesday, before the chamber goes on break, though the Nov. 20 meeting date will also be added. The Senate was meeting Tuesday and Wednesday before going on break until Dec. 3.\nThe Michigan Association of Public School Academies, representing charter schools, plans a Wednesday morning news conference outside Whitmer's office to protest one of the vetoes, which killed a $240-per-pupil increase proposed for charter schools.\n\nOn Monday, Air Force veteran Stephanie Zarb, who was co-chair of the Veterans for Whitmer group in the 2018 election campaign, said on the Michigan Radio program \"Stateside\" that two programs for veterans that would be cut as a result of the vetoes are \"critical,\" and more important than some other state-funded veteran programs. Those programs are grants to counties that help veterans access federal programs and the Buddy to Buddy program through the University of Michigan, through which veterans with PTSD can turn to other veterans for help.\n\nAn end to the impasse appeared close Thursday morning after Whitmer and Chatfield reportedly agreed in principle to a budget deal, without making details public. But talks fell apart after Senate Majority Leader Mike Shirkey, R-Clarklake, said he wants Whitmer to sign a bill that will restrict the powers of the State Administrative Board \u2014 currently dominated by Democratic elected officials and gubernatorial appointees \u2014 to move funds within departments without legislative approval.\n\nWhitmer has repeatedly said she will not sign any bill that limits her powers or those of future governors.\n\n\"We were very close last week,\" Whitmer said. \"We had a bipartisan deal that we all were excited about in the form of a supplemental (spending bill). Sen. Shirkey decided not to go along with it.\"\n\nWhitmer said she used vetoes to cut $947 million and used the State Administrative Board to shift more than $600 million because lawmakers sent her a budget without her input during the final stages. She said the budget endangers health and safety by underfunding certain prison programs and by not providing money to help Medicaid recipients comply with new work requirements, among other problems.\n\nThe Pure Michigan tourism promotion campaign, autism support, rural policing and hospitals, and grants to counties in lieu of taxes for state-owned land are among other programs cut as a result of the vetoes.\n\nWhitmer said the state might have to close up to two prisons if the budget is left in the form passed by the Legislature.\n\n\"I'm hopeful that over the next couple of weeks, while they're on their hunting and holiday break, that they'll come back and get serious and send something to my desk posthaste.\""

        "text": "President Donald Trump is falsely suggesting that Thursday's stock market decline was driven primarily by the impeachment inquiry.\n\nThe S&P 500 was down about 0.5% Thursday morning as the House convened to vote on the ground rules for its impeachment inquiry and eventually closed with a decline of 0.3%. Analysts say investors likely had other issues in mind as they sold stocks.\n\nA look at Trump's claim Thursday on Twitter as stocks dropped a day after setting their second record this week:\n\nTRUMP: \"The Impeachment Hoax is hurting our Stock Market. The Do Nothing Democrats don't care!\"\n\nTHE FACTS: Trump neglects to mention the factors that Wall Street experts say really moved the market.\n\nThe stock market is more concerned with the U.S.-China trade war, the strength of the global and U.S. economy, interest rates and corporate profits than the impeachment inquiry.\n\nFor instance, on Thursday, analysts pinned the market's drop largely on a weak report on business activity in the Midwest and worries about the trade war with China that Trump himself began.\n\nSince House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., announced a formal impeachment inquiry on Sept. 24, the S&P 500 has risen 2.4%, and it reached record highs twice this week.\n\nIt's tough to tease out for certain the impact of the impeachment proceedings given all the moving parts that go into setting stock prices. But many investors on Wall Street see impeachment having only a modest effect at most, and one unlikely to last for long.\n\nThat's chiefly because few see a real threat of Trump ultimately getting removed from office by Congress. Even if the House impeaches the president for asking another country to investigate a political opponent, investors tend to believe the Republican-controlled Senate will likely acquit him. That would mean Trump and his lower-tax, less-regulation approach that markets like is unlikely to leave the White House, at least until after the next election.\n\n\"Yes, investors are aware of it, but it doesn't have any direct policy implications right now,\" Kate Warne, chief investment strategist at Edward Jones, said about the inquiry.\n\nWhen asked where it ranks in the list of concerns for the stock market, Eric Freedman, the chief investment officer at U.S. Bank Wealth Management, reels off other issues, such as interest-rate policy, economic growth trends, corporate profits and trade wars.\n\n\"I would put impeachment issues at the bottom of that stack,\" Freedman said.\n\nOne risk investors do see is that the impeachment inquiry leaves less oxygen for other discussions on Capitol Hill. Does it lengthen the timeline for reaching a trade deal with China, for example? Does it snuff out hopes that Washington could pass legislation on prescription drug pricing or infrastructure?\n\nInvestors would also like to see progress on the trade agreement involving the United States, Mexico and Canada, known as USMCA. There, though, the impeachment inquiry may provide a counterintuitive boon.\n\n\"Is it possible that both Republicans and Democrats now want to hurry through the USMCA deal as a way to show some positive chips with constituents who, on one side of the aisle or another, are not happy with impeachment?\" asked Paul Christopher, head of global market strategy for Wells Fargo Investment Institute.\n\nPast impeachments have affected the stock market, but only temporarily. Investors eventually returned their focus to what really matters for a stock's price: how much profit a company is making and whether that will rise or fall in the future.\n\nIn 1974, an energy crisis and recession were what drove the stock market lower, not President Richard Nixon's resignation, strategists at Citi Private Bank wrote in a recent report.\n\nIn 1998, the S&P 500 sank sharply on the day that Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr delivered his report to Congress on possible impeachable offenses by President Bill Clinton. But worries about slumping economies abroad were the bigger concern for investors at the time.\n\nStocks would eventually rise, even after the House voted to impeach Clinton, until they blew up in the 2000 dot-com bubble."

        "text": "How much citizen participation is the right amount of citizen participation at a governmental meeting? You want some. But you don't want too much.\n\nAs with so much in life, it can be difficult to arrive at just the right amount.\n\nIn the furtherance of citizen communication, your Texas Legislature this year approved House Bill 2840, authored by Rep. Terry Canales, D-Edinburg, and \"relating to the right of a member of the public to address the governing body of a political subdivision at an open meeting of the body.\"\n\nThe bill analysis presented the problem: \"It has been suggested that the practice of the governing bodies of certain political subdivisions to provide for public input and comment only at the conclusion of a meeting of the governing body makes it too difficult for the public to properly weigh in on decisions being made because they are forced to wait through the entire meeting to provide an opinion on any subject matter being addressed at the meeting.\"\n\nHere's how the bill, signed into law by Gov. Greg Abbott, addresses that: \"A governmental body shall allow each member of the public who desires to address the body regarding an item on an agenda for an open meeting of the body to address the body regarding the item at a meeting before or during the body's consideration of the item.\"\n\nSeems reasonable. The new law also says a governmental body \"may adopt reasonable rules regarding the public's right to address the body under this section, including rules that limit the total amount of time that a member of the public may address the body on a given item.\"\n\nSimple, right?\n\nMaybe not, says Deborah Earley, the duly elected county attorney for Blanco County. She has a question about the \"before or during\" language above. And she has that question because of somebody in Blanco County. Let's let her detail the dilemma, as she did in a recent request for an attorney general's opinion.\n\n\"At a recent commissioners court meeting, the commissioners court permitted public comments at the beginning of the meeting,\" she told Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton. \"The commissioners limited public comments to three minutes per person.\"\n\nOnce again, seems reasonable. And it seems all went well, for a while. Back to Earley: \"One member of the public wanted to comment on 17 of the 21 items.\"\n\nSo there was, we shall call him, \"that guy.\" In government, as in life, there often is \"that guy.\"\n\n\"He argued that the subsection (b) required the commissioners to allow him to discuss each agenda item immediately prior to discussion of that item,\" Earley told Paxton. \"It was the county's opinion that subsection (b) did not require that and that allowing the public to interrupt court 17 different times would be disruptive to the efficient flow of government.\"\n\n(I'll continue after you're done chortling about \"the efficient flow of government.\")\n\n\"The party then argued that if the county was going to have all public comments at the beginning of court that he was still allowed three minutes per item,\" Earley wrote. \"That would give him 51 minutes of time.\"\n\nThat would be a lot, and one can see how that could constitute a disruption of the efficient flow of government.\n\n\"Obviously,\" Earley wrote, foreshadowing the obvious, \"if every member of the public (who) wanted to speak got three minutes per item, commissioners would not be able to have an effective meeting.\"\n\nI've done the math. She's correct. Blanco County has 11,626 residents. So if the 11,621 who aren't on the Commissioners Dourt each got 51 minutes, that would eat up 592,671 minutes (or just under 10,000 hours), which I believe we can agree could be an impediment to the efficient flow of government. (Caveat: I think it's probable that some toddlers would not use their full allotment of time and others might have trouble staying on topic.)\n\n\"It is the county's position that the county can limit a speaker to a reasonable amount of time in total and not just per item,\" Earley said in her request for an attorney general opinion.\n\nHere are her questions to Paxton: \"Is the county required to let the public speak immediately before each agenda item?\" and \"if the county has a policy of three minutes per item, can the county also regulate the total time a speaker can have?\"\n\nGood questions. Paxton, what say you?"

Eric Holcomb and other state GOP leaders to call for Hill's resignation after they became public last year.\n\nHill's video mentions legal actions against drug companies over the national opioid crisis and defending state laws imposing additional abortion restrictions. It shows images of Hill with President Donald Trump interspersed with favorite national conservative attack targets such as U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez.\n\n\"I stood with President Trump,\" Hill says in the video. \"I'll never back down from partisan attacks, the media, and even Republicans embarrassed to defend our values.\"\n\nHill has denied doing anything wrong and a special prosecutor declined to file criminal charges over the allegations from a state lawmaker and three legislative staffers during the March 2018 party at an Indianapolis bar marking the end of that year's legislative session.\n\nThe Indiana Supreme Court is awaiting a hearing officer's report before deciding any law license sanctions. The court's options range from dismissing the complaint, a reprimand and temporary suspension or permanent removal of Hill's law license, which he needs under state law to serve as state government's top lawyer.\n\nThe Republican attorney general nominee will be picked at the state party convention next summer ahead of the November 2020 election.\n\nHolcomb, Lt.

He's fueled that support with news conferences about the discovery of more than 2,400 sets of fetal remains at Chicago-area properties linked to a deceased Indiana abortion doctor and appearances on Fox News to discuss topics such as San Francisco's troubles with homelessness.\n\nHill was elected last November as vice chairman of the national Republican Attorneys General Association, which provided about half of the $1.5 million he spent in easily winning election over a little-known Democrat in 2016.\n\nIndiana Democratic Party Chairman John Zody called Hill \"a disgrace.\"\n\n\"His conduct is below the standard of an elected official, let alone the state's top law enforcement officer,\" Zody said. \"In his announcement, Hill lights the fuse on what could be a powder keg of a Republican convention by openly taunting Governor Holcomb and other Indiana Republicans.\"\n\nHill testified during an attorney disciplinary hearing last month that he briefly touched Democratic Rep. Mara Candelaria Reardon's back while leaning in to hear what she was saying during the party and was startled to realize she was wearing a backless dress. Hill said \"absolutely not\" when asked whether he grabbed Reardon's buttocks, an allegation she made from the witness stand.\n\nReardon testified that Hill, smelling of alcohol and with glassy eyes, was holding a drink in his right hand and put his left hand on her shoulder, then slid his hand down her dress to clench her buttocks. \"A squeeze, a firm grasp,\" she said.\n\nHill, 58, also refuted testimony from the three female staffers \u2014 ages 23 to 26 at the time \u2014 that he inappropriately touched their backs or buttocks and made unwelcomed sexual comments to them."

Smaller ones, located closer to where incarcerated youth live, would clear the way for better treatment for young offenders and less recidivism, the group says.\n\nThe state's Department of Juvenile Justice wants to replace its large youth correctional center west of Richmond \u2014 with more than 260 beds \u2014 with smaller, regional and treatment-oriented lock-ups around the state, and provide more education, training, athletics, counseling and other services to help young inmates reform.\n\nRise for Youth joined with Isle of Wight County residents to kill the department's bid to open a replacement facility, of 70 beds, to house youth from Hampton Roads and eastern Virginia. That proposal was to be a first step toward closing Bon Air and replacing it with smaller regional facilities. The department has also been housing some young offenders in local detention centers in their home cities and counties.\n\nIt closed the last of its other juvenile prisons in 2017, and used the funds freed up from that to vastly expand community services.\n\nWard said Virginia incarcerates too many minority youth and needs to work harder to offer the kind of education and employment opportunities that keep young people from being tempted to crime.\n\nA recent study by the Commonwealth Institute for Fiscal Analysis and Rise for Youth found that while 21% of Virginia teens are African Americans, 72% of the youth in DJJ custody are African American."

        "text": "Politicians and educational advocates are debating the merits \u2014 and costs \u2014 of recommendations for Maryland's public schools made by the Kirwan Commission. Here are answers to some key questions about one of Maryland's most significant public policy issues.\n\nWhat is the Kirwan Commission?\n\nThe Maryland General Assembly created the commission in 2016 with the charge of making recommendations on how to prepare students for college or the workforce so they can \"meet the challenges of a changing global economy\" and \"be successful citizens in the 21st century.\"\n\nIt's officially called the \"Commission on Innovation and Excellence in Education,\" but many people call it the \"Kirwan Commission,\" after its chairman, William E. \"Brit\" Kirwan. A former chancellor of the University System of Maryland and former president of the University of Maryland, College Park, he was appointed chairman jointly by Gov. Larry Hogan, the state Senate president and the state House speaker.\n\nThe 26-member commission is comprised of several state lawmakers, the state's schools superintendent, Hogan's budget secretary, the chancellor of the university system and representatives from state and local school boards, teachers' unions, school administrators, parents and others.\n\nWhat's it recommended?\n\nThe commission studied educational policy for two years, including looking at what's worked in other states and countries.\n\nSome of the highlights of their recommendations are:\n\nExpanding prekindergarten to all 4-year-olds, as well as 3-year-olds from poor families.\nIncreasing the standards to become a teacher and raising teacher salaries.\nRevamping high schools to offer students training for well-paying jobs right after graduation.\nEstablishing more \"community schools\" with additional services for students and their families.\nProviding more support to special education students and schools with concentrations of poor families.\nCreating an accountability program to make sure money for education goes where it's supposed to.\nHow much will all this cost?\n\nAll of those programs would cost significantly more money then what's spent now on education in Maryland.\n\nThe commission envisions phasing in new and expanded programs over 10 years. By that time, the state and local school systems would be putting a total of about $4 billion more into public schools per year than they would be if spending stayed on its current course.\n\nThe state's share of the increase would be $2.8 billion at the full-phase in, while local governments would pay $1.2 billion more combined.\n\nThe city of Baltimore would bear one of the most significant cost increases: $340 million by 2030.\n\nWho's paying for it?\n\nThe state government and local governments jointly pay for public education, and that wouldn't change for the programs the commission is suggesting.\n\nThe impacts of the funding formulas vary from county to county, breaking down the amount they will contribute for costs vs. the state's contributions. Some school districts would have to come up with significantly more money, while others would need minimal to no changes on how much local money would go into schools.\n\nLocal governments get most revenue from property taxes and a county-level income tax. So, counties that need to put significantly more into public schools could look to those areas to raise money.\n\nThe state's share is likely to come from a variety of sources. State lawmakers passed a bill in 2019 that puts Kirwan programs into the budget for three years.\n\nBeyond those initial years, lawmakers are considering an array of options to raise money, from legalizing sports betting to boosting the state's tobacco tax to applying the state sales tax to downloads of digital media, such as e-books and music.\n\nHouse Speaker Adrienne A. Jones and Senate President Bill Ferguson have pledged to pass the Kirwan bill without across-the-board increases in the state's sales, income or property taxes.\n\nAre my taxes going to go up by $6,000?\n\nThat's something Hogan has said, but it's highly unlikely that every Maryland family would face a tax hike of that magnitude.\n\nThe Hogan administration came up with that number by combining the extra funding needed for Kirwan with the estimated effects of a possible recession and future years' estimated budget shortfalls, for a total of $18.7 billion. The administration then divided that among the state's 3 million taxpayers to get an estimate of $6,000 or more per family.\n\nThe future budget shortfall is a dubious measure to use, because the state is required each year to have a balanced budget \u2014 essentially, the governor and lawmakers each year have to make adjustments to make sure any projected deficit does not materialize.\n\nBoosters of the Kirwan plan have said some of the programs can be paid for with regular growth in state revenues, plus potential new sources of money that are being debated.\n\nLocal governments are evaluating whether they'd have to raise property or income taxes to pay their share.\n\nWhen will I find out if taxes will go up?\n\nState lawmakers will review the governor's proposed budget and consider any tax changes during the General Assembly session that runs through mid-April.\n\nThe Kirwan recommendations, and how to pay for them, are expected to be the most intensely debated topic during the session.\n\nLocal governments approve their budgets in May and June.\n\nWhy is Hogan opposing this plan?\n\nHogan has said the Kirwan plans are unaffordable and has rebranded the commission as the \"Kirwan Tax Hike Commission.\" He has criticized the commission's work as \"well-meaning,\" but \"half-baked\" and \"fiscally irresponsible.\"\n\nWhile Hogan has criticized the commission in speeches and social media, he declined an invitation to meet with the commission.\n\nHogan's budget secretary, David Brinkley, is a member of the commission and has raised concerns on the governor's behalf.\n\nWho's for the Kirwan recommendations?\n\nThe Maryland State Education Association, the statewide teachers' union, is backing the Kirwan proposals.\n\nThe union planned to spend $500,000 on television ads to support the additional school funding, and created a pro-Kirwan website, marylandblueprint.org.\n\nDuring the 2019 General Assembly session, MSEA spent $784,000 on lobbying, the most of any cause.\n\nA statewide nonprofit coalition called Strong Schools Maryland is promoting the Kirwan plan as a \"once-in-a-generation opportunity to build a world-class education system.\"\n\nSeveral other advocacy groups support the recommendations, including the ACLU, Advocates for Children and Youth and Baltimoreans for Educational Equity."

Ilhan Omar, D-Minn., has revived accusations of anti-Semitism against the freshman congresswoman and member of the far-left \"Squad.\"\n\nThe remark, posted ahead of Omar's scheduled appearance at a CAIR (Council of American Islamic Relations) event in Washington, also drew a response from tennis legend Martina Navratilova, who accused Omar of \"assigning labels.\"\n\nOmar's defenders, however, claimed that charges of anti-Semitism against her were overblown, and that Omar's critics were \"obsessed with every word Ilhan says or tweets.\"\n\nEarly Saturday afternoon, Omar reacted to a news report that said businessman Leon Cooperman had decided to back billionaire Michael Bloomberg for president. Both men are billionaires and Jewish.\n\n\"I wonder why?\" came Omar's response, which included a \"thinking\" emoji.\n\nSoon, critics were reacting to Omar's message.\n\n\"I suppose you think it's all about the Benjamins,\" wrote Michael Dickson, executive director of Stand with Us, a group that fights anti-Semitism. \"We get your insinuation. True to form.\"\n\n\"Omar very carefully making an anti-Semitic tweet with just enough vagueness to claim that ackshually [sic] she meant it was about the benjamins and not about religion,\" Twitter user Josh Jordan wrote. \"But everyone knows what she meant, which is why she continues to do it.\"\n\n\"Ilhan Omar doesn't tweet alone,\" observed Hen Mazzig, an Israeli-Jewish activist. \"She has a media team who's [sic] job is to prevent her from saying offensive things.

Bernie Sanders, for president.\n\nBut the reactions of Omar's defenders also drew responses.\n\n\"There is no effort to twist anything and you know this,\" Twitter user Michael Elgort wrote, addressing Greenberg. \"Dogwhistles are called like that on purpose and have meaning behind it. At the same time there are news on Bezos who chatted with Bloomberg, but she picks another billionaire who happens to be Jewish.\"\n\n\"I am a progressive who lives in [Omar's] district,\" a Twitter user named Max wrote to Sarsour, \"and there is no doubt in my mind that [Omar] has something against Jewish people.\"\n\nWhoops! We couldn't access this Tweet.\nOmar's tweet came as she was preparing to address CAIR at the group's annual gala in Washington. It was at a CAIR event in March that Omar made her much criticized \"some people did something\" remark about the terror attacks of Sept. 11, the New York Post reported.\n\nThe congresswoman has insisted on several occasions that she does not hold anti-Semitic views. In February, for example, Omar posted an apology after comments in which she implied that AIPAC [American Israel Public Affairs Committee], a prominent pro-Israel lobby, compensated U.S. lawmakers for their support of the Jewish state.\n\n\"Anti-Semitism is real and I am grateful for Jewish allies and colleagues who are educating me on the painful history of anti-Semitic tropes,\" Omar wrote on Twitter. \"My intention is never to offend my constituents or Jewish Americans as a whole. We have to always be willing to step back and think through criticism, just as I expect people to hear me when others attack me for my identity. This is why I unequivocally apologize.\"\n\n\"At the same time,\" she added, \"I reaffirm the problematic role of lobbyists in our politics, whether it be AIPAC [the American Israel Public Affairs Committee], the [National Rifle Association] or the fossil fuel industry. It's gone on too long and we must be willing to address it.\"\n\nOmar and fellow \"Squad\" member Rep. Rashida Tlaib, D-Mich., have been targets of a petition by the American Center for Law and Justice, which calls for the lawmakers to face censure in Congress over remarks deemed as anti-Semitic. As of Sunday morning, the petition had more than 235,000 signatures, according to the group's website."

        "title": "Republicans Argue Impeachment Case Falls Short of Proving Trump Misconduct",
        "text": "House Republicans on Saturday offered the latest glimpse of their strategy to fight against impeachment by demanding testimony from figures at the center of President Trump's favorite unsubstantiated theories: the son of former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., a researcher loosely connected to an anti-Trump dossier, a Democratic official and a board member of a Ukrainian energy company.\n\nRather than shy away from conspiracies that Mr. Trump's own government has repeatedly disavowed or played down, the Republicans' requests suggest their willingness to conduct a scorched-earth strategy as they respond to nearly a month of blockbuster revelations about pressure campaigns involving military aid, diplomatic shakedowns and rogue actions by the president's personal lawyer.\n\nMuch of the witness list is certain to be rejected by Democrats leading the impeachment inquiry. But even if Republicans fail to get Mr. Biden's son or the others under oath and in front of cameras, such attention-grabbing tactics by some lawmakers could appeal to Mr. Trump, stoke energy among his most loyal supporters and lend legitimacy to the president's demand that Ukraine investigate many of the same people.\n\nAt the same time, the party is preparing to vigorously contest the Democratic case for impeachment on its own terms, people familiar with the plans said. As public hearings begin next week, members are focused on what they believe are major deficiencies in the evidence already collected.\n\nBuoyed by their growing belief that Democrats have failed to find direct evidence of presidential misconduct, Republicans will insist that the president's critics have gathered in closed-door testimony nothing more damning than secondhand accounts of wrongdoing that fall far short of impeachable offenses.\n\n\"Once again, the Democrats have overstated the case against the president,\" Representative Mark Meadows, Republican of North Carolina, who has listened to hours of private depositions, said in an interview on Saturday. \"They have led with their best witnesses and their best evidence, and it won't stand the test of other evidence and cross-examination.\"\n\nThe Republican optimism is certain to be tested as Democrats marshal the power of their majority to potentially impeach a sitting president for only the third time in the nation's 243-year history. And with many Republican senators vowing to withhold judgment, that confidence may fade if the president faces a trial in the Senate early next year.\n\nDespite claims by the Republicans to the contrary, there is already a mountain of evidence against the president: The reconstructed transcript of a call suggests Mr. Trump pressed his Ukrainian counterpart to begin politically beneficial investigations into the Bidens and an unsubstantiated theory of Democratic collusion in 2016, and thousands of pages of testimony document efforts to hold up military aid and a White House meeting unless Ukraine announced investigations into Mr. Trump's political rivals.\n\nImage\n\"Once again, the Democrats have overstated the case against the president,\" said Representative Mark Meadows, Republican of North Carolina.\n\"Once again, the Democrats have overstated the case against the president,\" said Representative Mark Meadows, Republican of North Carolina.Credit...Erin Schaff/The New York Times\n\nMuch of that testimony has centered on the actions of Rudolph W. Giuliani, the president's personal lawyer, and a handful of Trump loyalists like the ambassador to the European Union, Gordon D. Sondland, who tried to manage Ukraine policy outside the normal diplomatic channels.\n\nDemocrats promise that the public hearings, which begin Wednesday with William B. Taylor Jr., the top American diplomat in Ukraine, will methodically connect those actions to Mr. Trump and lay out the case that he abused the levers of his power for personal political advantage. In recent days, Adam B. Schiff, Democrat of California and the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, said the public would \"learn firsthand about the facts of the president's misconduct.\"\n\nBut after stumbling for weeks toward a coherent response, several people familiar with Republican deliberations said lawmakers were being hypervigilant about guarding against even the hint of a defection in their ranks. Any suggestion of support for impeachment could cause the dam to break, inflicting political damage on them and Mr. Trump, they fear.\n\nThe president's defenders said they planned to do everything they could to sow doubt about the substance of the impeachment allegations, while trying to avoid the temptation to question the motivations and backgrounds of the witnesses called by Democrats \u2014 an approach they believe could backfire. They will leave that to Mr. Trump, who has regularly attacked witnesses on Twitter and in rants to reporters. On Friday, he denigrated the testimony as false  and accused the witnesses of being \"Never Trumpers\" who \"hate President Trump.\"\n\nRepublicans acknowledge that they may not be able to stop Democrats from muscling through articles of impeachment on a party-line basis, but the party leaders believe they can stave off defections in the House and help ensure a speedy acquittal in the Republican-controlled Senate.\n\nThey will be helped by the fact that the burden is on the Democrats to make their case for removing Mr. Trump a year before a presidential election, said Ross H. Garber, one of the nation's leading impeachment lawyers.\n\n\"The Democrats are trying to build a very high Jenga tower and Republicans just have to pull out a couple key pieces and the whole thing comes toppling down,\" Mr. Garber said, referring to the popular game of carefully balanced wooden blocks.\n\nRepresentative Devin Nunes of California, the top Republican on the House Intelligence Committee, is still expected to take the lead in outlining the Republicans' case. But on Friday, Republicans temporarily moved Representative Jim Jordan of Ohio, one of their fiercest questioners, to the committee so that he could participate in grilling the witnesses.\n\nImage\nAdam B. Schiff, Democrat of California and the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee. Under rules adopted by the House, Democrats have the final say on who is called to testify.\nAdam B. Schiff, Democrat of California and the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee.

Volker, the former American special envoy to Ukraine, who they believe could paint Mr. Trump's actions in a more favorable light.\n\nIn a letter to Mr. Schiff, Mr. Nunes anticipated a rejection from Mr. Schiff, writing that \"your failure to fulfill minority witness requests shall constitute evidence of your denial of fundamental fairness and due process.\"\n\nImage\nThe public hearings begin on Wednesday with William B. Taylor Jr., the top American diplomat in Ukraine. \nThe public hearings begin on Wednesday with William B. Taylor Jr., the top American diplomat in Ukraine. Credit...Anna Moneymaker/The New York Times\n\nEvidence of the emerging Republican approach was on display this week in transcripts of the impeachment testimony delivered by the stream of diplomats and national security officials in a secure hearing room in the Capitol basement.\n\nThey indicated that Republicans would portray figures like Mr. Giuliani as working in his own interests, not at Mr. Trump's behest; and that they would argue that Mr. Sondland, a political megadonor with little diplomatic experience, was a braggart who exaggerated his relationship with Mr. Trump and essentially freelanced on his behalf.\n\nThe heart of that effort is the argument that few if any of the witnesses directly heard the president call for a quid pro quo. After Mr. Taylor testified about a September phone call in which he learned that the president wanted Ukraine to investigate his political rivals, Representative Lee Zeldin, Republican of New York, pounced.\n\n\"This isn't firsthand. It's not secondhand. It's not thirdhand,\" Mr. Zeldin said incredulously as he described a game of telephone among Mr. Taylor; Timothy Morrison, a top Russia and Europe expert on the National Security Council; Mr. Sondland; and Mr. Trump about Mr. Zelensky.\n\n\"You're telling us that Tim Morrison told you that Ambassador Sondland told him that the President told Ambassador Sondland that Zelensky would have to open an investigation into Biden?\" Mr. Zeldin asked Mr. Taylor.\n\n\"That's correct,\" Mr. Taylor responded."

But his name is expected to come up during the testimony.\n\nThere's a lot at risk for President Donald Trump and the Republican Party as House Democrats ratchet up their investigation of Trump's demands of Ukrainian officials to turn up damaging information about Democratic rival former Vice President Joe Biden and his son as the administration held up nearly $400 million in military assistance.\n\nDemocrats face risks as well since voters in key swing states have said in opinion polls that they don't support the inquiry.\n\nBut, there's an upside for members of the panel, both for Democrats who are making the case for impeachment and for Republicans who are defending Trump.\n\nThe Democrat\n\n\"This is a chance for the American people to hear for themselves the president's abuse of power,\" Castro told the American-Statesman. The witnesses, he said, will reveal details about Trump's July phone call to the Ukrainian president. They have already testified to House committees behind closed doors and some of the transcripts have been released.\n\n\"It will be a chance to clarify the president's behavior and what's at stake here,\" he said.\n\nAsked if he had already made up his mind, Castro replied, \"I believe we have the evidence to bring articles of impeachment.\" If the House approves articles of impeachment, then the Republican-controlled Senate would hold a trial and decide whether to remove Trump from office \u2014 a remote possibility given public statements from GOP senators.\n\n\"It's an opportunity in the national spotlight,\" Rice University political science professor Mark Jones said. For Castro, who earlier this year decided against a challenge to U.S. John Cornyn, R-Texas, it's a chance \"to reemerge on the national scene and bolster his overall relevance in the Democratic Party,\" Jones said.\n\nCastro is chairman of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus and chairman of his brother Juli\u00e1n Castro's presidential bid.\n\n\"It may raise his profile,\" Brandon Rottinghaus, a University of Houston political science professor, said of Joaquin Castro's role on the stage. He added, \"It may help his brother, who is struggling. It's to their mutual advantage.\" Juli\u00e1n Castro has so far failed to qualify for the November debate.\n\nThe Republicans\n\nOn the Republican side, Hurd could play a pivotal role. He's a former CIA undercover operative who has become known for his occasional critiques of Trump and his policies. Hurd joined all Republican House members in voting against the impeachment inquiry, but he has differed with some Republicans who want to make public the identity of the whistleblower in the Ukraine matter. \"I think we should be protecting the identity of the whistleblower,\" Hurd said on Fox News Sunday.\n\n\"He may well be positioning himself for the post-Trump era,\" Jones said of Hurd. \"It's an opportunity to distance himself from the Trump administration but not be overly pro-Democratic.\"\n\nHurd, 42, said at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin in September that he would consider running for president in 2024, in certain circumstances. \"This could be a real chance to introduce himself to a national audience and set the stage for future runs for office,\" Rottinghaus said.\n\nRatcliffe, a former prosecutor, already took a turn in the spotlight in the summer with his aggressive questioning of Special Counsel Robert Mueller during a public hearing. That brought him to Trump's attention who tapped Ratcliffe to be the new director of national intelligence \u2014 an announcement that backfired with a backlash against Ratcliffe's thin national security credentials and embellishment of his r\u00e9sum\u00e9.\n\nConaway, a former business associate of former President George W. Bush, was first elected in 2004. He also took on a high profile turn as chairman of the intelligence panel on an interim basis in 2017 when the GOP was in control of the House.\n\nAt a Nov. 6 town hall meeting in Midland, Conaway said he didn't think Trump had done anything to warrant impeachment and called the inquiry \"nauseating,\" according to the Midland Reporter-Telegram."

        "title": "After push from Perry, backers got huge gas deal in Ukraine",
        "text": "Two political supporters of U.S. Energy Secretary Rick Perry secured a potentially lucrative oil and gas exploration deal from the Ukrainian government soon after Perry proposed one of the men as an adviser to the country's new president.\n\nPerry's efforts to influence Ukraine's energy policy came earlier this year, just as President Volodymyr Zelenskiy's new government was seeking military aid from the United States to defend against Russian aggression and allies of President Donald Trump were ramping up efforts to get the Ukrainians to investigate his Democratic rival Joe Biden.\n\nUkraine awarded the contract to Perry's supporters little more than a month after the U.S. energy secretary attended Zelenskiy's May inauguration. In a meeting during that trip, Perry handed the new president a list of people he recommended as energy advisers. One of the four names was his longtime political backer Michael Bleyzer.\n\nA week later, Bleyzer and his partner Alex Cranberg submitted a bid to drill for oil and gas at a sprawling government-controlled site called Varvynska. Their proposal was millions of dollars lower than their only competitor, according to internal Ukrainian government documents obtained by The Associated Press. But their newly created joint venture, Ukrainian Energy, was awarded the 50-year contract because a government-appointed commission determined they had greater technical expertise and stronger financial backing, the documents show.\n\nPerry likely had outsized influence in Ukraine. Testimony in the impeachment inquiry into Trump shows the energy secretary was one of three key U.S. officials who were negotiating a meeting between Trump and the Ukrainian leader.\n\nThe sequence of events suggests the Trump administration's political maneuvering in Ukraine was entwined with the big business of the energy trade.\n\nPerry made clear during trips to Kyiv that he was close to Bleyzer, a Ukrainian-American investor and longtime Perry supporter who lives in Houston, and Cranberg, a Republican mega-donor who provided Perry the use of a luxury corporate jet during the energy secretary's failed 2012 presidential bid.\n\nPerry's spokeswoman said Wednesday that the energy secretary has championed the American energy industry all over the world, including in Ukraine.\n\n\"What he did not do is advocate for the business interests of any one individual or company,\" said Shaylyn Hynes, the press secretary for the Energy Department.\n\nJessica Tillipman, who teaches anti-corruption law at George Washington University, said even if Perry did seek to influence foreign officials to award contracts to his friends, it is likely not illegal.\n\n\"My gut says it's no crime,\" she said. \"It's just icky.\"\n\nZelenskiy's office did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nIn a statement to AP, Bleyzer denied that Perry helped his firm get the gas deal.\n\n\"I believe that Secretary Perry's conversations with Ukrainian government officials, if they in fact took place, did not play any role in Ukrainian Energy winning its bid,\" Bleyzer said Tuesday. He said the process was competitive and transparent and \"will hopefully serve as an example of how the Ukrainian energy market can be opened for new investments.\"\n\nAmy Flakne, a lawyer for Cranberg's company Aspect Holdings, said Wednesday that Perry and other U.S. officials supported \"a fair, competitive process to bring foreign capital and technology to Ukraine's lagging energy sector.\"\n\n\"Aspect neither sought, nor to our knowledge received, special intervention on its behalf,\" Flakne said.\n\n\u2018Freedom gas'\nAs Trump's energy secretary, Perry has flown around the globe to push for U.S. exports of liquefied natural gas, which he calls \"Freedom Gas.\" He's made multiple trips to Ukraine and other former Soviet-bloc nations, where shipments of American gas and drilling technology take on strategic importance as a potential alternative to continued dependence on imports from Russia.\n\nUkraine has long suffered from a reputation for political corruption, particularly in its oil and gas sector. In the chaotic days following the breakup of the Soviet Union, the newly independent Ukrainian government sold off many state-owned businesses worth billions to a cadre of well-connected oligarchs who amassed immense fortunes.\n\nAs Ukraine sought economic and security support from the U.S. and other Western democracies, those countries pressed it to put in place a more open and transparent process for awarding oil and gas exploration rights on state land.\n\nAt the urging of Western partners, Ukraine's government created a process requiring that exploration contracts be put out to bid and awarded following review from a selection board appointed by the president's cabinet of ministers. The board recommends the winners, pending final approval from the ministers.\n\nThose Western partners also advised Ukraine to appoint an independent supervisory board at Naftogaz, the state-owned energy company, as a guard against corruption and self-dealing.\n\nWATCH: How Mick Mulvaney plays into the Ukraine impeachment inquiry saga\n\nIn February, the Ukrainian government opened up bidding for nine oil and gas blocks encompassing 4,428 square miles (11,469 square kilometers) of land. Ukrainian Energy, the joint venture between Bleyzer's investment firm SigmaBleyzer and Cranberg's Aspect Energy, submitted a single bid for the largest block, which covers 1,340 square miles (3,471 square kilometers).\n\nUnder the contracts, the winning bidder is awarded exclusive rights to extract petroleum for up to 50 years. After the initial costs are recovered, the company and the government split the profits.\n\nAn internal review of the proposals by the Ukrainian Ministry of Energy and Coal Mining obtained by the AP show they were not the highest bidder.\n\nThe only competing bidder, UkrGasVydobuvannya, known by the acronym UGV, offered more than $60 million for the first phase of the project, compared with $53 million from Bleyzer and Cranberg, the document shows. UGV is Ukraine's largest domestic gas producer and is a subsidiary of Naftogaz, the state-owned company where Perry sought to replace board members.\n\nDespite the lower upfront investment, the selection board gave the Americans higher scores for technical expertise and overall financial resources, according to the document reviewed by AP.\n\nOf the nine gas deals awarded on July 1, Bleyzer and Cranberg's bid was the only one of the winners that didn't include the participation of a Ukrainian company. UGV won four of the remaining bids.\n\nTwo members of the board that helped select the bid winners told AP that the process is designed to be hard to improperly influence because it is a mix of government representatives and industry experts.\n\nRoman Opimakh, a commission member who is the head of the State Service of Geology and Subsoil of Ukraine, said the government was looking for foreign investment, particularly U.S., and the board considered that as a factor. He said it's an advantage if a company is well-connected in?Washington but?added?that he saw no indication that U.S. officials influenced the process.\n\nPerry, who served 14 years as the governor of Texas, has publicly championed the potential of U.S. hydraulic fracturing technology to boost oil and gas production in Ukraine?and pressed for the bidding process to be opened up to U.S. companies.\n\nAt an energy industry roundtable in Kyiv in November 2018, Perry said the potential for oil and gas development in Ukraine is \"staggering.\" Ukraine, he declared, had a chance to become \"the Texas of Europe.\"\n\nAt the same event, which was co-sponsored by the nonprofit U.S.-Ukraine Business Council, Perry plugged Cranberg's expertise. Both Cranberg and Bleyzer were in the room, along with several American and Ukrainian energy industry officials.\n\n\"You know, Alex Cranberg, who has been in this business a long time, can attest to this probably as well as anyone sitting around the table, that we have the potential to change the world,\" Perry said, according to a transcript released by the U.S. Embassy in Kyiv.\n\nDuring the same 2018 trip, Perry had a private meeting with then-Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko, where they discussed deepening the ties between the two country's energy industries, according to a U.S. Embassy summary of the meeting\n\nRecords suggest Perry has also met regularly with Bleyzer. Visitor logs released by the Energy Department through a public records request show Bleyzer entering through the VIP check-in desk at the building where Perry's office is at least three times, most recently on May 8.\n\nLess than two weeks later, Perry was on a plane to Kyiv to attend the inauguration ceremony for Zelenskiy, who had defeated Poroshenko in an April election. It was during that trip that Perry presented his list of recommended advisers that included Bleyzer and remarked on their long friendship, according to a person in the room who spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of retaliation. Attendees left the meeting with the impression that Perry wanted to replace an American representative on the Naftogaz board with someone \"reputable in Republican circles,\" according to the person who was there.\n\nBleyzer said Tuesday that he had been included in what he described as a brainstorming session with Energy Department officials about creating an informal group knowledgeable about Ukraine's energy industry to help develop U.S. strategy, but he had no idea his name would be forwarded to the country's new president.\n\n\"I was not aware at any time that my name was recommended by Secretary Perry to the Ukrainian government to act in any capacity,\" Bleyzer said.\n\nPerry's work in Ukraine places him at the center of the House impeachment inquiry into efforts by Trump and his personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani to press Zelenskiy to open an investigation into Biden and his son Hunter's business dealings with Burisma, another Ukrainian gas company.\n\nPerry, who announced last month that he is resigning by the end of the year, has refused to cooperate with the congressional probe. In an Oct. 4 interview with the Christian Broadcasting Network, Perry said that \"as God as my witness\" he never discussed Biden or his son in meetings with Ukrainian or U.S. officials.\n\nBut Perry was at the White House for a key July 10 meeting where senior Ukrainian officials were told continued U.S. support was conditional on Zelenskiy's government opening investigations into Democrats and Burisma, Army Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman, an aide on Trump's National Security Council, testified last month.\n\nTexas ties\nBleyzer and Perry's ties go back at least a decade. As governor, Perry appointed Bleyzer in 2009 to serve as?a member of a Texas state advisory board overseeing state funding to emerging technology ventures. The following year, Bleyzer contributed $30,000 to Perry's 2010 campaign for Texas governor.\n\nThe Ukrainian-born Texan cuts a flamboyant figure in the energy world. A 2012 profile in the Houston Chronicle is set in his modernist 15,000-square-foot mansion. In an accompanying photo, he stands next to his wife, a mane of gray hair to his shoulders, on a balcony overlooking a swimming pool.\n\nA former engineer at Exxon, Bleyzer was born in Ukraine's Kharkiv region and trained in digital electronics and quantum physics. In 1994, he founded SigmaBleyzer Investment group, a private equity firm that specializes in developing corporate stakes in Eastern Europe. The company says it manages about $1 billion in assets.\n\nBleyzer also has ties to Giuliani. In 2008, Bleyzer's company hired Giuliani's former Houston-based law firm, Bracewell & Giuliani, to help it acquire and consolidate cable holdings in 16 Ukrainian cities, including Kyiv, according to an announcement at the time. The same year, Bleyzer donated $2,300 to Giuliani's presidential campaign.\n\nBleyzer's company is the primary funder of the U.S.-Ukraine Business Council, which promotes the interests of American businesses operating in Ukraine. According to tax records, the business council is run out of the Washington, D.C, offices of its president and CEO, Morgan Williams, who is also listed as the government affairs director for SigmaBleyzer.\n\nThe council, which sponsors events that feature senior U.S. and Ukrainian government officials, pushes for policy priorities that dovetail with Bleyzer's business interests \u2014 including lobbying to create the very process that opened Ukraine's state-controlled oil and gas fields to foreign investment, according to the webpage of the state geology service.\n\nDays after the government in Ukraine posted the gas blocks for bidding in February, visitor logs show Williams accompanied Bleyzer through the VIP entrance at the Energy Department.\n\nOn May 28, the day the bids were due in Kyiv, Williams again accompanied Bleyzer, who photos show was sporting a Western-style shirt with a Stars and Stripes pattern, to the offices of Ukraine's energy ministry to submit their company's bid.\n\nOn June 5 \u2014 while Bleyzer and Cranberg's proposal was under review \u2014 Williams met with a key Zelenskiy adviser, Oleg Ustenko, and told him that significant expansion of oil and gas production in Ukraine could only be achieved with investments from private companies, including ones from the United States, according to a summary of the meeting posted on the business council's website.\n\nIn an apparent dig at the company competing against Bleyzer and Cranberg for the gas deal, Williams also told Ustenko that the \"participation of the state monopoly player\" undermined the chances of private companies to win, according to the summary.\n\nWhat the council's media release failed to mention is that, like Williams, Ustenko serves dual roles. In addition to advising the Ukrainian president, the economist is the longtime executive director of The Bleyzer Foundation, a Kyiv-based nonprofit organization founded by Bleyzer in 2001. The group's website describes its mission as promoting private-sector investment in Ukraine.\n\nLess than four weeks later, Ukraine Energy was named the winner of the Varvynska block over the Naftogaz subsidiary.\n\nBleyzer would not say whether he considered it a conflict for his employee to simultaneously be leading the international trade group while also advocating for his private business interests.\n\nHe said the U.S.-Ukraine Business Council is just one of many organizations that strongly support the participation of foreign companies in the bidding process \"as one of the key factors in helping Ukraine achieve its energy independence from Russia.\"\n\nAs with Bleyzer, Cranberg also has longtime ties to Perry.\n\nA graduate of the University of Texas in Austin, Cranberg was appointed by Perry in 2011 to serve a six-year term on the state university system's board of regents. He is a generous political donor, giving more than $3 million since the mid-1980s primarily to Republican candidates and fundraising committees, according to federal and state campaign finance records.\n\nIn the last 13 months, Cranberg has contributed just over $650,000 to two committees focused on electing Republicans to House seats, $637,000 to the National Republican Senatorial Committee and $258,000 to the National Republican Congressional Committee. He and his wife each gave $50,000 last April to Trump Victory, the joint entity that funds the president's reelection campaign and the Republican National Committee.\n\nWhen Perry campaigned for president in 2011, federal disclosures show his campaign paid more than $16,000 to a holding company for a private jet used by Cranberg.\n\nCranberg is also among those who entered through the VIP desk at the Energy Department, logging in with his wife for a visit in April 2018.\n\nHis company last year hired Perry's former campaign manager, Jeff Miller, as a lobbyist. Miller has been to the Energy Department's headquarters at least a dozen times since Perry became secretary, according to the visitor logs. He mostly signed in through the VIP entrance."

        "text": "A rough transcript of a congratulatory phone call President Donald Trump made this spring to Ukraine's president-elect contained no mention of corruption, despite the White House shortly after the call saying Trump had broached the subject.\n\nThe White House on Friday released the rough transcript of the call Trump made to Volodymyr Zelenskiy on April 21, after the latter had won Ukraine's presidential election. In September, the White House released a rough transcript of a second call between the two leaders -- on July 25 -- that has played a central role in the House impeachment inquiry into Trump's behavior.\n\nA readout of the April call that the White House provided at the time said the president \"expressed his commitment to work together with President-elect Zelenskyy (sic) and the Ukrainian people to implement reforms that strengthen democracy, increase prosperity, and root out corruption.\"\n\nBut the rough transcript was devoid of any discussion of policy matters. Rather, much of the call consisted of Trump praising Zelenskiy's campaign after the Ukrainian compared his own election to that of Trump's.\n\nTrump did not raise the issue of corruption on the call despite a recommendation from the National Security Council that he do so and NSC talking points he received on the topic, according to a person familiar with the call and preparations for the conversation.\n\nThe official readout shared with the press was drafted in advance of the phone call and based on talking points and briefing materials Trump received and did not follow, the person said.\n\nThe draft statements, which are prepared by the NSC legal and press teams and approved by the National Security Advisor, are typically updated to reflect the conversations.\n\nLt. Col. Alexander Vindman, a National Security Council staffer who listened in on both of the president's calls with Zelenskiy, has already testified to House investigators behind closed doors that there was nothing out of the ordinary with the April call.\n\n\"The April 21st call is notable in my mind because it was actually a very good call. It was exactly what we had -- we were hoping for,\" Vindman said. \"It was just -- everybody was happy, high-fiving from that call because we were moving in the right direction for Ukraine.\"\n\nThe Ukrainian president-elect invited Trump to his inauguration, while at the same time, Trump mentioned a White House visit.\n\n\"When you're settled in and ready, I'd like to invite you to the White House,\" Trump said during the roughly 16-minute call he made from Air Force One. \"We'll have a lot of things to talk about, but we're with you all the way.\"\n\nThe document released by the White House is called a \"memorandum of a telephone conversation,\" and the first page notes that it \"is not a verbatim transcript of a discussion,\" but rather a recording of the notes and recollections of\" officials who were \"assigned to listen and memorialize the conversation in written form as the conversation takes place.\"\n\nMinutes after the White House released the memo, the ranking member of the House Intelligence Committee, California Rep. Devin Nunes, read it aloud during a hearing with the former ambassador to Ukraine, Marie Yovanovitch, as part of the House's public impeachment inquiry proceedings. White House Press Secretary Stephanie Grisham said that Trump planned to watch Nunes deliver his opening statement.\n\nGrisham told ABC News nothing had been redacted or otherwise not included.\n\n\"As you can see if you look at it \u2013 it is the full transcript,\" she said.\n\nofficially announced it four days after the call."

        "title": "How Republican Defenses of Trump on Impeachment Have Shifted Over Time",
        "text": "The Democratic allegations at the heart of the ongoing impeachment inquiry are pretty simple: that Donald Trump used the power of the presidency to pressure a foreign government to improperly investigate Joe Biden. Or as Democrat Eric Swalwell of California summarized it on Nov. 7, \"Defense dollars for dirt.\"\n\nThe Republican response, by contrast, has been less straightforward. In the weeks since Sept. 24, when the White House released a rough transcript of Trump's July 25 call with Ukrainian president Volodomyr Zelensky, the Republican defense has shifted dramatically, from denying the charges and then dismissing that they would be impeachable if true, to denigrating witnesses and evidence and attacking the impeachment process.\n\nDemocrats paint the changing defense as evidence of its weakness. Republicans attribute it to another source: disorganization. So far, they say, there's been little coordination between the White House and Trump's nominal allies on the Hill about a messaging strategy.\n\nBut the GOP tried to institute some order before the first day of public testimony in the House's impeachment hearings, circulating a memo from staff to Republican committee members the day before\u2014 which was obtained by TIME\u2014 outlining \"four key pieces of evidence\" that they believe are \"fatal to the Democrats' allegations.\"\n\nHere's a look at how the defense of Donald Trump has changed since the impeachment proceedings began.\n\n\u2018No Quid Pro Quo'\nSince the moment he authorized the release of a transcript, Trump has maintained there was no quid pro quo in his withholding military aid from Ukraine while pushing the country to investigate Joe and Hunter Biden. In a tweet announcing the decision to publish the call, Trump said his conversation with President Zelensky was \"totally appropriate,\" that he applied \"no pressure,\" and that there was \"NO quid pro quo.\"\n\nTrump has continued to chant this mantra at rallies, on Twitter and in interviews \u2014 a blanket defense of the core issue at the center of Democrats' investigation. And it has been echoed by other top members of his Administration. \"The transcript of the President's phone call with President Zelensky\u2026 there was no quid pro quo,\" Vice President Mike Pence said on Oct. 3. \"There was no pressure.\" Kellyanne Conway, counselor to the president, Larry Kudlow, Trump's chief economic advisor, Steve Mnuchin, Treasury secretary, and others of Trump's top allies have all repeated this line as well.\n\nBut this stance has become more complicated in recent days as witnesses have asserted explicitly to House investigators that there was, in fact, a quid pro quo.\n\n\"That was my clear understanding,\" William Taylor, the top U.S. diplomat in Ukraine, testified last month. \"Security assistance money would not come until the president [of Ukraine] committed to pursue the investigation,\" Taylor continued, according to the transcript of his testimony. Taylor reaffirmed this in public testimony on Nov. 13. \"[Gordon Sondland] described conditions for the security assistance and the White House meeting in those terms,\" Taylor said. \"That is, they were dependent upon\u2014 conditioned upon\u2014 pursuing these investigations.\"\n\nOn Nov. 5, Sondland, the U.S. Ambassador to the European Union, revised his original testimony to include that he had passed along such a message to a Zelensky advisor. \"I said that resumption of the U.S. aid would likely not occur until Ukraine provided the public anticorruption statement that we had been discussing for many weeks,\" Sondland said in a written statement.\n\nSome Trump aides adjusted their strategy, and been backing away from an unequivocal \"no quid pro quo\" defense.\n\nOn Nov. 3, for example, Conway changed her tune on CNN. She continued to say there was no quid pro quo, but then when pressed by CNN's Dana Bash, Conway said, \"I don't know whether aid was being held up and for how long.\"\n\nAttacking the process\nWhen Pelosi announced the start of a formal impeachment inquiry on Sept. 24, Republicans immediately began decrying the process and questioning the legitimacy of the investigation. In past impeachments, the inquiries had been voted on by the full House, whereas in this case, Pelosi didn't hold a vote to begin it. While that broke with tradition, there is nothing in the Constitution that says the House needs a vote to begin an impeachment investigation. But Republicans and White House lawyers seized on the procedural omission to defend Trump nonetheless. As the investigation has proceeded, they've also criticized the fact that many of the hearings have been held behind closed doors.\n\n\"This is a process problem,\" Rep. Mark Meadows, an ally of the President and leader of the Freedom Caucus, told TIME in late October. \"If you focus on communication and not process, you're focusing on the wrong thing.\"\n\nOn Oct. 8, White House Counsel Pat Cipollone sent a letter to House Democratic leaders in which he said they \"have designed and implemented your inquiry in a manner that violates fundamental fairness and constitutionally mandated due process,\" specifically citing the lack of a House vote to authorize it. He announced that Trump and his Administration would not cooperate with the investigation.\n\n\"We think there's serious constitutional flaws [with] the way the process is going on,\" Trump's personal attorney Jay Sekulow told TIME on Oct. 22.\n\nSenate Judiciary Chairman Lindsey Graham introduced a resolution in October condemning the inquiry, arguing that Democrats are \"abandoning more than a century's worth of precedent and tradition in impeachment proceedings and denying President Trump basic fairness and due process accorded every American.\" Graham and other Republicans have complained both about the lack of a full House vote to begin the probe and that the testimony has thus far largely not been public.\n\nOn Oct. 31, the House did vote on formalizing the inquiry, and public hearings are set to start next week. While he often refers to the impeachment investigation as a \"witch hunt\" \u2014 the same term he used to describe Robert Mueller's investigation \u2014 Trump has urged Republicans to move away from process arguments as the inquiry has proceeded. \"I'd rather go into the details of the case rather than process,\" Trump told reporters on Oct. 28 of how Republicans in Congress were defending him. \"Process is good, but I think you ought to look at the case, and the case is very simple and quick.\"\n\nUndermining the credibility of witnesses\nTrump and his allies have attempted to undermine the credibility of certain witnesses and poke holes in their testimony. Trump has repeatedly attacked the whistleblower whose complaint spurred the impeachment inquiry, calling for the person's identity to be revealed and criticizing the media for not publishing it. He has also asserted, without evidence, that the whistleblower has a political agenda.\n\n\"There have have been stories written about a certain individual, a male, and they say he's the whistleblower,\" Trump told reporters on Nov. 3. \"If he's the whistleblower, he has no credibility because he's a Brennan guy, he's a Susan Rice guy, he's an Obama guy. And he hates Trump.\"\n\nAfter Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman, a National Security Council official, testified behind closed doors on Oct. 29, Trump tweeted that he was a \"Never Trumper witness.\" On Nov. 2, when asked whether he regrets that comment, Trump seemed to imply he had damaging information to release about Vindman: \"Well, you'll be seeing very soon what comes out and then you can ask the question in a different way,\" Trump said.\n\nAs members of conservative media amplified Trump's attacks on Vindman, who was born in Ukraine, and questioned his patriotism, some Republicans in Congress condemned the line of attack. \"I'm not going to question the patriotism of any of the people who are coming forward,\" Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said the day of Vindman's testimony. House Republican Conference Chairwoman Liz Cheney said questioning Vindman's patriotism was \"shameful.\"\n\nSondland, on the other hand, is a Trump donor, and can't be criticized as a \"Never Trumper.\" When he updated his testimony in a statement that said he had been the messenger of a quid pro quo, White House press secretary Stephanie Grisham released a statement saying, in part, \"Ambassador Sondland squarely states that he \u2018did not know, (and still does not know) when, why or by whom the aid was suspended.' He also said he \u2018presumed' there was a link to the aid \u2014 but cannot identify any solid source for that assumption.\"\n\nThere may have been a quid pro quo, but that's not impeachable\nOn Oct. 17, acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney held a press conference in which he dramatically changed the defense of Trump's actions, and then walked back his comments hours later. While Trump had been continuing to proclaim \"no quid pro quo,\" while standing behind the podium in the White House press briefing room, Mulvaney seemed to acknowledge that there had been one \u2014 but that it wasn't a problem. \"Did he also mention to me in [the] past the corruption related to the DNC server? Absolutely,\" Mulvaney said of a conversation he had with Trump. \"No question about that. But that's it, and that's why we held up the money.\"\n\n\"I have news for everybody: Get over it,\" Mulvaney said. \"There's going to be political influence in foreign policy.\"\n\nReaction to what seemed to be the first acknowledgement of a quid pro quo in the conversation at the heart of the impeachment inquiry was swift, and hours later, Mulvaney put out a statement disputing his earlier comments. \"There was absolutely no quid pro quo between Ukrainian military aid and any investigation into the 2016 election,\" he said in his later statement.\n\nWhile he had to walk back his explanation of why Trump held up aid money to Ukraine, others are now shifting to a defense of Trump that mirrors Mulvaney's original comments: that there may have been a quid pro quo, but that's not an impeachable offense.\n\nThis line of defense has emerged as multiple witnesses (including Sondland and Taylor) have testified about the occurrence of a quid pro quo. \"If it was a condition of getting aid that there be an investigation into a political rival, that was inappropriate,\" the top Republican on the House Armed Services Committee, Mac Thornberry of Texas, told NPR on Oct. 28. \"Whether it rises to the standard of being an impeachable offense \u2014 that's a different question.\"\n\n\"The Senate will face the question of whether that's an impeachable offense,\" Sen. Roger Wicker, a Republican from Mississippi, told CNN in November. \"And I don't think the American people are going to conclude that it is.\"\n\nTrump is no fan of this tactic, however, as he still maintains that there was no quid pro quo at the base of the matter. \"False stories are being reported that a few Republican Senators are saying that President Trump may have done a quid pro quo, but it doesn't matter, there is nothing wrong with that, it is not an impeachable event,\" the President tweeted on Nov. 4. \"Perhaps so, but read the transcript, there is no quid pro quo!\"\n\nUkraine is out to get Trump\nTrump has maintained that his interest in Ukraine had to do with rooting out corruption in the country, and has espoused a conspiracy theory that the nation colluded with Hillary Clinton in 2016 by by hiding the Democratic National Committee's email server and disseminating dirt about Trump. \"He's always looking for corruption, which is what more people should be doing,\" Trump said in response to a question from TIME on Oct. 28 about his lawyer Rudy Giuliani, who Trump invoked on the July 25 call with Zelensky.\n\nRead more: How Trump's Obsession With a Conspiracy Theory Led to the Impeachment Crisis\n\nThe memo and questioning by the Intelligence Committee Republican counsel Steve Castor during public testimony on Nov. 13 pushed this idea that Trump is justified in his worries about Ukraine and that the country has worked to oppose him.\n\nWhile questioning witnesses George Kent and Taylor, Castor referred to \"elements of the Ukrainian establishment that were out to get the president,\" and tried to get Taylor to agree that is a \"reasonable\" thing for Trump to believe.\n\n\"President Trump's concerns about Ukraine's role in the 2016 election. You believe he genuinely believed they were working against him, right?\" Castor asked. Taylor responded he did not know.\n\nThe memo circulated the previous day encouraged Republican members to highlight Trump's \"deep-seated, genuine, and reasonable skepticism about Ukraine due to its history of pervasive corruption\" and claims that \"senior Ukrainian government officials interfered in the 2016 U.S. presidential election in opposition to President Trump.\"\n\nThis line of argument works to add a justification for Trump's interest in Ukraine and minimize the idea that he was simply looking for his own political benefit from the suggested investigations.\n\nPublic hearings: All of the above\nRepublicans prepared and previewed their main points before the first public hearings in the impeachment probe on Nov. 13 in a memo that had been sent around the previous day. This memo urged the Republican questioners to focus on four points that could undermine the idea that Trump engaged in an impeachable offense: the July 25 call summary \"shows no conditionality or evidence of pressure,\" both Trump and Zelensky have said there was no pressure on the call, the Ukrainian government was not aware that the security assistance had been held up at the time of the July 25 call, and the two presidents met and aid was resumed in September without an announcement that Ukraine would investigate the Bidens, according to the memo.\n\nThe substance of this memo is evidently aimed to bolster the original \"no quid pro quo\" defense, by establishing that there was no pressure on Ukraine to investigate the Bidens and that the delayed assistance was not conditioned upon that.\n\nDuring his time to speak before witnesses Kent and Taylor, Rep. Devin Nunes of California, the ranking member of the committee, ticked through the basic ideas outlined in the memo. \"We're supposed to believe that President Trump committed a terrible crime that never actually occurred, and which the supposed victim denies ever happened,\" he said. Rep. Jim Jordan of Ohio questioned Taylor about three meetings he attended with Zelensky during which the Ukrainian president did not mention the investigations that Taylor understood to be linked to the security assistance. Rep. John Ratcliffe of Texas read numerous quotes by Zelensky saying he didn't feel pressure from Trump. \"The Ukrainian President stood in front of the world press and repeatedly, consistently, over and over again, interview after interview, said he had no knowledge of military aid being withheld,\" Ratcliffe said. \"Meaning no quid pro quo, no pressure, no demands, no threats, no blackmail. Nothing corrupt.\"\n\nRep. Elise Stefanik of New York succinctly summarized the main elements of the GOP defense: \"For the millions of Americans viewing today, the two most important facts are the following,\" she said. \"Number one: Ukraine received the aid. Number two: there was in fact no investigation into Biden.\"\n\nBut not all of the Republicans on the committee stuck to the key points from the memo, and some continued with previous lines of defense. During his opening statement, Nunes also continued criticizing the process of the impeachment inquiry and calling into question the credibility of the whistleblower and witnesses. During his opening statement, Nunes called the impeachment investigation a \"horrifically one-sided process\" and said it is \"an impeachment process in search of a crime.\" He also claimed the whistleblower has \"a bias against President Trump,\" and dismissed \"officials' alarm at the President's actions\" as \"typically based on second-hand, third-hand, and even fourth-hand rumors and innuendo.\"\n\nRep. Mike Turner of Ohio used all of his questioning to highlight out that neither Kent nor Taylor has ever had direct contact with Trump, attempting to diminish their value as witnesses. \"The man that neither one of you have had any contact with, you're the first up witnesses,\" Turner said. \"I just find that a little amazing.\""

        "text": "Multiple Fox News personalities speculated that President Trump's insulting tweet toward former U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine could result in witness tampering and witness intimidation charges.\n\nThe president denigrated the former ambassador while she was testifying in front of the House Intelligence Committee on Friday morning. While she was on Capitol Hill, Trump tweeted that, \"Everywhere Marie Yovanovitch went turned bad. She started off in Somalia, how did that go?\" He also pointed out that administration officials serve at the pleasure of the president.\n\nHouse Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff read the tweet aloud during the hearing and asked Yovanovitch to respond to it.\n\n\"I mean, I \u2014 I don't think I have such powers, not in Mogadishu and Somalia and not in other places,\" she answered. \"I actually think that where I've served over the years, I and others have demonstrably made things better, you know, for the U.S. as well as for the countries that I've served in.\"\n\nSchiff then warned the president that, \"some of us here take witness intimidation very, very seriously.\"\n\nA number of Fox News personalities were quick to point out that the president's tweet could ultimately prove to be ill-advised during the first extended break in her testimony.\n\nBret Baier tweeted, \"That was a turning point in this hearing so far. She was already a sympathetic witness & the President's tweet ripping her allowed Schiff to point it out real time characterizing it as witness tampering or intimidation -adding an article of impeachment real-time.\"\n\nChris Wallace echoed that sentiment on-air, \"Most importantly, and I agree with Bret [Baier] here, I think that the really dramatic moment is that this wasn't just testimony about the past, this played out in real-time with the president attacking her and saying that every place she served went back, and she was asked by Adam Schiff, do you see that as an effort to intimidate you and other witnesses, and she said 'I feel that is quite intimidating.' And that does raise the possibility of witness intimidation and witness tampering as a new charge here.\"\n\nSenior White House correspondent John Roberts, reporting from outside the White House, also said that \"What we may have just seen, as has been mentioned unfold in real-time there, is the potential basis for articles of impeachment on witness intimidation. I'm not sure that the president's tweet that he sent out while she was on the stand was particularly well advised.\""

I think he'd be, he'd be railing against what's going on.\"\n\nWhen the senator was alive, she argued, he made it possible for other GOP lawmakers to stand up to Trump rather than having to stay in line for fear of losing support back home.\n\n\"I think John provided a lot of cover for other members, and when he would do it, they could get behind him,\" she said. \"I'm not seeing a real rudder in the Senate right now in all this.\"\n\nJohn McCain died at age 81 in 2018 after a battle with brain cancer. Though a staunch critic of Trump, the so-called maverick was known for his friendships on both sides of the aisle, and was often able to overcome partisanship in an effort to get things done. At times, that included breaking with his own party, a seemingly unthinkable act for today's GOP hardliners.\n\nIn August \u2015 weeks before Democrats launched their impeachment probe \u2015 Cindy McCain told CNN that before her husband died, he expressed that \"he was very frustrated with what was going on,\" regarding the overall division in Washington.\n\nIn her latest interview, she took issue with Trump's effort to push unsubstantiated corruption allegations against Joe Biden and his son, calling the former vice president a \"lovely man\" and saying that it's unnecessary \"to disparage anyone that's running just because you disagree with them.\"\n\nTrump's attempt to malign Biden, who is running for the Democratic presidential nomination, has become central to impeachment proceedings as Trump pressed Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in July to launch an investigation into the Bidens. Meanwhile, American military aid to the country was being withheld, raising concerns of a quid pro quo.\n\nHowever, Trump and his Republican allies have vehemently denied any shady dealings.\n\nWhile Cindy McCain sympathized with politicians' concerns about getting reelected if they go against Trump, \"at some point, you have to do what you were elected to do and that is represent the country as well as your local people,\" she said.\n\n\"I know he would be terribly upset by this whole thing,\" she added, referring to her husband. \"He was upset before he died, he saw what was going on. ...

Witnesses said Bolton was highly critical of the effort and that he said he wanted nothing to do with what he characterized as a \"drug deal.\" \n\nHe declined a request to testify in the impeachment inquiry and his lawyer told congressional Democrats he would fight a subpoena. But his attorney, Charles Cooper, also teased that Bolton was \"personally involved in many of the events, meetings, and conversations about which you have already received testimony\" and suggested that he could speak about \"many relevant meetings and conversations that have not yet been discussed in the testimonies thus far.\" \n\nDemocrats have said they will not issue a subpoena for Bolton because of the time it would take to resolve a court battle. \n\n\"Fox News Sunday\" host Chris Wallace asked Rep.

But Bolton is a staunch Republican who might be reluctant to hand Democrats political ammunition. \n\n\"Frankly, I don't think anybody knows, except John Bolton, exactly what role he wants to play in this drama,\" said Aaron David Miller, a senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. \n\nContributing: Bart Jansen and Deirdre Shesgreen"

        "text": "President Trump signed an executive order Monday on price transparency in health care that aims to lower rising health care costs by showing prices to patients. The idea is that if people can shop around, market forces may drive down costs.\n\n\"Hospitals will be required to publish prices that reflect what people pay for services,\" said President Trump at a White House event. \"You will get great pricing. Prices will come down by numbers that you wouldn't believe. The cost of healthcare will go way, way down.\"\n\nLike several of President Trump's other health policy-related announcements, today's executive order doesn't spell out specific actions, but directs the department of Health and Human Services to develop a policy and then undertake a lengthy rule-making process.\n\n\"The president knows the best way to lower costs in health care is to put patients in control by increasing choice and competition,\" HHS Secretary Alex Azar said at a phone briefing for reporters Monday morning.\n\nAzar outlined five parts of the executive order, two of which are directly related to price transparency.\n\nIt directs the agency to draft a new rule that would require hospitals to disclose the prices that patients and insurers actually pay in \"an easy-to-read, patient-friendly format,\" Azar said.\n\nThe new rule should also \"require health care providers and insurers to provide patients with information about the out-of-pocket costs they'll face before they receive health care services,\" he added.\n\nThe idea is simple. Health care is an industry where consumers don't have access to the kind of information they have when making other purchasing decisions. The executive order could \u2014 if it leads to finalized, HHS rules \u2014 pressure the industry to function more like a normal market, where quality and price drive consumer behavior. Some consumer advocates welcomed the move.\n\n\"Today patients don't have access to prices or choices or even ability to see quality,\" said Cynthia Fisher, founder of a group called Patient Rights Advocate. \"I think the exciting part of this executive order is the President and administration are really moving to put the patient in the driver's seat and be empowered for the first time with knowledge and information.\"\n\nExactly how the rules the executive order calls for would work is still to be determined, administration officials said.\n\nPush back from various corners of the healthcare industry came quickly, with hospital and health plan lobbying organizations arguing this transparency requirement would have the unintended consequence of pushing prices up, rather than down.\n\n\"Publicly disclosing competitively negotiated, proprietary rates will reduce competition and push prices higher \u2014 not lower \u2014 for consumers, patients, and taxpayers,\" said Matt Eyles, CEO of America's Health Insurance Plans in a statement. He says it will perpetuate \"the old days of the American health care system paying for volume over value. We know that is a formula for higher costs and worse care for everyone.\"\n\nSome health economists and industry observers without a vested interest expressed a similar view. Larry Levitt, senior vice president for health reform the Kaiser Family Foundation, tweeted that although the idea of greater price transparency makes sense from the perspective of consumer protection, it doesn't guarantee lower prices.\n\n\"I'm skeptical that disclosure of health care prices will drive prices down, and could even increase prices once hospitals and doctors know what their competitors down the street are getting paid,\" Levitt wrote.\n\nThis executive order is the latest in a series of moves from the Trump administration on health care price transparency recently. As NPR reported, just last month the White House announced its legislative priorities for ending surprise medical bills, which included patients receiving a \"clear and honest bill upfront\" before scheduled care. That same week, HHS announced a final rule requiring drugmakers to display list prices of their drugs in TV ads.\n\nHowever, several of President Trump's past health care announcements have gotten tied up before the promises to lower costs could be realized.\n\nFor instance, in May 2018, Trump rolled out a Blueprint To Lower Drug Prices which included a variety of proposals intended to reduce pharmaceutical costs to individuals, the industry and the economy as a whole, as NPR reported.\n\nIn October of last year, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services proposed an international pricing model for setting what Medicare Part B would pay for certain drugs. This is the closest the Trump administration has come to Trump's campaign promise to have Medicare negotiate with drug companies.\n\nThe proposal was put out for public comment with a December 2018 deadline. Thousands of comments came in, including a lot of pushback from the pharmaceutical industry and the proposed rule has not yet been finalized and it's not clear it ever will be."

Two South Florida businessmen may hold information that can unlock the scandal. A former Florida cop is eagerly awaiting testimony, and a Florida investment banker could alter the narrative with his vote.\n\nFor just the fourth time in U.S. history, the House of Representatives this week will hold impeachment hearings \u2014 and Floridians are playing starring roles in the escalating political drama. In Congress, White House war rooms and court houses, these Florida men and women are now central figures in the investigation into President Donald Trump, himself a recent Florida transplant.\n\nHere are the Floridians Trump has called on to help him, those who will decide his fate and a few shady figures from this sunny state who could contribute to his downfall.\n\nTrump says his phone call with Ukraine president Volodymyr Zelensky was \"perfect\" and there was no \"quid pro quo\" in the face of mounting testimony suggesting otherwise. Chief of staff Mick Mulvaney tried to clear the air at a news conference last month and instead seemed to acknowledge an extortion \u2014 \"We do that all the time with foreign policy,\" he told reporters \u2014 before walking it back. Meanwhile, Congressional Republicans are offering an evolving defense of the president, with some recently conceding Trump's actions crossed a line but weren't impeachable.\n\nThe muddled messaging has led Trump to lash out against Republicans on Twitter. Meanwhile, polls show that the American public, once strongly opposed to impeachment, is warming up to the idea.\n\nEnter Pam Bondi.\n\nThe former Florida attorney general is one of two new White House hires who will focus on messaging as the impeachment investigation moves into the public realm. One of the first high-profile Florida Republicans to publicly support Trump in 2016, Bondi is now putting aside her second career as a lobbyist to join Trump's impeachment team.\n\nBondi, whose 2014 reelection campaign accepted a $25,000 check from Trump's charitable foundation, was long-rumored for a role in the White House. In her new assignment, Bondi brings considerable legal and communication experience to the role from her days in Tallahassee and as a prosecutor and public face of the Hillsborough State Attorney's Office.\n\n\"The president is his best spokesperson,\" Bondi told Fox & Friends last week, \"and this is just helping with a huge team and doing a lot of other special projects.\"\n\nTrump's top defender on Fox News has already demonstrated his flair for theatrics during the impeachment proceedings.\n\nThree weeks ago, Gaetz led a Republican storming of the secure room where the House Intelligence Committee conducted closed-door impeachment hearings. The attempt failed \u2014 \"Please, absent yourself,\" Committee Chairman Adam Schiff instructed Gaetz \u2014 but the stunt nevertheless landed Gaetz all over cable news and affirmed the Panhandle Republican would have a leading part in the GOP rebuttal to the Democratic investigation.\n\nThe House Intelligence Committee began its first hearings Wednesday with the testimony of George Kent and William Taylor, two leading state department officials on Ukraine. Gaetz isn't on the committee, but he does serve on the House Judiciary Committee, which may ultimately draft articles of impeachment.\n\n\"I'll confess to a modest amount of FOMO (fear of missing out),\" Gaetz told the Tampa Bay Times this week. \"The judiciary committee should be holding these hearings but because the Republicans on the committee have whooped the Democrats' butts, they've deprived us of that. Its frustrating.\"\n\nUnlike recent hearings, the upcoming testimony will take place in the open over the next week. Gaetz has been known to swing by committee hearings. He stopped by the House Oversight Committee in February to stare down Trump's fixer and lawyer Michael Cohen as he testified on Capitol Hill.\n\n\"I may wander by. I don't think they can kick me out during an open hearing,\" Gaetz said. \"I don't expect Chariman Schiff to deliver an invitation under my office door.\"\n\nThe Orlando Democrat is in a rare position. She is one of just three members of Congress tasked with investigating the president as a member of the Intelligence Committee and drafting possible articles of impeachment on the Judiciary Committee. It gives the former police chief a front-row seat to history and a consequential voice in what happens to Trump.\n\nDemings was one of the first Democrats to push for impeachment proceedings after special counselor Robert Mueller unveiled the findings of his investigation into Russian election interference. As one of the few people granted access to the close door impeachment testimony of state department officials, her resolve has only strengthened, Demings said. It's not just that he pressured a foreign leader to investigate a political opponent, she said, but the threat to withhold $400 million in military aid from Ukraine put a strategic ally at risk engaged in a conflict against a global adversary.\n\n\"It's one thing to read a transcript that's 300 pages, it's another to see someone like (ambassador to Ukraine) William Taylor, who has been in public service for 50 years, a decorated veteran \u2014 it's pretty powerful to hear testimony directly from him,\" Demings said.\n\n\"The bottomline is clearly, the president of the United States has abused his power, has betrayed the oath of office and has jeopardized national security,\" she told the Times this week. \"The only unanswered question is what do we want to do about it as a Congress.\"\n\nUnlike most Republicans, Rooney has openly criticized Trump for his July 25 phone call with Ukraine and the motivations behind it. And mid-October, Rooney appeared open to impeachment.\n\n\"The issue of using the power and prestige of our country to bring pressure on a foreign government to deal with political activities, not American security interest activities, is bothersome to me,\" the Naples Republican said in a NPR interview. \"And it's a big deal.\"\n\nRooney, a former ambassador and investment banker, has since announced he will retire at the end of his term. And on Oct. 31 he sided with his GOP colleagues voting against formalizing the impeachment investigation.\n\nBut he didn't shut the door on eventually voting to remove Trump from office, giving Democrats some hope it could add a bipartisan voice to their efforts.\n\n\"I have consistently kept an open mind and listened to the facts as presented,\" Rooney said in a statement, \"and will continue to do so.\"\n\nThe two South Florida businessmen with Ukrainian ties have become major figures in the drive to impeach Trump.\n\nParnas and Fruman, associates of Trump's personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, were arrested last month on international campaign finance violations. Authorities allege they were involved in an operation to oust the ambassador to Ukraine, who was seen as a barrier to Giuliani's efforts to investigate Joe Biden's son, Hunter Biden, and other political conspiracies.\n\nFiona Hill, a former National Security Council official whose testimony has been among the most damaging to Trump, said she was warned by colleagues that Parnas and Fruman were \"notorious in Florida and that they were bad news.\"\n\nThe two somehow rose the ranks of wealthy Republican donors in Palm Beach GOP circles. They donated $50,000 to the campaign of Gov. Ron DeSantis and held a fundraiser with Donald Trump, Jr. The Times recently reported that Parnas and Fruman were VIPs at DeSantis' inauguration.\n\nParnas and Fruman have pleaded not guilty.\n\nTrump's former political adviser and longtime confidant isn't central to the ongoing impeachment investigation \u2014 yet.\n\nStone is on trial for lying to congressional investigators and witness tampering related to the Mueller investigation. He was arrested in January during an early-morning raid of his Fort Lauderdale home. Prosecutors allege he was a go-between for the Trump campaign and Wikileaks, the international organization credited with hacking Democratic National Committee emails.\n\nThe trial has shed new light on the Trump campaign's dealings with Wikileaks Former Trump campaign aide Rick Gates testified this week that Trump discussed WikiLeaks with Stone, which appeared to contradict what Trump told Mueller in a written statement.\n\n\"I do not recall discussing WikiLeaks with him,\" Trump wrote. \"Nor do I recall being aware of Mr. Stone having discussed WikiLeaks with individuals associated with my campaign.\" Gates testified both those things happened.\n\nDemocrats so far have focused the impeachment investigation entirely on Trump's dealings with Ukraine.

        "text": "Most voters say there is little to no chance they will change their minds about the impeachment inquiry into President Donald Trump's conduct, even as public hearings are set to kick off on Wednesday, according to a new POLITICO/Morning Consult poll.\n\nA majority of voters, 62 percent, say there is no chance they could change their minds about impeachment, the poll shows. Another 19 percent say there's only a small chance they change their minds.\n\nComparatively, only 2 percent say there is a strong chance they could change their mind, and another 8 percent say there is \"some\" chance they'll change their mind.\n\nAs the hearings begin Wednesday morning in the House Intelligence Committee, the poll shows voters' opinions about the impeachment investigation have changed little since House Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced the opening of a formal inquiry back in September.\n\nThe new poll shows 50 percent of voters support the impeachment inquiry, compared with 41 percent who oppose it. Inearly October, 50 percent of voters supported the inquiry, while 44 percent opposed it.\n\nAs in previous POLITICO/Morning Consult polls, support for actually impeaching and removing Trump tracks closely with support for the inquiry. The new survey shows that 49 percent of voters support the House impeaching Trump, and 48 percent support the Senate removing him.\n\nDemocrats hope the public hearings make the details of the Ukraine scandal more digestible for voters at home. Asked in the POLITICO/Morning Consult poll whether they believe the Trump administration \"withheld military aid from Ukraine in order to pressure the country's government to investigate\" Trump's political rivals, more than two in 10 voters, 22 percent, say they have no opinion.\n\nA plurality, 48 percent, say they definitely or probably believe the administration withheld military aid from Ukraine in order to pressure that country's government, while 30 percent say they definitely or probably don't believe that. Similarly, 49 percent say Trump \"abused his power to influence the 2020 election,\" while 34 percent say he \"was acting within his power as president.\"\n\nAsked about watching the upcoming public hearings, just 27 percent say it's \"very likely\" they will watch, while another 31 percent say it's \"somewhat likely.\" But 33 percent say it's not likely they'll watch the impeachment hearings.\n\nWhile Wednesday is dripping with drama on Capitol Hill, voters at home think it's unlikely the proceedings will result in Trump's impeachment and removal. Only 8 percent say it's \"very likely\" the Senate will remove the president, and just 14 percent say it's even \"somewhat likely.\" A combined 62 percent say it's either \"not too likely\" or not likely at all that Trump will be removed from office.\n\nBut the poll also shows voters believe the Democratic-controlled House will impeach Trump, even if it doesn't result in his removal.\n\n\"Our polling suggests voters are pessimistic that a House impeachment of President Trump will result in a Senate conviction,\" said Tyler Sinclair, Morning Consult's vice president. \"Notably, 51 percent of voters \u2014 including 61 percent of Democrats, 48 percent of independents, and 42 percent of Republicans \u2014 believe the House of Representatives will impeach Trump but the Senate won't remove him from office.\"\n\nThe POLITICO/Morning Consult poll was conducted Nov. 8-10, surveying 1,993 registered voters. The margin of sampling error is plus or minus 2 percentage points.\n\nMorning Consult is a nonpartisan media and technology company that provides data-driven research and insights on politics, policy and business strategy."

Ergo, the chances of the recanvass changing the outcome of the election are super small. \n\nIn fact, back in 2015, it was Governor Bevin's primary challenger James Comer who requested the recanvass after an even closer election. The recanvass found no new votes (as in zero), and Bevin was later declared the official winner.\n\nAssuming this year's recanvass yields the same results, Bevin will have three options ahead of him. He can: \n\nConcede to Andy Beshear, who is already calling himself governor-elect;\nContest the election, and say why he thinks it wasn't free and fair;\nDemand a recount.\nIf he chooses option 3, he'll have to pay for it himself according to Kentucky state law. Kentucky (and Indiana, for the record) join the majority of states in the U.S. in not requiring automatic recounts for close elections.\n\nTo Bevin's credit, though, in quite a few other states an election this close would get an automatic recount paid for by the state. The unofficial results show him around 5,000 votes behind Beshear, which amounts to a 0.4% margin. \n\nIn South Carolina, for example, any election closer than 1% gets an automatic state-funded recount. Alabama, Colorado, and Florida have a stricter threshold of 0.5%, but even there this election would trigger the recount.\n\nThe recanvassing begins on Thursday at 9 a.m. We'll keep you updated with the results online, on-air, and on our app. (If you don't have that yet, here's a link.)"

        "text": "More than 700,000 young immigrants, who came of age in America but have lacked permanent legal status, look to the U.S. Supreme Court on Tuesday to uphold a program protecting them from deportation to countries they've never truly known.\n\nThe justices are hearing oral arguments in a case challenging President Donald Trump's controversial 2017 decision to end Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA, which grants qualified immigrants temporary residency and work privileges.\n\nThe outcome could determine whether those young people, many of whom have registered with the government since 2012, may continue living and working legally in the U.S. or could be subject to removal.\n\n\"I grew up here. This is the only place I know. I have done nothing wrong. I just want a normal life like everyone else,\" said Carolina Fung Feng, 30, a Costa Rican immigrant and DACA recipient, who came to New York when she was 12 years old.\n\neng is among hundreds of DACA recipients and advocates expected to demonstrate outside the court to draw attention to their case, which has won bipartisan support from hundreds of U.S. business groups, churches, law enforcement organizations and educational institutions.\n\n\"I feel like it's a 50-50 chance. The court could go either way,\" Feng said. \"But even if the decision is not favorable, we will continue to fight.\"\n\nDACA -- which was created by President Barack Obama after Congress failed to enact legislation -- allows immigrants who came to the U.S. under the age of 16, without a criminal record and who have completed or are attending school to pay a fee, register with the government and receive a temporary waiver from deportation and ability to work.\n\nBeginning last month, dozens of DACA recipients began marching on foot from New York City to Washington to attend oral arguments -- a 230-mile trip which took two weeks to complete.\n\n\"Our members are looking to the justices to do the right thing, to uphold the three separate lower court decisions and to refuse to submit to the lawlessness of a president who wants them to do his dirty work,\" said Greisa Martinez, a DACA recipient and deputy executive director of United We Dream, a grassroots advocacy group.\n\nTrump moved to end the initiative in 2017, accusing his predecessor of abusing executive power to shield undocumented immigrants when Congress had failed to act legislatively.\n\nFollowing several legal challenges, federal courts put Trump's phase-out of the program on hold, pending appeals. No new applications are being accepted, but the Department of Homeland Security is processing renewals for immigrants already in the program.\n\nThe Trump Administration has approved more than 373,000 renewal requests since 2017.\n\n\"We don't know how the court's going to rule. The court could ask DHS to put pens down and stop reviewing applications,\" said Leezia Dhalla, a Canadian-born DACA recipient who immigrated to Texas in 1996 and graduated from Northwestern University. \"There's also a chance the justices could reopen DACA in its original form. For now, we're telling people to get their renewals in.\"\n\nAntonio Alarcon, whose parents brought him to the U.S. from Mexico when he was 10, is one of the DACA recipient plaintiffs in the case before the Supreme Court this week.\n\n\"Every day we contribute to the country, and I hope the court will see the human aspect of DACA,\" Alarcon said of his message to the justices.\n\nSeven years after the program was created, many of the DACA recipients have become deeply intertwined in American society and advocates say their families include 256,000 U.S. citizen children.\n\n\"This is an enormously important, stupid case,\" said Tom Goldstein, a constitutional lawyer and founder of SCOTUSblog. \"Enormously important for the individuals involved and immigration policy, but stupid because if Obama can create the program then Trump can withdraw it. But the issue is accountability.\"\n\nThe case centers on the rationale the Trump administration gave for ending the program and whether that decision was unlawfully arbitrary.\n\nIn September 2017, then-acting Secretary of Homeland Security Elaine Duke issued the order rescinding DACA because she said that the administration had deemed it \"unconstitutional\" and \"effectuated \u2026 without proper statutory authority.\"\n\nSeveral federal courts found that reasoning \"arbitrary and capricious\" in violation of the federal Administrative Procedures Act. In one case challenging DACA, however, a federal judge has said the same of Obama's decision in creating the program in the first place.\n\n\"All they have said is that they did it because they had to, because the DACA program was unlawful, despite the fact that no court anywhere had found it unlawful,\" said Karen Tumlin, director of the Justice Action Center and an attorney involved with one of the cases before the court.\n\nThe Trump administration argues that the program was created by executive authority and can reasonably be discontinued at the president's discretion. They say the courts can't even review the decision.\n\n\"There's no question the initial justification they gave was an attempt not to give a justification,\" said Omar Jadwat, an attorney with the American Civil Liberties Union. \"None of the things they're now saying did they say when they terminated the program.\"\n\nSome legal experts think that in taking the case -- without a notable split among lower courts -- suggests that the Supreme Court is poised to reverse those lower court decisions.\n\n\"There's a pretty good chance President Trump will prevail and the rationale will be significant,\" said John Blackman, an associate law professor at South Texas College of Law.\n\n\"Even if the court upholds recision, however, that doesn't mean people are getting removed right away. The initial policy called for a six-month phase-out,\" he said. \"If we count six months from the beginning of July, (when a court opinion is expected), that puts us basically into January 2021 which is after the election.\"\n\n\"So the outcome of the 2020 election will largely dictate the fate of the 'Dreamers,'\" Blackman surmised.\n\nTrump has called the DACA recipients, also known as \"Dreamers,\" based on never-passed proposals in Congress called the DREAM Act, \"absolutely incredible kids\" and promised that \"we'll take care of everybody,\" but the administration has not proposed a solution.\n\nEarlier this year, the Democrat-controlled U.S. House of Representatives passed a measure that would establish a pathway to citizenship for 2.5 million DACA recipients, including those affected by Trump's cancellation of the program. The White House said Trump would veto it.\n\nFor DACA recipients, the uncertainty of the outcome of the Supreme Court case means renewed anxiety about their futures in the only country they've known.\n\n\"I carry a poem that my grandmother wrote: 'Speak because it's your life, speak because you can,'\" said Sana A., a Pakistani immigrant and DACA recipient who did not want to give her last name in order to protect her identity.\n\n\"DACA has enabled me to speak in so many more ways,\" she said.\n\nThe Supreme Court is expected to deliver it's decision in the case by the end of June 2020."

        "text": "Senate Judiciary Chairman Lindsey Graham asserted Sunday that the impeachment inquiry into President Donald Trump is \"invalid\" unless the identity of the anonymous whistleblower whose complaint sparked House Democrats' probe is revealed.\n\nGraham, whose committee would be at the center of Trump's trial in the Senate should the House approve articles of impeachment against the President, also said in his Sunday interview with Fox News that the process would be \"dead on arrival\" in the Republican-controlled chamber if the whistleblower doesn't testify before Congress.\n\n\"I consider any impeachment in the House that doesn't allow us to know who the whistleblower is to be invalid because without the whistleblower complaint, we wouldn't be talking about any of this and I also see the need for Hunter Biden to be called to adequately defend the President and if you don't do those two things it's a complete joke,\" Graham, a South Carolina Republican, said.\n\nHe continued: \"It's impossible to bring this case forward in my view fairly without us knowing who the whistleblower is and having a chance to cross examine them about any biases they may have. So if they don't call the whistleblower in the House, this thing is dead on arrival in the Senate.\"\n\nCNN has reached out to Graham for clarification on what he means by \"invalid.\"\n\nThe comments from Graham come a day after House Republicans and Democrats sparred over whether the whistleblower would provide testimony as part of the impeachment inquiry, an aspect of the process that was seen as critical during the start of it, but was put to rest Saturday by House Intelligence Chairman Adam Schiff.\n\nHouse Republicans had submitted to Democrats earlier Saturday a list of witnesses they'd like to testify as part of the chamber's impeachment inquiry into Trump and Ukraine, seeking testimony from the whistleblower, former Vice President Joe Biden's son Hunter Biden and former US special envoy for Ukraine Kurt Volker, among others.\n\n\"As of right now, they are giving us no witnesses,\" California Rep. Devin Nunes, the top Republican on the House Intelligence Committee, told Fox News Saturday night. Democrats have so far received testimony from 15 witnesses that they called before the committee.\n\nBut Schiff, in his letter to Nunes on Saturday, said the whistleblower's testimony would be \"redundant and unnecessary.\"\n\n\"The impeachment inquiry, moreover, has gathered an ever-growing body of evidence \u2013 from witnesses and documents, including the President's own words in his July 25 call record \u2013 that not only confirms, but far exceeds, the initial information in the whistleblower's complaint. The whistleblower's testimony is therefore redundant and unnecessary,\" the letter, obtained by CNN Saturday night, read.\n\nSchiff also argued in his letter that \"in light of the President's threats, the individual's appearance before us would only place their personal safety at grave risk.\"\n\nThe President has been encouraging media outlets to out the whistleblower, and he wrote in a September tweet that \"Like every American, I deserve to meet my accuser.\"\n\nThe whistleblower's complaint at the heart of the House's inquiry alleges that Trump pushed Ukraine to investigate Joe Biden, the former vice president's son and the 2016 election in order to help the President politically and that the White House took steps to cover it up. Trump has denied doing anything improper.\n\nTrump has pushed an unproven accusation that then-Vice President Biden improperly tried to help his son by pressuring the Ukrainian government to fire the country's prosecutor general. Hunter Biden served on the board of the Ukrainian natural gas company at the time.\n\nThere is no evidence of wrongdoing by either Joe or Hunter Biden in Ukraine.\n\nAsked during a Sunday interview on Fox News about the possibility that outing the person could send a \"chilling message\" to other government officials looking to file complaints, White House press secretary Stephanie Grisham said protecting whistleblowers is important but so is questioning their motivations.\n\n\"Whistleblower protections are important,\" she said. \"But you can't just not question the motivations of this whistleblower.\"\n\nBut at least one Republican lawmaker, Texas Rep. Will Hurd, has spoken out against revealing the identity of the whistleblower.\n\n\"I think we should be protecting the identity of the whistleblower, I've said that since the very beginning,\" Hurd told Fox News in a Sunday interview, adding: \"How we treat this whistleblower will impact whistleblowers in the future.\""

        "text": "Sharply at odds with liberal justices, the Supreme Court's conservative majority seemed ready Tuesday to allow the Trump administration to abolish protections that permit 660,000 immigrants to work in the U.S., free from the threat of deportation.\n\nThat outcome would \"destroy lives,\" declared Justice Sonia Sotomayor, one the court's liberals who repeatedly suggested the administration has not adequately justified its decision to end the seven-year-old Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program. Nor has it taken sufficient account of the personal, economic and social disruption that might result, they said.\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) \u2014But there did not appear to be any support among the five conservatives for blocking the administration. The nine-member court's decision is expected by June, at the height of the 2020 presidential campaign.\n\nPresident Donald Trump said on Twitter that DACA recipients shouldn't despair if the justices side with him, pledging that \"a deal will be made with the Dems for them to stay!\" But Trump's past promises to work with Democrats on a legislative solution for these immigrants have led nowhere.\n\nThe president also said in his tweet that many program participants, brought to the U.S. as children and now here illegally, are \"far from \u2018angels,'\" and he claimed that \"some are very tough, hardened criminals.\" The program bars anyone with a felony conviction from participating, and serious misdemeanors may also bar eligibility.\n\nSome DACA recipients, commonly known as \"Dreamers,\" were in the courtroom for the arguments, and many people camped out in front of the court for days for a chance at some of the few seats available. The term comes from never-passed proposals in Congress called the DREAM Act.\n\nThe high court arguments did not involve any discussion of individual DACA recipients or Trump's claims.\n\nInstead the focus was on whether either of two administration rationales for ending DACA, begun under President Barack Obama, was enough.\n\nTrump's anti-immigrant rhetoric was a key part of his presidential campaign in 2016, and his administration has pointed to a court ruling striking down the expansion of DACA and creation of similar protections, known as DAPA, for undocumented immigrants whose children are U.S. citizens as reasons to bring the program to a halt.\n\nAfter lower courts stepped in to keep the program alive, the administration produced a new explanation memo from Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen.\n\nChief Justice John Roberts and Justice Brett Kavanaugh were among the justices who indicated on Tuesday that the administration has provided sufficient reason for doing away with the program. Kavanaugh referred to Nielsen's memo at one point as \"a very considered decision.\" Roberts suggested that worries that DACA is not legal might be enough to support ending it.\n\nRoberts, who could hold the pivotal vote on the court, aimed his few questions at lawyers representing DACA recipients and their supporters. He did not seriously question the administration's argument.\n\nHowever, justices' questions don't always foretell their votes. In June the chief justice surprised many when he cast the deciding vote to prevent the administration from adding a citizenship question to the 2020 census, despite not voicing much skepticism during arguments in the case.\n\nJustices Neil Gorsuch and Samuel Alito raised questions on Tuesday about whether courts should even be reviewing the executive branch's discretionary decisions.\n\nSotomayor made the only direct reference to Trump, saying he told DACA recipients \"that they were safe under him and that he would find a way to keep them here. And so he hasn't.\"\n\nShe also complained that the administration's rationale has shifted over time and has mainly relied on the view that DACA is illegal, leaving no choice but to end it.\n\nIn her most barbed comment, Sotomayor said the administration has failed to plainly say \"that this is not about the law. This is about our choice to destroy lives.\"\n\nSolicitor General Noel Francisco, representing the administration, did not directly respond to Sotomayor. But near the end of the 80-minute arguments, he asserted that the administration has taken responsibility for its decision and is relying on more than merely its belief that DACA is illegal. The administration has the authority to end DACA, even if it's legal, because it's bad policy, he said. \"We own this,\" Francisco said.\n\nIf the court agrees with the administration in the DACA case, Congress could follow up by voting to put the program on surer legal footing. But the absence of comprehensive immigration reform by Congress is what prompted Obama to create DACA in the first place, in 2012, giving people two-year renewable reprieves from the threat of deportation while also allowing them to work.\n\nYoung immigrants, civil rights groups, universities and Democratic-led cities and states sued to block the administration. They persuaded courts in New York, San Francisco and Washington, D.C., that the administration had been \"arbitrary and capricious\" in its actions, in violation of a federal law that requires policy changes to be done in an orderly way.\n\nIf the justices sustain the challenges, the administration could try again to end the program. A lawsuit in Texas claiming that DACA is illegal also would be likely to go forward."

I really don't know what's going on. I do know this. I know that John was a hero, and will continue to be a hero, and I think most Americans would agree with me on that, whether you agreed with his politics or not, he was a good man.\"\n\nMcCain also offered an opinion on what her husband would think of the current political climate.\n\n\"Oh, gosh,\" she said. \"I think he'd be disgusted with some of the stuff that's going on right now.\"\n\nThe interview also touched on her addiction to prescription drugs, her support for immigrants, McCain friend Sen. Lindsey Graham's somewhat-bizarre support of Trump (\"I have offered my advice, yes I have\"), her husband's campaigns for the presidency, his return to Washington, D.C., for his now-famous thumbs-down vote on repealing Obamacare (the entire family told him not to travel but he wouldn't hear of it) and more.\n\nFor instance, Axelrod asked her whether she seriously considered stepping in for her husband in the U.S. Senate after he died, an idea that was floated in some circles \u2014 evidently some important circles. \n\n\"I was talked to seriously,\" she said. \"I did think about it. But at the time it was just moments after my husband had died. I had to weigh which was more important, and my family was more important.\"\n\nShe also said that it was ultimately her decision not to invite Trump to her husband's funeral.\n\n\"Well, I had to worry about my family,\" she said. \"The family was somewhat bitter about things that had been said about their dad. It would have been very disruptive to my children, and so I took their lead on this whole thing. It was ultimately my choice and my decision. \u2026 I didn't want anything to overshadow John McCain that day.\"\n\nShe also talked about her husband's last moments alive, and how fitting they were. They had just finished lunch.\n\n\"I knew it was close,\" she said.\n\nMcCain was in bed, overlooking the creek outside their home in Cornville. They were listening to music.\n\n\"On the playlist, it comes up Frank Sinatra, \u2018My Way,' on its own,\" she said. \"Then one of the hawks that he loved so much that nested up there, he was sitting on the corner of the roof and then he flew across the yard and landed in a low tree just looking at us and stayed right there, and that was about the moment that John passed.\n\n\"He did it his way. That's what he was all about.\""

Rand Paul (R-Ky.) said on NBC's \"Meet the Press\" Sunday that he thinks it's a mistake for the White House to argue there was no quid pro quo with Ukraine to investigate President Trump's political rivals, and that Trump has \"every right\" to condition military aid on fighting corruption.\n\nWhy it matters: Paul will act as a juror in the Senate trial in the likely event that Trump is impeached by the House. His argument that there's nothing wrong with using military aid as leverage to push Ukraine to carry out investigations is one of several shifting strategies that defenders of the president have deployed.\n\nDemocrats counter that Trump has displayed no interest in fighting \"corruption,\" as Paul argues, and that the investigations he wanted Ukraine to pursue specifically concerned the president's domestic political rivals \u2014 Joe Biden and the Democratic National Committee.\nBloomberg also reported on Saturday that the State Department \"quietly authorized\" the release of $141 million of the aid to Ukraine after lawyers found that the White House had no legal standing to block the funds, which had been appropriated by Congress.\nWorth noting: Paul told NBC's Chuck Todd that he opposes aid to Ukraine altogether. \"I wouldn't give them the aid because we don't have the money,\" the senator said. \"We have to actually borrow the money from China to send it to Ukraine, so I'm against the aid and I think it's a mistake to do the aid so I wouldn't have played any of these games.\""

        "text": "Sen. Rand Paul downplayed the implications of his home state of Kentucky apparently electing a Democratic governor earlier this week, declining to attribute Gov. Matt Bevin's loss to his attempts to nationalize the race.\n\nThe closely watched race between Bevin, the extremely unpopular Republican incumbent, and Andy Beshear, the state's Democratic attorney general, was seen by many in the pundit class as the first major test of how the politics of impeachment would fare in a deep-red state and a potential bellwether for next year's elections. Despite the embattled governor enlisting President Donald Trump in an attempt to save his bid for reelection, Bevin suffered a narrow defeat, though he has not yet conceded and is demanding a recount, citing \"irregularities.\"\n\nThe handful of local elections that took place on Tuesday painted a dark picture for Republicans, as the party continues to suffer losses in suburbs around the country. But Paul charged that Kentucky Republicans have a lot to smile about nevertheless, adopting the \"wave\" rhetoric last seen in last year's midterms applied to Democrats.\n\n\"When you look at all the races \u2014 there were six statewide races \u2014 we won five out of six; Republicans won five out of six,\" Paul said on NBC's \"Meet the Press.\" \"We did lose the governor's race, we were disappointed in it. But the interesting thing is, is we beat a lot of other candidates that no one expected us to. So actually, in many ways, there was sort of a red wave in Kentucky.\"\n\nThat being said, he declined to fault Bevin for attempting to tie his opponent to the national Democratic Party, dismissing the notion that that strategy was necessarily his downfall but suggesting he may have simply been too far underwater to begin with.\n\n\"I think it was mostly particularly about one race,\" he told \"Meet the Press\" host Chuck Todd, pointing to Bevin's abysmal relationship with the state's teachers stemming from his attempts to change the state's pension system.\n\n\"I think the teachers' anger came out,\" Paul contended. But he also pointed to Bevin's poor performance in areas where GOP candidates have traditionally performed well and where other GOP candidates were victorious on Tuesday.\n\n\"So there was also another problem within his base, and that's a complicated matter, but there's a lot of specific reasons and fights within the Republican Party that may have hurt him,\" he suggested.\n\nStill, he said of Bevin's decision to hitch himself to Trump, \"a lot of candidates do that because, you know, we have conservative voters in Kentucky who elect federal representatives overwhelmingly because they're socially conservative and they do support President Trump. So I don't think it's a bad strategy necessarily. But I think that he had some other things to overcome.\"\n\nFILED UNDER: RAND PAUL, DONALD TRUMP, DONALD TRUMP 2020, KENTUCKY, MATT BEVIN,"

        "text": "Another accidental message sent to a reporter may have revealed the identity of Rudy Giuliani's unknown friend \"Charles.\"\n\nIn late October, Giuliani, 75, butt-dialed an NBC reporter and left a three-minute voicemail in which he could be overheard talking to another man about a pending fraud case. Giuliani was overheard saying, \"You know Charles would have a hard time with a fraud case 'cause he didn't do any due diligence.\"\n\nThe comment was made at the beginning of the recording, and without additional context, it was unclear who Charles was. A report from Salon, however, found that Charles Gucciardo may be the individual Giuliani was referring too.\n\nThe Salon reporter was tipped off to Giuliani's ties to Gucciardo after being sent an accidental text message from Giuliani that included what appeared to be an eight-character password.\n\nThe reporter returned Giuliani's message to notify him that he had accidentally sent the password to the wrong contact. Shortly after, the reporter received a call back from someone named Christiann\u00e9 Allen.\n\nAllen, 20, was a Liberty University communications student hired by Giuliani to handle his messaging. Given that it's unusual for someone with as much status as Giuliani to hire a 20-year-old to run his communications effort, the reporter tried to figure out how the two may have met.\n\nWhen digging through Allen's social media, the reporter found that she had worked for Gucciardo Law, a personal injury firm owned by Gucciardo. Other social media posts revealed that the two had met when Allen was at a high school conference with Gucciardo's son.\n\nGucciardo was recently featured in a New York Times report because he gave $500,000 to a company called Fraud Guarantees, which was run by Giuliani's clients Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman. Parnas and Fruman were recently arrested trying to fly to Vienna, a common connection point for flights to Ukraine, for illegal campaign contributions.\n\nWhen Gucciardo cut the checks to Fraud Guarantees, the company had no prior clients or customers. In his accidental voicemail, Giuliani claimed that \"Charles\" had a \"hard time with a fraud case 'cause he didn't do any due diligence.\"\n\nGiuliani's accidental text that prompted Allen to reach out to the reporter led him to be tied to Gucciardo via his 20-year-old assistant, although the identity of \"Charles\" has yet to be confirmed."

        "text": "John A. Reilly Jr., the superintendent of Delaware County's jail, told county officials Monday that he plans to retire following an investigative report on his conduct by The Inquirer and the Caucus.\n\nReilly, 62, sent a letter to county Executive Director Marianne Grace telling her he plans to leave the position he's held overseeing the facility since 2008. His resignation is effective Nov. 27, the same day that Grace will submit to County Council her three selections for the county's new Jail Oversight Board.\n\nReilly did not respond to a request for comment Monday. In the letter, obtained by The Inquirer, Reilly said he was choosing \"not to be a distraction from [county officials'] work or the important work to be started by the county Jail Oversight Board.\"\n\nIn a story first published Friday, The Inquirer and the Caucus detailed allegations of racist and abusive behavior\n\nReilly, in his letter to Grace on Monday, called the allegations false and said they were the result of the \"personal agenda of the complainants.\" He also disputed The Inquirer's reporting with the Caucus.\n\nEfforts to reach Reilly were unsuccessful Monday. His lawyer, Joseph Podraza Jr., said Monday that he was not aware of the letter Reilly had sent to county officials.\n\nNews of Reilly's decision to leave his post comes at a time of significant transition in the county: Last week, Democrats took control of the county's ruling board for the first time in history. And in October, the current County Council unanimously voted to overhaul the board that oversees George W. Hill Correctional Facility, the only privately operated county jail in the state.\n\nThe new Jail Oversight Board will replace the current, politically appointed Board of Prison Inspectors. It will include elected officials and the three members of the public chosen by Grace.\n\nThis change in structure also requires Grace to select a county-employed warden to oversee the prison's operation by the GEO Group. GEO, a global prison conglomerate, is one year into a five-year contract with Delaware County.\n\nWith his announcement Monday, Reilly is removing himself for consideration for that role.\n\nThe 2014 whistle-blower letter, sent by former Warden Cameron Lindsay to the state Attorney General's Office and Delaware County officials, accused Reilly of calling black corrections officers by the N-word in front of senior staffers, referring to Latino workers as \"tacos,\" and once saying he hoped a pregnant female employee would have a child with birth defects.\n\nLindsay also alleged that Reilly directed underlings to target black guards for unnecessary urine tests and searches of their lockers and cars.\n\nDelaware County officials hired an outside lawyer to investigate the allegation, paying her $20,000. There was no written report generated as a result of the probe, only an oral presentation made to County Council members during a closed executive session.\n\nReilly told reporters he had been suspended for 30 days without pay as a result of the investigation, which found that he oversaw an \"unprofessional environment\" in which employees used \"salty language.\"\n\nIn an interview last week, Reilly denied Lindsay's assertions.\n\n\"I realize the allegations are horrible, but I was not involved in any of this,\" he said. \"I didn't say [any of] that.\"\n\nThe Inquirer and the Caucus also reported that Reilly used his position to hire a woman with no corrections experience for a senior position in his office, and that he oversaw bank accounts worth $750,000 that county officials said they had no knowledge of. Reilly said the woman's hiring was appropriate and county officials were aware of the bank accounts."

        "text": "When Amy Klobuchar was first breaking into politics two decades ago, a TV news crew in Minneapolis asked if they could film her family at their house one morning getting ready for the day. But Klobuchar, who started out in public office as the top prosecutor in Minnesota's largest county, turned them down.\n\n\"People were going to realize that my husband makes the peanut butter sandwiches\" for their daughter, Klobuchar recounted in an interview. Twenty years ago, she said, \"I didn't want them to know.\"\n\nThe presidential candidate laughed. \"Now, I don't care.\"\n\nKlobuchar's feeling of liberation comes amid a unique presidential campaign featuring four female politicians and a gay man running for the Democratic nomination. But the candidates \u2014 as well as their spouses \u2014 are trying to figure out on the fly what voters want to see from political husbands. And so far, there's little difference between the relatively low-profile, supportive-spouse role often played by women and how the men are behaving now.\n\nDoug Emhoff, a prominent lawyer married to Kamala Harris, headlines events for his wife and recently compiled recipes from supporters into a cookbook for her birthday, posting the moment on Twitter. Elizabeth Warren's husband, Bruce Mann, made his 2020 campaign debut with a nearly silent cameo in an Instagram Live broadcast that generated far more scrutiny for the beverage (Michelob Ultra) Warren sipped; now, Mann, a Harvard Law School professor and legal historian, can often be seen lingering on the sidelines of campaign events as Warren works her way through hourslong picture lines.\n\nKlobuchar's husband, John Bessler, a law professor at the University of Baltimore, sat alongside her on an Iowa bus tour last month, fielding voter questions one-on-one at events and watching his wife from the crowd. And Chasten Buttigieg, a teacher whose social media activity has given him the biggest public profile, recently embarked on a fundraising tour of European cities but is better known for flooding Twitter and Instagram with endearing anecdotes and affection, coloring in the public portrait of his husband Pete Buttigieg as the little-known Midwestern mayor became a political star.\n\nBut the campaigns have kept watchful eyes on the male spouses' schedules, and most have been careful not to ramp up their public work too quickly for fear of interfering with the candidates' introductions this year.\n\nThe \"biggest complexity is making sure the public isn't getting to know the spouse faster than the candidate,\" said one campaign official, who was granted anonymity to discuss the issue candidly, explaining why some of the candidates' husbands are starting to play more prominent public roles in recent months.\n\nThat's because political strategists, academics and other observers have long seen a pattern play out when female candidates put their husbands front and center: \"People start to question, who's really in charge?\" said Kelly Dittmar, a Rutgers University professor who studies women in American politics.\n\n\"For men, there's more complicated terrain in just how active they want to be in order to preserve the independent view of their wife,\" Dittmar continued.\n\nThat was a dynamic former Michigan Gov. Jennifer Granholm's husband, Dan Mulhern, battled when she became the state's first female chief executive in 2003. In an interview, Mulhern said he and Granholm dealt with \"sexist undertones and implicit bias,\" including \"people who thought I was somehow calling the shots, which is the furthest thing from the truth.\"\n\n\"That's the liability, potentially undermining your female spouse who's a female executive,\" said Mulhern. \"We're looking for a picture of power, and we haven't had a lot of examples of men in blue suits be the supporter, rather than at center stage.\"\n\nA primary in the year 2020 is a relatively safe space to begin pushing past these questions, according to Democratic campaign operatives. And the campaigns still have to focus on managing public impressions of the candidates before they can worry too much about their husbands.\n\n\"It's something I think about, but not the number one thing,\" said one senior campaign official. \"Before we get to the gendered perceptions of the potential first man, we have to tackle the gendered perceptions of the first female president.\"\n\nBut Democrats are already wondering how general election voters \u2014 or President Donald Trump, with his uninhibited record of prodding societal hot buttons \u2014 will react next year.\n\n\"In the general election, it's a different story,\" said another senior campaign official, who added: \"That's when how and what way we roll out [the husband] will matter more, when it will be a more complicated question as to how to do it.\"\n\nVoters have not often seen men in the \"supportive role\" in campaigns, said Jen Palmieri, a former communications director for Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama's presidential campaigns. And when they have, it has largely been for legislative roles, not executive ones: Only 3 percent of governors in American history have been women, according to an analysis by Dittmar.\n\n\"It's a challenge to puzzle through how voters want to see it, what kind of role they want to see that man in,\" Palmieri said. \"There's no playbook for it.\"\n\nSome of the other 2020 spouses can literally open the playbook from their husbands' past campaigns. Former second lady Jill Biden is a regular presence in the early states for former Vice President Joe Biden's campaign, while Jane Sanders continues to play a critical strategic role for Bernie Sanders, as she did in 2016.\n\n MOST READ\nbiden-25057.jpg\nWhite House believes massive Dem bailout may be needed to pass debt ceiling compromise\nRon DeSantis Has a Problem. It's Florida.\nFlorida school limits access to Amanda Gorman's inaugural poem after parental complaint\nThe Media Has Got Ron DeSantis Nailed\nCourt sets legal showdown on debt limit 14th Amendment argument\n\nBut the 2020 husbands also said that in some ways, they feel little has changed from their spouses' previous elections \u2014 \"although the scale of this is much, much bigger,\" said Bessler, Klobuchar's husband. Nor has the pressure of the national campaign forced them to change who they are, Chasten Buttigieg said.\n\n\"The campaign has never come to me and talked to me about who I am going to present as and who I am going to be to other people,\" Buttigieg said in an interview. \"Very early on in this process, I looked at this team and said, \u2018I'm going to be myself and I'm going to be my authentic self,' and they said, \u2018Yes, you are.'\"\n\nSo far, Mann said the reception by voters has \"been entirely positive.\" But he acknowledged that there are \"undoubtedly some people out there who believe in traditional gender roles that somehow I'm violating by being married to a prominent woman, but I don't encounter [that] at all on the trail, which is nice because it means people are focusing on the issues that are important to them.\"\n\nMann \u2014 who described his role as Warren's husband, and \"not a policy adviser\" \u2014 did offer some early feedback on the Massachusetts senator's stump speech. When she recounted the \"twists and turns\" of her life \u2014 from college scholarship, to falling in love at 19, to getting married and dropping out of school \u2014 Warren didn't initially specify that the story referenced her first husband.\n\nMann, her second husband, said he \"commented rather ruefully, at one point, that when she didn't make the distinction, some people looked askance at me.\"\n\n\"She realized some clarification was in order,\" Mann said, chuckling.\n\nEmhoff and Buttigieg, who is on leave from teaching during the campaign, are the most public-facing husbands on the trail, often posting selfies together and sounding off on each other's social media game. When asked whether he had learned any tricks from his millennial counterpart, Emhoff, 55, shot back, \"Has he learned from me?\"\n\nMann and Bessler are quieter, but still frequent, presences in the primary and caucus states. Bessler often meets behind the scenes with state legislators seeking support for Klobuchar, while Mann takes the couple's golden retriever to Warren events. Tulsi Gabbard's husband, Abraham Williamson, is also not a public surrogate for the Hawaii congresswoman, but the cinematographer is occasionally seen filming footage of his wife.\n\n\"These guys are used to doing this because they've all done it before, and not all of them are following the same path,\" said Jefrey Pollock, a Democratic pollster who advised Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand's now-finished presidential bid. \"Let's get used to this, because it's the new normal.\"\n\nOn the trail, the husbands appear most comfortable when they talk about their partners. Bessler said he frequently gets stopped by voters, asking about his own agenda as potential first gentleman, but \"I try to keep the focus, move it back to Amy,\" he said.\n\nThey've also developed some camaraderie among one another.\n\n\"We're not competing,\" Mann said. \"Our wives may be, but we're not.\"\n\nIn an email, Bessler told Emhoff that he was \"now head of security\" for Harris, after Emhoff leapt on stage at a forum in San Francisco to wrestle off a protester, who grabbed the microphone away from his wife. Mann and Bessler geek out occasionally on their shared academic interests, \"talking about the founding of this country\" between political events, Bessler said.\n\nEmhoff texts Chasten Buttigieg to ask whether he'll be attending multicandidate forums. The pair exchanged phone numbers earlier this year, after sliding into each other's direct messages on Twitter.\n\n\"You forge these relationships, kind of apolitically, because you're sharing something that's very unique,\" Emhoff said, adding: \"This campaign is so intense that you can't really share this experience with anyone other than someone else who's going through it.\"\n\nButtigieg recalled a backstage meeting in a green room where he and Emhoff talked about their political spouses and leaned on each other's experiences.\n\n\"It feels like they're out there doing the thing, and we're kind of trying to figure [out] who we are, and where we fit,\" Buttigieg said, adding: \"We were just talking about being on the road a lot, being away from home, being away from the person who we love the most.\"\n\nOne example of a shared experience for the husbands came in June, after the first Democratic debate in Miami, when Emhoff greeted activists outside one of Harris' post-debate stops. An eager supporter rushed up, asking for a photo, calling him \"Mr. Harris.\"\n\n\"This is my life,\" Emhoff said with a grin."

        "text": "A longtime career employee at the White House Office of Management and Budget is expected to break ranks and testify Saturday in the House Democrats' impeachment inquiry, potentially filling in important details on the holdup of military aid to Ukraine.\n\nMark Sandy would be the first OMB employee to testify in the inquiry, after OMB acting director Russell T. Vought and two other political appointees at the agency defied congressional subpoenas to appear. The White House has called the impeachment inquiry unconstitutional and ordered administration officials not to participate.\n\nUnlike these other OMB officials, Sandy is a career employee, not one appointed by the president. He has worked at the agency off and on for over a decade, under presidents of both parties, climbing the ranks to his current role as deputy associate director for national security programs.\n\n\"If he is subpoenaed, he will appear,\" Sandy's lawyer, Barbara \"Biz\" Van Gelder, said Thursday evening.\n\nSandy is expected to testify during a closed-door deposition, which is not open to the public. Typically, witnesses in the impeachment inquiry have been served with subpoenas immediately before their depositions are scheduled to begin, an approach Democrats say is designed to give them cover against an administration that has ordered officials not to comply with the inquiry.\n\nVan Gelder declined further comment.\n\nThe Washington Post's Shane Harris, Paul Kane and Amber Phillips break down what happens next in the effort to impeach President Trump. (Video: Zach Purser Brown/The Washington Post)\nUntil now, OMB has served as a bulwark for President Trump against the impeachment inquiry, since top officials have refused to testify. A senior administration official, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss the ongoing inquiry, discounted the importance of Sandy's testimony and criticized House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) and Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam B. Schiff (D-Calif.) for calling him to testify.\n\n\"Democrats are going to be sorely disappointed when their latest false narrative isn't confirmed,\" the official said. \"With nothing to show after three years trying to impeach the President, Speaker Pelosi and Rep. Schiff have resorted to threatening dedicated civil servants with subpoenas and depositions without the ability to even have agency counsel present.\"\n\nSandy could provide insight into the process by which some $400 million in military and security aid to Ukraine was held up over the summer. He was among the career staffers who raised questions about the holdup on the aid, people familiar with the matter said, and his role gave him responsibility for signing the documents required to hold it up. The people spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal deliberations.\n\nSandy's signature appears on at least one of these so-called apportionment letters in July that prevented the money from going to Ukraine, according to copies of the documents discussed during an earlier deposition in the impeachment inquiry, a transcript of which was made public. But after that, the process for approving or denying such funds was taken over by a political appointee at OMB, Michael Duffey, who defied a congressional subpoena to testify earlier this month. The money had already been approved by Congress.\n"

        "text": "Republican political operative Roger Stone undermined the effectiveness of the congressional investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election by repeatedly and deliberately lying under oath to help Donald Trump's presidential campaign avoid embarrassment, prosecutors told jurors in closing arguments at his trial Wednesday.\n\nDefense attorneys countered that Stone had done nothing deliberately illegal and claimed the government's case was built on conjecture, leaps of logic and unreliable witnesses.\n\nStone, 67, was indicted in January as part of special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into Russian electoral tampering. A veteran Republican political operative and longtime Trump confidant, Stone is accused of lying to lawmakers about his attempts to communicate with the anti-secrecy website WikiLeaks, tampering with a witness and obstructing a House Intelligence Committee investigation into whether Trump's Republican presidential campaign coordinated with Russia to tip the 2016 election.\n\nThe case is expected to go to the jury on Thursday after about a week of testimony.\n\nIf convicted, Stone could face up to 20 years in prison.\n\nAssistant U.S. Attorney Jonathan Kravis said Stone lied to protect the Trump campaign from embarrassment. Several witnesses have highlighted how campaign officials were eager to take advantage of the more than 19,000 emails that had been hacked by Russia from the Democratic National Committee and were being released in batches by WikiLeaks in the months before the election.\n\nSteve Bannon, who served as the campaign's chief executive, testified that Stone had boasted about his ties to WikiLeaks and its founder Julian Assange, alerting the campaign to pending new batches of damaging emails. Campaign officials saw Stone as the \"access point\" to WikiLeaks, he said.\n\nAs a result, the campaign looked to Stone to make contact with WikiLeaks and learn more about the content and timing of the upcoming email releases.\n\n\"Roger Stone knew that if this information came out, it would look really bad before his longtime friend Donald Trump, so he lied to the committee,\" Kravis said. \"He not only tried but succeeded in impeding the committee's investigation.\"\n\nDefense attorney Bruce Rogow dismissed the attempts to contact Assange as standard operating procedure for any political campaign.\n\n\"There was nothing illegal about the campaign being interested in the information coming out,\" he said. \"Of course they were interested in the WikiLeaks information.\"\n\nRogow also focused on the limits of the government's knowledge. For example, he noted that the government had evidence of multiple phone calls between Stone and different campaign officials, including Trump himself. But there was no evidence of what was actually said during those calls.\n\n\"Why would a decision be made on this kind of thin, very thin \u2026 is it even evidence,\" he told jurors.\n\nRegarding witness tampering, Rogow brushed aside the dozens of emails and text messages in which Stone urged liberal radio host Randy Credico to refuse to testify before Congress or assert his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination. Stone had told the House Intelligence Committee that Credico was his back-channel connection to Assange \u2014 something Credico repeatedly denied.\n\nRogow characterized Stone's frequently profane and threatening messages and emails to Credico as a byproduct of the strange long-term working relationship between two deeply eccentric men from opposite sides of the political spectrum.\n\n\"These two guys tampered with one another for 20 years over all kinds of crazy things,\" he said. \"That's the way these two guys operated.\"\n\nCredico eventually did cite the Fifth Amendment in refusing to testify. But Rogow proposed an alternate theory \u2014 that the talk show host and activist didn't want to \"ruin his reputation is the liberal community\" by revealing that he had been working with Stone and, by proxy, with the Trump campaign.\n\nIn their final statement, government attorneys said Rogow had tried to complicate and muddy what was ultimately an extremely simple case: Stone had repeatedly lied to Congress and the evidence was absolutely clear\n\n\"That's the beautiful thing about this case. The paper here doesn't lie,\" said Assistant U.S. Attorney Michael John Marando. \"The documents do not lie.\""

        "text": "Sen. Rick Scott is backing a bipartisan bill that would allow service members to essentially sue the United States government for medical malpractice if they are injured in the care of military doctors.\n\nThe measure has already passed the House and it has been introduced in the Senate, where Scott says he will sign on as a co-sponsor.\n\n\"As a U.S. Senator and member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, taking care of our military members, veterans and their families is my top priority,\" the Florida Republican said in a statement.\n\nThe bill is called the SFC Richard Stayskal Military Medical Accountability Act of 2019, named after a green beret who is dying of lung cancer. Stayskal was originally misdiagnosed with pneumonia by doctors at Womack Army Medical Center at Fort Bragg in North Carolina. By the time the cancer was caught in 2017, it had already spread to other organs.\n\nHowever, a 1950 Supreme Court ruling prohibits service members for suing for injuries suffered as a result of negligence on the part of the military. Though originally intended to protect doctors who make tough medical calls on the battlefield, it has extended to military personnel who seek treatment outside of combat.\n\nThe bill now moving through the Senate would allow a service member to sue within three years after a misdiagnosis or injury is discovered.\n\nStayskal's case gained national notoriety after a short, chance meeting with President Donald Trump before a North Carolina rally in July. Stayskal told the Military Times that he explained his situation to Trump, who promised he would do something about it.\n\nScott, a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, called Stayskal's story \"heartbreaking\" and it \"never should have happened.\" He is co-sponsoring the Senate legislation \"to make sure our men and women in uniform are taken care of every step of the way.\""

        "text": "A top Massachusetts Democrat says he believes the formal impeachment hearings that get underway this week will convince Americans that President Trump has to go.\n\nU.S. Rep. Stephen Lynch, who sits on the House Oversight Committee, told the Herald that the key for Democrats is to get the witnesses before the public, so everyone can hear the testimony he and other congressmen have been listening to behind closed doors over the past couple of weeks.\n\n\"That was very powerful testimony,\" Lynch said. \"We'll allow them to tell their story and they have supporting documents and have corroborating evidence to build a case.\"\n\nThe House Intelligence Committee's impeachment hearings, which begin on Wednesday, will center around Trump's summer phone call with Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskiy. Big TV networks \u2014 NBC, CBS, ABC and PBS \u2014 all plan to pull normal programming in favor of coverage of the impeachment hearings.\n\nTrump is accused of pushing the Ukrainian president to investigate former vice president and 2020 presidential hopeful Joe Biden and his son Hunter. Days before that reported phone call, Trump froze nearly $400 million in aid to Ukraine. The president has insisted he did nothing wrong and denied that any request for help was tied to the aid freeze.\n\nLynch, who's seeking to chair the Oversight Committee, which will control some of the impeachment hearings, said, \"I don't think we will persuade the American people with pitchforks and torches \u2014 the American people will have to see a process that is legitimate and fair and thoughtful and rooted in the law. We have to be very methodical and thorough and deliberative.\"\n\nU.S. Rep. Joe Kennedy III, who's running for Senate, said Monday, \"I hope that the information that comes before the public indicates that he didn't do anything wrong \u2014 but the information that's come out so far says exactly the opposite.\"\n\nBut Democrats face a difficult task convincing a lukewarm public ahead of the 2020 elections that Trump should be removed from office, political operatives tell the Herald.\n\n\"Democrats have to show an actual pattern of obstruction of justice and collusion \u2014 that it's not just one phone call,\" pollster John Zogby said Monday. \"The pattern needs to be clear and unequivocal, and it remains to be seen if that can be done.\"\n\nTrump tweeted Monday, \"Read the Transcript. It is PERFECT!\"\n\nHe later added about House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, \"Schiff is giving Republicans NO WITNESSES, NO LAWYER & NO DUE PROCESS! It is a totally one sided Witch Hunt. This can't be making the Democrats look good. Such a farce!\"\n\nTrump will continue to play the victim role, Zogby said.\n\n\"He'll say he's not cooperating because it's a witch hunt, and that seems to have worked for him so far,\" he added.\n\nU.S. Rep. Seth Moulton said impeaching the president is all about \"protecting the constitution\" and not about getting a political victory.\n\n\"Every witness who has come before the bipartisan committee has made the case worse for the president,\" Moulton added. \"Now's the time to start sharing this more publicly.\"\n\nBut Ford O'Connell, a Republican strategist, said this will ultimately backfire on Democrats in 2020.\n\n\"They're spending all their time on this and not on the issues that most Americans care about,\" he said. \"This could re-elect Trump and also put the House in play.\""

        "text": "When Republicans swept last week's election, bringing the borough's first all-GOP governing body in at least a half-century, they did so with help from professionals holding municipal contracts. \n\nCouncilwoman Melissa Dabal last week defeated Democrat Elizabeth Calabrese by more than 200 votes and will be the first Republican mayor in nearly three decades. Dabal's running mates, Tomasz Orzechowski and Susanne Preinfalk, won council seats.\n\nOf $12,600 in donations reported to the Election Law Enforcement Commission, or ELEC, by their campaign, more than half \u2014 $6,600 \u2014 was from Borough Attorney Richard Malagiere, Borough Labor Attorney David Corrigan and Borough Engineer Neglia Engineering.\n\nSuch donations are not illegal and, in fact, are common practice throughout the nation, said Viki Harrison of the Washington-based government watchdog group Common Cause.\n\n\"This is so common in municipalities and counties around the country; even though it's not illegal, it is not ethically sound,\" Harrison said. \"Having a policy regarding these donations is a way to avoid the appearance of impropriety, because you can't stop employees from donating to the candidate of their choice.\"\n\nSince the borough has no ordinance of its own, it relies on state statutes that govern pay-to-play, said Malagiere, the borough attorney. \n\nState law dictates that a business can't receive a public contract worth more than $17,500 if it makes a contribution of more than $300 within 18 months before receiving the contract and for the duration of the contract. The limit on donations applies to anyone involved in the decision to grant a public contract.\n\nBut local governments have the option to be subject to state law or to be exempt from it by invoking the \"fair and open\" provision. This means that the governing body can avoid state law by advertising its bidding process.\n\nDavid Goodman, of the New Jersey chapter of RepresentUs, a national grassroots anti-corruption campaign, said the state's pay-to-play situation is a \"crazy quilt, filled with exemptions and loopholes.\"\n\nGoodman said his organization supports the call from ELEC for a \"single, statewide law that would have uniformity and some teeth,\" which was first presented as S-150 in the Legislature in June. \n\nDabal could not be reached for comment. \n\nKatie Sobko is a local reporter for NorthJersey.com.

        "title": "Giuliani associates: Debts, lawsuits and a high-interest loan preceded associates' rise",
        "text": "As federal prosecutors pursue their case against a pair of South Florida businessmen at the center of an alleged plot to hijack the US political process, their trail is sure to lead here if it hasn't already.\n\nThis strip of white sand beaches and towering condos \u2013 a half dozen bearing the name Trump \u2013 is a key location in the lives of Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman, the enigmatic Soviet-born emigres who rose from obscurity to rubbing elbows with the Republican political elite.\n\nParnas, who has recently initiated talks with impeachment investigators through his attorney, was once chauffeured around this beach city by a white-gloved driver behind the wheel of a Rolls Royce, two sources recalled. At the same time, his business was failing, and he was accused of squatting in an associate's condo and threatening the man at gunpoint when asked to leave \u2013 both claims Parnas, 47, denied. Parnas was never charged with a crime.\n\nFruman lived with his wife and three kids in a luxury unit 31 floors above the Atlantic. He recently faced foreclosure on another high-rise unit in neighboring Bal Harbour if he didn't pay up on a $3 million loan he and a brother took out against the property, according to court records. It was a loan that had to be repaid within a year and which required interest of $22,500 a month, the records show. The transaction appears crucial to Parnas' and Fruman's ability to have made large political donations at the heart of the ongoing federal investigation.\n\nFruman's finances \u2013 where his money was coming from and where it was going \u2013 were a hotly contested issue in recent court filings in a pending divorce case. Among his estranged wife's claims: He'd been creating companies in her name, without her knowledge.\n\nNeither Parnas nor Fruman have previously been charged with crimes. But each has been accused of illegal conduct in civil court filings. Michael King, who alleged Parnas was squatting in his Sunny Isles Beach condo, told police in 2008 he was in fear of Parnas.\n\nA police officer documenting the alleged threat in a report asked King why he was in fear. \"He replied because Parnas told him that he was going to hurt him and that his kids could be hurt as well,\" the report states.\n\nParnas denied making the threat and told police he'd been renting the condo without a lease based on a verbal agreement with King. King obtained an injunction against Parnas, but that was later dismissed due to insufficient evidence, according to a police report and court records.\n\nFruman's estranged wife, Yelyzaveta Naumova, accused him during their divorce proceedings of beating her and possessing a large amount of cocaine and other drugs, which he allegedly wrapped and passed out as party favors.\n\nFruman denied the allegations which he said were only made after he filed a motion to compel his wife to undergo a substance abuse evaluation. Naumova declined to be interviewed by CNN.\n\nParnas and Fruman's rise from South Florida entrepreneurs to major GOP donors and lieutenants of Rudy Giuliani, President Donald Trump's personal attorney, has landed them in the center of a widening criminal investigation. Federal prosecutors charged both men with skirting campaign finance rules to \"buy potential influence\" with US politicians to advance their own interests and those of at least one Ukrainian government official.\n\nThe FBI and prosecutors in New York are now scrutinizing Giuliani's business ties to the men. Giuliani has maintained he's acted appropriately.\n\nThe story of Parnas' and Fruman's unlikely path to becoming subjects of interest in the impeachment inquiry is traced through shell companies, ballooning debts, fraud allegations and interviews with more than a dozen people. There are still unanswered questions about how they bankrolled their journey.\n\nBoth men have pleaded not guilty and were released on bail last month. Each was placed on home confinement and ordered to wear GPS monitors. Outside the federal courthouse in Manhattan, Parnas said, \"Many false things have been said about me and my family in the press and media recently. I look forward to defending myself vigorously in court, and I am certain that in time, the truth will be revealed, and I will be vindicated. In the end, I put my faith in God.\"\n\nEarlier this week, Parnas' lawyers indicated a shift in tactics. Attorney Joseph Bondy said his client would comply with a Congressional subpoena for documents and testimony as part of the impeachment inquiry in a manner that would allow him to protect his Fifth Amendment rights against self-incrimination. Parnas and Fruman initially declined to comply with the subpoena when they were represented by another attorney, John Dowd, who advised Trump during the Special Counsel's investigation. Bondy also challenged Trump's claim that he did not know Parnas.\n\n\"Notwithstanding any of the claims that we have seen to date in the media Lev Parnas is committed to answering Congress' questions truthfully and as completely as possible,\" Bondy said in a statement to CNN. \"It is well settled that people with imperfect backgrounds are nevertheless capable of telling important truths. Indeed these are the types of individuals our government relies on every day in securing indictments and obtaining convictions and there is no reason why Mr Parnas' statements should not be afforded the same degree of deference.\"\n\nFruman's attorney did not respond to CNN's requests for comment.\n\nIt was sometime last year, Giuliani has told CNN, that Parnas and Fruman began introducing him to current and former Ukrainian officials who provided information that Giuliani claims is damaging to some of Trump's political enemies, including former Vice President Joe Biden. Giuliani has not presented any such evidence, and Biden says he's done nothing wrong.\n\nGiuliani has also publicly acknowledged being paid $500,000 by Parnas' company for legal work, but has declined to provide details about the precise services for which he was being paid.\n\nAn attorney for a wealthy Republican donor named Charles Gucciardo told CNN this week that Gucciardo actually paid Giuliani's firm on behalf of Parnas' company.\n\nThe lawyer, Randy Zelin, characterized Gucciardo's payment as an investment in Parnas' company. Zelin said Gucciardo was motivated by business, not politics. The New York Times was the first to report Guicciardo's role in the matter. Gucciardo has not been accused of any wrongdoing.\n\nThe source of campaign donations made by Parnas and Fruman, meanwhile, remains under federal investigation.\n\nFinancial scrutiny is nothing new for Parnas. In the early 2000's, a sister company of the Miami Heat basketball team filed a lawsuit against Parnas' firm Aaron Investment Group for not paying money owed for season tickets and advertising. Parnas told the Miami Herald in 2002 that he believed he was paying first-class prices for second-class service, but a court document shows Parnas' firm subsequently agreed to pay the company $100,000.\n\nIn 2009, a company founded by Parnas, Edgetech, which distributed an Internet-access-device called The Edge, was sued by an investor who accused the company of making \"material misrepresentations and omissions\" about its value and public demand for its product. A federal judge ruled the same year that Edgetech and others \"participated in a scheme to defraud\" the investor and ordered that Edgetech and other defendants pay $336,879.\n\nIn 2014, a landlord sued to evict Parnas and argued he had not paid the $15,000-a-month rent he owed on a Boca Raton, Florida home. A judge later ruled in favor of the landlord.\n\nThe following year, a company sued Parnas and his business partner for owing more than $20,000 on a commercial lease for a property where another Parnas company, Fraud Guarantee, was registered. A court ordered Parnas to pay up.\n\nIn 2016, a federal judge in New York ordered that Parnas pay more than $500,000 to a family trust from which he borrowed money for a movie that never got made. Last month, a judge in Florida gave him thirty days to appear in court and answer questions about the matter.\n\nParnas seemed more flush with cash over the past summer as he was seen surrounded by bodyguards, traveling in luxury SUVs and jetting up and down the East Coast in private chartered planes. He had boasted to friends that his company had been receiving financial backing from Dmytro Firtash, a prominent Ukrainian oligarch who was indicted on bribery and racketeering charges in Chicago six years ago and has been fighting extradition to the US.\n\nParnas played a pivotal role in Firtash's decision to replace his attorney with two well-known Republican lawyers with close ties to Attorney General William Barr and Trump's legal team, a source with direct knowledge of the situation told CNN.\n\nFirtash maintains his innocence. His lawyers downplayed his relationship with Parnas, whom they described as a translator.\n\nFruman, meanwhile, presented himself as the CEO of companies in the US and abroad. An online brochure described him as the head of the Ukraine-based Otrada Luxury Group, a holding company with assets that included a five-star hotel, a luxury car dealership, and \"fine boutiques in the nation's major cities.\"\n\nIn a 2017 financial declaration for his divorce, Fruman said he was earning $276,000 a year as the CEO of a New York-based firm called FD Import & Export Corp. Fruman's brother, Steve, was listed in regulatory filings as a vice president of the company, which is the parent corporation of Otrada Luxury Group.\n\nA webpage for FD Import & Export, no longer online but archived last year, described the company as \"Nestle's largest distributor in Ukraine with excellent corporate relations.\"\n\nA Nestle spokesperson told CNN that Nestle has not done any direct business with FD Import & Export. \"Nestl\u00e9 Ukraine did not have and doesn't have a cooperation with the company.\"\n\nFD Import & Export also promoted its distribution of a milk-canning company's products. Ukrainian news sites reported that company, the Balta Dairy and Canning Plant, co-owned by Fruman, stopped operating and was declared bankrupt in 2012.\n\nNonetheless, prosecutors say that $21 million passed through FD Import & Export over the past three years and that there were substantial financial resources that Fruman didn't disclose to authorities.\n\nAt a bond hearing in federal court in New York on Friday, prosecutor Nicolas Roos handed the judge and Fruman's lawyer a photocopy of a brochure on Otrada Luxury Group. Fruman, the prosecutor said, \"could return to Ukraine where he is politically connected and can decide never to come back here and live a very nice life.\"\n\nThough Fruman's complete financial picture remains unclear, the $3 million loan he and his brother took out on the Bal Harbour condo\u2014that the pair bought together in 2007\u2014appears to have been the funds Fruman and Parnas used to underwrite their generous donations to Republican causes.\n\nThe Frumans sought a private loan outside of the traditional banking route in the spring of 2018.\n\nBy seeking a so-called hard money loan, they were able to close on it more quickly than a bank loan that is subject to lengthy due diligence checks that could take one to two months to close. The loan terms were in the lenders' favor: The condo used to secure the loan was valued far more than the $3 million loan and the interest of nine percent well exceeded bank interest rates. If the brothers failed to pay back the loan, the lenders could foreclose on the property. The lenders, a Ukrainian couple and their son-in-law, did not know the identity of the borrowers and don't appear to be of interest to investigators.\n\nOver seven days in May 2018, the Frumans closed on the $3 million loan and the proceeds appear to have been quickly distributed.\n\nA previous $1.5 million loan on the condo was paid off and another $1.26 million was wired into the Aaron Investments account run by Parnas, according to incorporation documents and bank records obtained by the movie investor who sued Parnas.\n\nThe bank records show that within three days more than half of the $1.26 million was wired out. About $503,000 was sent in two transactions to FD Import Export, the company run by Fruman and his brother, and $205,000 transferred to Lsdama LLC, a company set up by Parnas and his wife.\n\nThe largest donation \u2013 and the one that would ultimately trigger scrutiny \u2013 was $325,000 wired to the pro-Trump super Pac. Other large transfers were made but the bank statements don't indicate who received the money.\n\nProsecutors allege Parnas and Fruman created a shell company to \"conceal from third parties, including creditors, their sources of funding and capital.\"\n\nAfter the loan the political donations continued. One lawmaker who benefited was Congressman Pete Sessions, the Republican from Texas. Parnas and Fruman first met Sessions at an event sponsored by a political action committee, according to the indictment, and committed to raise $20,000 for the Texas lawmaker. Parnas later met with Sessions and \"sought\" his assistance in causing the removal of Marie Yovanovitch, the then-US ambassador to Ukraine, prosecutors allege.\n\nParnas told the New Yorker that he met with Sessions to discuss a natural gas project.\n\nSessions told BuzzFeed in July that he raised Yovanovitch in the meeting, not Parnas and Fruman. \"I sought their input,\" he said.\n\nThe same day as the meeting Sessions wrote to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo arguing for the removal of Yovanovitch in part because of allegations that she had criticized Trump and was disloyal. She was eventually recalled. Prosecutors allege Parnas' efforts were made in part at the request of a Ukrainian government official.\n\nSessions has not been accused of any wrongdoing. He has said, \"I could not have had any knowledge of the scheme described in the indictment or have involvement or coordination of it.\" Sessions was subpoenaed for documents and information after Parnas and Fruman were arrested. His spokesman said he is cooperating.\n\nOne high-ranking Republican operative who spent time with Parnas and Fruman said the pair presented themselves as businessman who \"loved the President and what he's doing.\"\n\nA vetting process \"didn't find any reason why we shouldn't take their money \u2013 so we did,\" said the source who asked not to be named, citing the ongoing criminal investigation.\n\n\"I was shocked to see that these guys got arrested,\" the source said."

He reached a deal over the past few weeks with Simon & Schuster, according to three publishing officials with knowledge of negotiations. The officials were not authorized to discuss the deal publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity.\n\nTwo of the officials said the deal was worth about $2 million. Bolton was represented by the Javelin literary agency, whose clients include former FBI Director James Comey and the anonymous Trump administration official whose book, \"A Warning,\" comes out Nov. 19.\n\nThe publishing officials did not know the title or release date. Simon & Schuster declined comment Saturday and Javelin did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Bolton's 2007 book, \"Surrender is Not an Option: Defending America at the United Nations and Abroad,\" was published by the conservative Simon & Schuster imprint Threshold Editions.\n\nBolton's name has come up often recently during the House impeachment inquiry , which has focused on Trump's pressure on Ukraine to investigate potential 2020 election rival Joe Biden, the former vice president.\n\nIn a transcript of a closed-door interview released Friday, a former national security official described how Bolton had \"immediately stiffened\" as Ambassador Gordon Sondland \"blurted out\" that he had worked out a trade \u2014 Ukrainians' probe for an Oval Office welcome for Ukraine's new president \u2014 with Trump's acting chief of staff, Mick Mulvaney.\n\nFiona Hill said Bolton later told her that \"I am not part of whatever drug deal Sondland and Mulvaney are cooking up\" and asked her to relay that message to a White House lawyer.\n\nMeanwhile, a letter from Bolton's attorney to the top lawyer for the House alleges that Bolton was \"part of many relevant meetings and conversations\" pertaining to the House impeachment inquiry of Trump that are not yet public.\n\nThe attorney, Charles Cooper, suggests Bolton will appear before Congress only if a judge orders him to do so.\n\nAppointed in April 2018, Bolton was Trump's third national security adviser and is known for advocating military action abroad, a viewpoint Trump has resisted. In a speech in late September to the Center for Strategic and International Studies, given after he left the administration, Bolton offered a far more aggressive approach to North Korea's nuclear program than the one advocated by Trump, who has spoken warmly about North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.\n\n\"Every day that goes by makes North Korea a more dangerous country,\" Bolton said. \"You don't like their behavior today, what do you think it will be when they have nuclear weapons that can be delivered to American cities?\""

        "text": "Projecting unusual calm in the middle of a political firestorm, President Trump pleaded ignorance Wednesday about the first public impeachment hearing, unexpectedly insisting that he really wasn't paying attention to sworn testimony in the House Intelligence Committee that could determine whether he serves out his term in office.\nThe disclaimer might be more credible if Trump hadn't already tweeted or retweeted about the hearing 34 times earlier in the day \u2014 including mocking the Democrats' use of what he called \"television lawyers\" to help question witnesses.\n\nKnown for his addiction to cable television, the former reality TV star-turned-president insisted he didn't watch the historic hearing \"for one minute,\" suggesting he was more focused on weightier matters of statecraft.\n\n\"I hear it's a joke,\" Trump said at a joint news conference in the White House East Room with the visiting president of Turkey, Recep Tayyip Erdogan. \"I've been with the president, which is much more important.\"\n\nAsked about the first day's ostensible bombshell \u2014 the disclosure by William B. Taylor Jr., the acting ambassador to Ukraine, that one of his aides had personally heard Trump discuss his demand for investigations of Democrats on a cellphone call to an official in Kyiv \u2014 Trump professed bewilderment.\n\n\"I know nothing about that,\" Trump said. \"First time I've heard of it.\"\n\nTrump's casual, almost breezy dismissal suggested he and his aides were adjusting to the new public phase of the impeachment inquiry by, at least for now, casting the proceedings as boring.\n\nToo boring, he seemed eager to convey, to merit any of his time.\n\nHis mild comments came as a surprise if only because Trump is not known for message discipline, and normally spews his anger or disdain with relentless 140-character certainty. Indeed, several hours earlier he had accused his accusers \u2014 Taylor and George Kent, an assistant secretary of State, the first two witnesses \u2014 of being \"NEVER TRUMPERS.\"\n\nAsked about Trump's tweet in the hearing, both diplomats denied that characterization, describing themselves as nonpartisan career professionals who had served for decades under both Republican and Democratic presidents.\n\nEmbracing Turkey's autocratic leader at the White House while lawmakers at the other end of Pennsylvania Avenue focused on Trump's apparent efforts to force Ukraine to investigate his political foes by freezing U.S. military aid \u2014 a move that could benefit another autocrat, Russian President Vladimir Putin \u2014 provided a strong symbolic subtext to the day's events.\n\nBut Trump's stoic efforts to appear preoccupied with foreign affairs, however controversial Erdogan might be, and unaffected by the impeachment hearings that garnered wall-to-wall TV and radio coverage, served a strategic purpose, according to a Republican official familiar with the White House game plan.\n\n\"If you watch the hearings and you believe these witnesses are ultimately credible, that could be a problem\" for Trump, the official said, speaking on condition of anonymity. \"If you're convinced it's boring, maybe you don't watch as much, which is what we'd prefer.\"\n\nRepublicans, ironically, had clamored for public hearings ever since House Democrats began closed-door hearings on Oct. 1 to take sworn depositions. Many of those witnesses are now scheduled to testify in public.\n\nBut when GOP lawmakers finally got their chance to question witnesses in public, Rep. Devin Nunes, (R-Tulare), the committee's top Republican, derided the hearing as a made-for-television \"drama,\" dismissing the probe as \"the low-rent Ukrainian sequel\" after \"the main performance, the Russia hoax, has ended.\"\n\nNumerous GOP lawmakers pointed out that the two diplomats didn't have firsthand knowledge of Trump's now-infamous July 25 phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, looking to dismiss their testimony as hearsay.\n\nAt his news conference, Trump made the same point \u2014 even as he insisted he had not watched the testimony.\n\n\"They said it's all third-hand information, nothing direct at all,\" Trump said.\n\nStill, the diplomats' testimony offered a detailed and damning picture of a president putting his personal political interests at the center of U.S. relations with Ukraine, a struggling European democracy that is under siege by Russian-backed troops.\n\nTrump mostly sought to avoid the subject of the hearings during his afternoon news conference, which began an hour late and only after the six-hour hearing on Capitol Hill had wrapped up.\n\nBut he was asked about it. Standing stiffly and speaking in a measured tone, Trump expressed his desire to reveal the identity of the whistleblower whose Sept. 12 complaint sparked the inquiry, and to investigate the intelligence community's inspector general, who validated the complaint as credible and urgent.\n\n\"This is a sham. It shouldn't be allowed,\" Trump said. \"It was a situation that was caused by people that shouldn't have allowed it to happen. I want to find out who is the whistleblower.\"\n\nHe added, \"I want to find out ... why would [the inspector general] have presented that?\"\n\nErdogan made a point of criticizing the Democrat-led House \u2014 a brazen move for a foreign leader at a podium in the White House \u2014 for approving a resolution condemning the century-old mass killings of Armenians by Ottoman Turks as a genocide.\n\nHe said he hoped the GOP-run Senate \"will take the United States out of this vicious cycle.\"\n\nTrump praised Erdogan, calling him a \"great friend.\"\n\nTrump had told reporters around noon that he was \"too busy\" to watch the hearing, but he then took a shot at Daniel Goldman, a former federal prosecutor from New York who questioned the witnesses on behalf of Democrats.\n\n\"I see they're using lawyers that are television lawyers \u2014 they took some guys off television,\" he said. \"You know, I'm not surprised to see it, because [Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam B. Schiff (D-Burbank)] can't do his own questions.\"\n\nAfter weeks of White House denials that it needed a \"war room\" to coordinate a response, Trump reelection campaign officials, Republican lawmakers and other backers appeared to operate off similar talking points, tweeting comments that sought to poke holes in the Democrats' case.\n\nWhite House Press Secretary Stephanie Grisham dismissed the proceeding as \"boring\" and \"a colossal waste of taxpayer time & money.\"\n\nTrump's reelection campaign blasted out a fundraising email as the House proceeding began, seeking to raise $3 million over 24 hours and dismissing the impeachment inquiry as an unwarranted partisan attempt to take down the president. The letter, signed by Trump, was blunt.\n\n\"It's obvious they hate me,\" he wrote to supporters. \"But more importantly, they HATE YOU.\""

        "text": "Wisconsin legislators struggled Wednesday with a bill that would force schools to teach cursive writing, questioning whether they should make teachers spend time and money preserving the centuries-old style in today's computerized word.\n\nRepublican Rep. Jeremy Thiesfeldt, a former teacher, introduced the bill in September.\n\nThe measure would require schools that receive state dollars to include cursive in their elementary curriculum with the goal of having students write legibly in cursive by the end of fifth grade.\n\nCursive, known for its distinctive loops and curlicues, has largely been relegated to writing thank-you notes and credit card receipts over the last 20 years.\n\nBut it's been making a comeback recently; at least 10 other states have included cursive requirements in their state education standards.\n\nThiesfeldt's bill wouldn't come cheap, at least according to state education officials.\n\nThe Department of Public Instruction estimates public and charter schools would have to spend between $1.7 million to $5.95 million on student materials such as workbooks annually and between $250,000 and $1.6 million on teacher training in at least the first year of the requirement.\n\nVoucher schools would face costs of up to $595,000 annually for materials and up to $160,000 on teacher training in the first year.\n\nThiesfeldt tried to make a case for the measure during a public hearing in front of the Assembly state affairs committee Wednesday afternoon.\n\nHe said studies have shown writing in cursive fosters neurological connections in students' brains, improves retention and can help dyslexic children read because cursive letters are more distinctive than printed letters.\n\n\"This bill isn't just about nostalgia or being able to read grandmas' letters and primary source historical documents,\" Thiesfeldt said.\n\nKrista Huerta, an occupational therapist and handwriting specialist in the Delavan-Darien School District, told the committee that she spent three years working with a student who couldn't write or type her own name.\n\nNow the student writes in cursive \"without hesitation,\" saying cursive is calming and lets her get her thoughts out faster.\n\n\"This basic foundational skill has facilitated closing a learning gap for this student,\" Huerta said. \"(Cursive) is a gift to our future generations.\"\n\nBut committee members sounded skeptical.\n\nRep. Marisabel Cabrera, a Milwaukee Democratic, asked Thiesfeldt for copies of the studies he mentioned.\n\nHe didn't have any to show the committee but told Cabrera they're not hard to find with Google.\n\nRep. Christine Sinicki, another Milwaukee Democrat, said teachers in her district have balked at the bill's cost. Other members said they were uncomfortable with handing schools another unfunded mandate.\n\n\"My concern still is we keep adding these state things that we think should be taught in schools,\" Republican Rep. Tyler Vorpagel said. \"I just struggle with again adding another mandate from us on top of what we already do.\"\n\nDPI officials submitted written testimony arguing the bill would overwrite local school boards' ability to set their own curriculum.\n\nThey also pointed out that cursive could present a challenge for disabled students.\n\nDan Rossmiller is a lobbyist for the Wisconsin Association of School Boards, which opposes the bill.\n\nHe said the bill erodes local boards' ability to set their own curriculum.\n\nPutting together coherent sentences and spelling correctly are more important than the format, he argued.\n\nEmployers these days ask applicants whether they can use Microsoft Word or Excel, not whether they can write in cursive, he said.\n\n\"This is probably a case of micromanagement by the state,\" Rossmiller said. \"Are we teaching something that is a necessary component of being an educated person in the 21st century? Society is moving forward and some things we thought were essential skills may not be essential skills.\"\n\nSinicki observed that the bill's chief Senate sponsor, Republican Luther Olsen, submitted written testimony in a cursive font that he composed on a computer."

        "text": "House Intelligence Chair Adam Schiff strongly signaled that Democrats would focus their impeachment case against President Donald Trump around a \"bribery\" charge.\n\nAccording to audio in a new NPR interview, Schiff  argued that the Founders had a \"broader\" definition of bribery that included abuse of power and breach of the public trust by elected officials, suggesting that it would be the central crime in the \"high crimes and misdemeanors\" specified by the Constitution for impeachment of a president.\n\"As the Founders understood bribery, it was not as we understand it in law today. It was much broader,\" Schiff told NPR. \"It connoted the breach of the public trust in a way where you're offering official acts for some personal or political reason, not in the nation's interest.\"\n\nSchiff went on to explain that he believes the public investigation of potential 2020 rival Joe Biden, which multiple Trump administration witnesses have confirmed the White House pushed to obtain from Ukrainian authorities, is the \"something of value\" to satisfy the bribery charge.\n\nHe also disputed the Republican rebuttal that Trump never got what he wanted from Ukraine.\n\"When you consider the serious terms of whether the president has committed an impeachable offense, the fact that the scheme was discovered, the fact that the scheme was unsuccessful, doesn't make it any less odious or any less impeachable,\" Schiff argued. \"If the president solicited for help in the U.S. election, if the president conditioned official acts on the performance of these political favors, whether Ukraine ever had to go through with it really doesn't matter. What matters is: Did the president attempt to commit acts that ought to result in his removal from office?\""

        "text": "Dean Preston, a tenants rights activist, squeaked out a victory against the appointed incumbent in San Francisco's District Five Saturday \u2014 a significant win that deals a major blow to Mayor London Breed and will likely bolster the progressives on the Board of Supervisors.\n\nPreston had a 170-vote lead over Supervisor Vallie Brown in the ranked-choice totals, Saturday, with only a handful of the votes left to count. Now, Preston will represent a diverse collection of neighborhoods that includes the Fillmore, Western Addition, Haight-Ashbury, Hayes Valley and the Inner Sunset.\n\nAlthough Brown finished with 67 more first-place votes than Preston, he collected enough second-choice votes to pull out the win.\n\n\"Our campaign was very clearly challenging the status quo,\" Preston said in a phone interview Saturday, sounding breathless and jubilant. \"We won in a low turn-out election with that message \u2014 I think it makes a statement.\"\n\nHe's the first democratic socialist to be elected supervisor since Harry Britt won the same district in 1979.\n\nBrown didn't immediately concede Saturday evening. Her campaign consultant, Leo Wallach, said his team was \"still evaluating the results, and making sure everything is 100 percent resolved.\"\n\nEven though he won Tuesday, he will need to quickly prove himself: Preston will have to run again in November 2020, as he is filling out the rest of the term for Breed, who vacated the seat when she became mayor.\n\n\"What is missing in so many campaigns is a vision of what this town could be if we did not surrender to the darkest forces of capitalism and neo-liberalism,\" Preston said at his campaign party at Hayes Valley wine bar Tuesday night. \"We are going to change (this town) with mass mobilization, democratic socialism and fearless advocacy for the things we know are right.\"\n\nPreston only narrowly lost the seat in 2016 to Breed, the former district supervisor. He had an early, aggressive entry into the race and has been fundraising and campaigning since the mayor appointed Brown to the seat in July 2018.\n\nPreston, originally from New York, has lived in District Five for 20 years and owns a home on Alamo Square. He is widely known for writing Proposition F, the June 2018 ballot measure that gives tenants facing eviction the right to a lawyer. He also created and ran Tenants Together, a statewide renters' rights group, in 2008. He took a leave of absence as executive director to run for office.\n\nHis addition will tilt the already-progressive-leaning board even further to the left. Breed has already run into challenges with progressive supervisors during her year plus in office. Preston is seen as an adversary to Breed and said he will not be afraid to go against her when their priorities don't align.\n\nBrown, on the other hand, was seen as one of Breed's few allies among the 11 supervisors. She was also one of four women on the 11-member board.\n\nPolitical observers say Preston's term will pose a major challenge for Breed, and her ability to push her legislative agenda through during her four-year term.\n\nPreston \"will not only continue the board majority, but replace someone who is a strong ally for the mayor and replace her with someone who is ... more of an opponent,\" said Jason McDaniel, a political scientist at San Francisco State University.\"\n\nHis campaign was backed by several of Brown's colleagues on the board. While many said they liked working with Brown, others said they saw in Preston a more hard-charging supervisor would push for more ambitious legislation.\n\nPreston's win not only has implications for Breed, but also for the future of San Francisco. As a democratic socialist, he ran on a platform of making dramatic, sweeping and immediate change in the city. He will likely champion progressive policies on the Board of Supervisors that seek wholesale change in the city \u2014 like a proposal by two progressive supervisors, Matt Haney and Hillary Ronen, called MentalHealth SF that would revamp the city's mental health care system.\n\nVoters \"sent a clear message with these results,\" Haney said Saturday. \"City Hall should be on notice.\"\n\nHis campaign promises were ambitious. For example, he plans to propose a measure for the March 2020 ballot that would create free Muni service for all, and a plan to build 10,000 units of 100% affordable housing within 10 years.\n\nWhile his supporters appreciated his moxie, his opponents criticized him for being too overzealous and unrealistic. Still, he was able to energize an enthusiastic base and beat out his opponent, who raised slightly more money and was and backed by prominent names in San Francisco politics, such as Breed, state Sen. Scott Wiener, Assemblyman David Chiu and California Sen. Kamala Harris.\n\nBrown received $486,408 in contributions through the end of October, and Preston received $440,932.\n\nPreston rallied the crowded bar of supporters at his campaign party late Tuesday with a rousing speech punctuated by chants of \"Tax the rich\" and \"We're gonna win!\"\n\nJim Ross, a political consultant, always expected the District Five race to be close. But what made it razor thin, he said, was last-minute revelations by the San Francisco Tenants Union \u2014 which endorsed Preston \u2014 that Brown evicted three low-income African American tenants from her Fillmore building. Brown incorrectly said she evicted the tenants because they weren't paying rent and issued a public apology for the misstatement last week.\n\nThose revelations, he said, \"dramatically\" changed the dynamic of the race.\n\n\"It created this real contrast between Vallie Brown and Dean Preston,\" he said. \"He has this whole background as a tenants right advocate, and then Brown was seen as someone who evicts tenants.\"\n\nJon Golinger, a political consultant, said Preston will be a \"game changer\" on the board.\n\n\"He is an organizer,\" he said. \"He will be proposing and driving things on the board ... and District Five will reclaim its spot as one of the most progressive districts in the city.\""

        "text": "President Donald Trump's reelection campaign makes the misleading claim in a TV ad that he is \"cutting illegal immigration in half.\" In fact, apprehensions at the U.S.-Mexico border in fiscal year 2019 were more than double the total in fiscal year 2016 and almost triple the total in fiscal year 2017.\n\nThe Trump campaign apparently based the claim on data showing a significant decline in migrants caught illegally crossing the Southwest border between May and August of this year. But counting apprehensions in just that three-month period amounts to cherry-picking. Measured over a longer period of time, apprehensions under Trump are up instead of down.\n\nThe full 30-second campaign commercial \u2014 a version of which aired nationwide during the final game of the World Series \u2014 attacks Democrats for focusing on \"impeachment and phony investigations\" while Trump is \"changing Washington\" by creating millions of jobs, reducing illegal immigration, and \"obliterating ISIS.\"\n\nA spokesperson did not respond when we asked the campaign how it figures Trump is \"cutting illegal immigration in half,\" as the ad's narrator says.\n\nA version of the ad that aired in Honolulu, Hawaii, on Oct. 30, and was captured by Kantar Media's Campaign Media Analysis Group, does not mention a specific time period or include an on-screen citation. However, a version of the ad shared on Twitter by Trump's 2020 campaign manager, Brad Parscale, uses the same language but includes a graphic that says \"Fox News, 9/10/2019.\"\n\nThat day, acting director of U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services Ken Cuccinelli talked about illegal immigration on \"Fox & Friends\" with host Brian Kilmeade and said: \"The president has literally thrown every domestic and international effort he can at this and it's paid off. As you noted Brian, we are down more than 50% since May in just three months.\"\n\nActually, total Southwest border apprehensions declined by nearly 62% from 132,856 in May to 50,684 in August. Still, that only counts three months of this year. Without that information, viewers of the ad could get the false impression that the TV spot is saying that Trump cut illegal immigration compared to a period before he was president. (The ad's claims that he \"created 6 million new jobs\" and \"500,000 new manufacturing jobs\" are mostly accurate and based on employment data that counts from when Trump took office until now.)\n\nBut as we wrote in \"Trump's Numbers October 2019 Update,\" since Trump entered office in January 2017, \"[i]llegal border crossings nearly doubled, as of the most recent 12 months on record.\" That was based on U.S. Customs and Border Protection data as of August. September data is now available from the U.S. Customs and Border Protection, which allowed us to compare fiscal years for this story \u2014 as illustrated in the chart below. (Note: There are technically no statistics for those who cross the border illegally, but apprehensions by CBP are used to measure such trends.)\n\nIn fiscal year 2019, there were 851,508 total apprehensions, which is the highest since 858,638 in fiscal year 2007.\n\nThe fiscal 2019 total is 115% higher than the 396,579 apprehensions in fiscal year 2018, and 180% higher than the 303,916 apprehensions in fiscal year 2017, which included almost four months of Barack Obama's presidency and over eight months of Trump's.\n\nCompared with the 408,870 apprehensions in fiscal year 2016, the last full fiscal year before Trump took office, apprehensions during the most recent fiscal year were up 108%.\n\nBy all of those measures, border officials are catching more people at the border under Trump \u2014 not fewer."

Regents of the University of California, a case combining several challenges to the Trump administration's decision to cancel the program in September 2017.\n\nDACA remains in effect, for the time being, due to a preliminary injunction issued by a lower court. But the program's supporters aren't feeling overly confident about its prospects.\n\n\"There are more ways for this to go badly than for it to go well,\" said Garrett Epps, a professor of law at the University of Baltimore.\n\nMany of the advocates who had gathered in the nation's capital had a similar feeling of foreboding after the questioning. The Trump administration is arguing that the program is illegal, and also that the decision to end it shouldn't be subject to judicial review.\n\nChief Justice John Roberts, the likely swing vote, had tough questions for the lawyers on both sides. But U.S. Rep. Joaquin Castro, D-San Antonio, chair of the Congresssional Hispanic Caucus, said he's not pinning his hopes on Roberts \u2014 or the court. In a press conference after the arguments, he called on Congress to act to pass legislation to protect Dreamers.\n\nThe program, created by President Barack Obama by executive action in 2012, is a popular one. Polls show an overwhelming majority of Americans agree that the people it protects \u2014 immigrants brought to this country as children \u2014 should be allowed to stay.\n\nBut conservatives have long maintained that DACA itself is an example of unlawful executive overreach, and President Donald Trump agrees. In September 2017, he said he was cancelling DACA because it is \"unlawful and unconstitutional and cannot be successfully defended in court.\"\n\nThe reality is that DACA hasn't been successfully defended in court to date. It just hasn't been successfully challenged in court either. And a program created by executive action can be ended the same way \u2014 at least in theory.\n\n\"If you can proclaim it, why can't you rescind it?\" asked Epps, rhetorically.\n\n\"It's not a bad question,\" he added. Epps thinks Americans who support DACA, as he does, will have to pin their hopes on the justices ruling the Trump administration didn't follow federal law requiring policy changes be done in an orderly way. He cites previous such examples by Trump as the travel ban and the attempt to add a citizenship question to the census.\n\nTo that point: Trump rescinded DACA abruptly, back in 2017, and seemingly without regard for the disruption that might result from such a decision\u2014and its adverse effects on American citizens as well as DACA recipients.\n\nThe costs of ending DACA would be considerable, even if you're only thinking coldly about the bottom line. The Houston Hispanic Chamber of Commerce, in a brief filed last year, argues that ending the program would cost about $6 billion a year \u2014 $2 billion in the Houston area alone \u2014 to Texas' annual gross domestic product. Texas is home to roughly 109,000 DACA recipients.\n\nAnd although Trump has occasionally expressed sympathy for those Americans\u2014who are American in every sense except not having arrived here legally \u2014 it would seem that the immigration hawks in the administration have been whispering in his ear.\n\n\"Many of the people in DACA, no longer very young, are far from \"angels,\" Trump tweeted Tuesday. \"Some are very tough, hardened criminals.\"\n\n\"President Obama said he had no legal right to sign order, but would anyway,\" the president continued. \"If Supreme Court remedies with overturn, a deal will be made with Dems for them to stay!\"\n\nUnder the terms of the program, as laid out in a 2012 Department of Homeland Security memorandum, individuals who have been convicted of a felony or significant misdemeanor are ineligible for its protections.\n\nAnd it's hard to believe that Republicans in Congress would respond to such a Supreme Court \"remedy\" by making a deal with Democrats to protect the Dreamers from deportation. In theory, they could have done so already \u2014 or before the Supreme Court issues its ruling on the consolidated case it heard this week.\n\nAs Castro noted, a bill that would provide Dreamers with a path to legal status, the American Dream and Promise Act of 2019, passed the House on a mostly party-line vote in June, but it has yet to be taken up in the Senate.\n\nIt's as if the measure has been stuffed into a cobwebbed closet in Majority Leader Mitch McConnell's office, along with various other pieces of potentially worthwhile and broadly popular legislation.\n\nAs Americans we've become used to the dysfunction and gridlock in our nation's capital, but we shouldn't become resigned to it\u2014or forget that there are lives, families, and communities at stake.\n\n\"These DACA recipients aren't just students. They're our families, they're business owners, they're homeowners, they're our neighbors,\" said U.S. Rep. Ruben Gallego, a Democrat who represents Arizona's 7th Congressional District, after the oral arguments concluded.\n\n\"This administration has purposely put them in a position that I think is something we don't want to see. He's using them as leverage for some greater immigration game,\" Gallego continued.\n\nRepublicans might argue that Obama did the same. But the partisan bickering on both sides misses the point \u2014 that Dreamers shouldn't be in such a precarious position in the first place."

        "text": "Hundreds of people lined up Monday afternoon at a Costco in north Scottsdale where Donald Trump Jr. was holding a book signing event. \n\nWhile store members were invited to attend the event, members of the media were not allowed inside nor were they allowed to conduct interviews on the business' grounds at 15255 N. Hayden Road, according to Costco employees outside of the event Monday afternoon. \n\nKimberly Guilfoyle, Trump Jr.'s girlfriend and a senior adviser for President Donald Trump's reelection campaign, also was expected to attend the event, which was meant to promote Trump Jr.'s new book, \"Triggered: How the Left Thrives on Hate and Wants to Silence Us.\"\n\nAbout a dozen protesters lined the sidewalks outside the Costco parking lot, where some expressed disappointment at Costco for hosting the event at its store and contempt for Trump's presidency. \n\nJoan Petty, who holds a Costco shopping membership, said the company is not typically known to be political. \n\n\"Costco, in its infinite wisdom, allowed somebody who is campaigning for the treasonous president to sign a book here in Scottsdale, and yes it (Arizona) may be a red state but Costco has previously not done that to my knowledge and I'm offended with Costco,\" she said. \n\nCostco employees outside the event declined to comment. \n\nMonday's event wasn't the first booking signing event by a political figure to be held at a Costco, with at least one prominent example involving a Democrat. In 2014, Hillary Clinton held a book signing event at a Costco warehouse in Virginia to promote her then-new book, \"Hard Choices.\" \n\nThe company's customer service website says it does not take positions on social issues, is not involved in partisan politics and does not contribute money to political candidates or issues. \n\n\"When you visit a Costco warehouse, we want you to feel welcome. And, after gathering much feedback, we have found that the majority of our members appreciate the fact that our atmosphere is devoid of politics \u2014so we strive to keep it that way,\" the website states. \"Your comfort and satisfaction is our No. 1 priority.\"\n\nDee Dee Jones, who was among Trump supporters counterprotesting Monday in front of the store's parking lot, said she does not believe Costco was making a political statement but rather a business decision. \n\n\"They (Costco) knew it would draw people, it'd make money, it would sell books, I don't think it's a political position,\" she said. \n\nAn online invitation that advertised the event, which has since been taken down, said Trump Jr.'s book had to be purchased from the Scottsdale Costco in order to be signed. \n\nAccording to Jones, the event sold out before she could secure a spot, which is why she hit the sidewalks to show support for the GOP's cause, people and the country. \n\n\"We're all just common people who are Trump supporters and happy with the job he's doing; (he's) not a perfect person, none of us are, but he's keeping his promises,\" she said. \n\nSome of the protesters and counterprotesters engaged in heated discussions over various political topics, including the current impeachment inquiry, the identity of the whistleblower that triggered the inquiry and immigration policy."

        "text": "President Donald Trump's longtime friend and onetime campaign adviser, Roger Stone, was convicted in the only remaining case from special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation.\n\nJurors have returned a guilty verdict on all of seven counts including five counts of lying to Congress, one count of witness tampering and one count of obstruction of a proceeding. Stone had pleaded not guilty and maintained his innocence throughout his trial in Washington, DC.\n\nProsecutors asked that Stone be remanded pending sentencing, citing his issues with abiding by court orders since his indictment. Stone's defense pushed back, arguing he has not broken the condition of his release.\n\nStone's sworn testimony in September 2017 before the House Intelligence Committee forms the basis for most of the charges in his seven-count indictment, which includes allegations he misled the committee on several key elements of their probe. Stone was also charged with witness tampering by urging his former associate, Randy Credico, to exercise his Fifth Amendment rights before the committee.\n\nWith the closure of Stone's case, so ended another chapter in the special counsel's investigation. Robert Mueller and his team of prosecutors investigated Russian interference during the 2016 election and President Trump's efforts to undermine their probe for nearly two years.\n\nMueller brought the charges against Stone in January. Stone pleaded not guilty to them all, and once vowed he would be \"vindicated\" at trial.\n\nShortly after Stone's conviction, President Trump responded on Twitter, \"So they now convict Roger Stone of lying and want to jail him for many years to come. Well, what about Crooked Hillary, Comey, Strzok, Page, McCabe, Brennan, Clapper, Shifty Schiff, Ohr & Nellie, Steele & all of the others, including even Mueller himself? Didn't they lie? ....A double standard like never seen before in the history of our Country?\"\n\nNone of the above mentioned individuals have been charged with lying under oath as Stone was, but a Department of Justice Inspector General report from last year about the firing of FBI's former deputy director Andrew McCabe accused McCabe of \"lacking candor\" in interviews under oath with federal investigators.\n\nIn effect, the special counsel's probe culminated in a 448-page report made public in March. But Stone's case has remained a loose thread stemming from the nearly two-year investigation.\n\nTo that end, the trial of Roger Stone has introduced several new pieces of information about what the special counsel examined as part of its probe, including the most detailed view to date of how the Trump campaign responded to WikiLeaks' role in disseminating information hacked by the Russians.\n\nFormer Trump campaign CEO Steve Bannon, who took the stand last week, described Stone as the Trump campaign's unofficial \"access point\" to WikiLeaks. Rick Gates, the onetime Trump campaign deputy chairman, testified Tuesday about how the campaign responded to information Stone provided them about WikiLeaks, including multiple senior-level \"brainstorming\" sessions on a number of matters, including how the campaign would respond to future Wikileaks document dumps.\n\n\"The campaign was in a state of happiness\" when WikiLeaks published hacked emails from the Democratic National Committee in July 2016, Gates said. \"Any time you're in a campaign and damaging information comes out about your competitor, it's helpful.\"\n\nGates, who pleaded guilty to charges brought by Mueller's office, has been a central cooperating witness for the special counsel's team.\n\nGates testified that his boss at the time, former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort, instructed him to keep in touch with Stone so that the campaign, and the candidate himself, could be kept abreast of WikiLeaks' activities. Gates also recalled overhearing a phone call between Stone and then-candidate Trump on July 31, 2016, after which Trump told him \"more information would be coming.\"\n\nProsecutors showed an email from Stone to Gates requesting contact information for Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner, then a senior adviser to the campaign, one day after news broke that the Democratic National Committee's server had been hacked by Russians in June of 2016.\n\nProsecutors did not allege that Stone and Kushner ever actually met.\n\nStone's trial was punctuated by an appearance from New York-based comedian and radio host Randy Credico, whose testimony included references to 1950s-era television advertisements and impressions of presidential candidate Bernie Sanders. The most damning charge Stone faced was witness tampering in connection to his interactions with Credico, who he told congressional investigators was his conduit to WikiLeaks.\n\nStone's sentencing is scheduled for Feb. 6, 2020, just over a year after his dawn arrest on Jan. 25 of this year. He faces up to 50 years in prison according to the statutory maximum, but legal experts have told ABC News the actual sentence is likely going to be much lower.\n\nEarlier this year, just days after Stone was indicted, President Trump said in an interview with CBS' Face the Nation that he has not thought about pardoning Stone.\n\n\"I have not thought about it. It looks like he's defending himself very well,\" Trump said when asked about the possibility of Stone's pardon.\n\nThe president also attempted to downplay his connections to Stone during the interview, saying Stone \"didn't work on the campaign, except way, way at the beginning long before we're talking about,\" though he added, \"Roger is somebody I've always liked.\""

        "title": "One sister has DACA status, the other doesn't. Their lives are worlds apart.",
        "text": "Sisters Deysi and Fatima Perez Avila both came to the United States from Mexico as little girls.\nDeysi was 9 and Fatima was 5 when they moved to New Jersey, where their family settled in Red Bank, a town known for its trendy stores and art scene, just a few miles from the Jersey Shore. \nIt was in Red Bank where Deysi and Fatima learned English, made new friends and learned to love the United States as their own, even though they were living in an adopted land as undocumented immigrants.\nThen, in 2012, the sisters' experiences as immigrants without legal status took dramatically different courses.\nThat's when Deysi turned 16 and became eligible for a program that temporarily shielded her \u2014 and other undocumented immigrants who came to the country as children \u2014 from deportation. The program, known as Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA, allowed Deysi to get a part-time job that paid more than the minimum wage. And just like her friends, Deysi was also able to experience another American rite of passage and get her driver's license when she turned 17. \n\"Even right now, I'm the only one that drives,'' said Deysi, 22. \"After I got my DACA, I got to work right away, so it meant I got to help my family even more.\" \nIt was not the same for Fatima, a senior at Red Bank Regional High School, who celebrated her 17th birthday over the summer. Last year, when Fatima would have been eligible to apply for the DACA program, it was no longer available to new applicants. \n\"I'm over here, on the sidelines, and feeling helpless because I can't really drive even though I really want to,'' she said. \"Same thing with jobs. Once my peers started getting jobs, again, I was on the sidelines, again feeling hopeless, like I didn't have anything to do to help out my family \u2026 even if they just needed a simple ride.\"\nThe federal government stopped processing new DACA applications in 2017 after the Trump administration announced it planned to rescind the program. The announcement led advocates and several states to file lawsuits challenging the move, and federal courts ordered that two-year DACA renewals be processed \u2014 but not new applications.\nOn Tuesday, the U.S. Supreme Court hears arguments on whether the administration's attempt to end the program was legal. The court should issue its decision by spring \u2014 a ruling that will determine the fate of more than 660,000 current DACA holders like Deysi, and whether others, including Fatima, will be able to apply.\n\"DACA has accomplished far more than affording deferred prosecutorial action,'' reads a brief filed with the Supreme Court by United We Dream, a national immigrant youth-led organization. \"It has created life-changing opportunities for hundreds of thousands of promising young people. DACA has allowed them to lead fuller and more vibrant lives, including by seizing opportunities to advance their education, furthering their careers, providing critical help to their families, and giving back to their communities.\"\nOpponents of the program have said President Barack Obama overstepped his authority when he issued the executive order creating DACA in 2012. They argue that the courts ruled in the past that Congress, not the president, has authority to enact immigration laws and policies \n\"If the court forces the executive to maintain such a lawless program, it will have fundamentally and forever altered the manner in which immigration policy is set in this country,'' Ken Paxton, the attorney general of Texas, argues in a brief filed with the Supreme Court. Texas is one of several states that want the program to be terminated.\nJohn Miano, a New Jersey-based attorney who represents Save Jobs USA, an organization composed of former information technology workers from California who claim they were replaced by foreign workers,  said he doesn't feel DACA has a chance of surviving. \n\"There are so many legal problems with it,'' said Miano, who also filed an amicus brief on behalf of Save Jobs USA. \"DACA is something that should have gone through public notice and comment, and it didn't go through that, so it was illegal in the first place.\"\nHome is here\nIn the weeks leading up to the Supreme Court's Tuesday hearing, advocacy groups across the country kicked off campaigns to draw attention to the plight of so-called Dreamers, many of whom have lived and attended schools in the United States for years.\nOn Friday, undocumented immigrants across the country walked out of class to let the \"Supreme Court know that Dreamers' home is here,\" according to United We Dream. The hashtag  #homeishere has been circulating on social media.\nAnd last week, about 200 people, including many DACA recipients, began a walk from New York City to Washington. The walkers plan to be on the court steps Tuesday to voice their support for DACA before oral arguments begin. \nDeysi will be among the Dreamers at the courthouse. \n\"I'm definitely nervous about what they have to say,'' Deysi said. \"I'm going with a couple of friends and people that I know. We are all in it together, and I'm just hoping for the best.\" \nDeysi applied for DACA in 2012. Like other applicants who received DACA, she had to show that she had arrived in the United States before the age of 16, that she was enrolled in school, and that she had not been convicted of a felony, a significant misdemeanor or multiple misdemeanors. She also had to show that she had been in the country for more than five years.\nDeysi, a fine arts student at Brookdale Community College who creates portraits using oil paint, said she dreams of getting an associate's degree and pursuing a career in the arts. \nFatima also plans to register at Brookdale next school year after high school graduation. She said she wants to pursue a degree in education and become a teacher. \n\"A preschool teacher,'' she said. \"I want to be able to give back.\"\nBoth sisters work while they go to school, but their experiences have been different when looking for jobs.\nDeysi has held several positions since she received her work permit under the DACA program. Her first job as a dietary aide paid her $8.25 an hour, and she held the position for several years. Her second job was as a cashier at A.C. Moore, an arts and crafts retailer. She now works at a bakery, where she takes orders and decorates cakes. In all those jobs, she filled out an application, and has paid taxes and contributed to Social Security, she said.\nEven though Fatima doesn't have a work permit, she has been able to land jobs that pay her in cash. She worked at a pizza restaurant for a few months, and said she now works as a beauty salon receptionist. She has never had to fill out an application for the positions, she said. \nSince she doesn't drive, Fatima depends on friends and her sister to give her rides. Deysi, a co-vice president of a Dreamers+ club at her college, has been more active in immigration rights activities, while Fatima has been less so, though she did accompany Deysi to a rally in Washington, D.C., in March. \n\"I wanted her to have that experience of being able to go to Washington,\" Deysi said of her sister. \"I took her once, and she probably never thought she was going to go.''\nTheir mother, Maria Avila, said she is proud of her daughters, but that she has been concerned for Fatima, especially when she attended the rally in Washington. \n\"The way things are here, I couldn't help but worry,'' said Avila, 48. \"I was really scared, but I left it to God, and I told her to be careful, and she said she had to go to push for DACA, because she really wants it.\" \nAvila said she and her husband migrated north for various reasons, especially to give her three daughters, including a 5-year-old U.S. citizen, better opportunities. She said she often talks to Fatima about her dreams of working and teaching. \n\"Sometimes I just don't know what to tell her,'' Avila said. \"I wish I could change things for her, but with so many laws, we have to rely on God and pray that she will have DACA one day.\"\nDACA:Two years after Trump administration rescinded DACA, recipients await SCOTUS ruling\nTheir futures at stake:As Supreme Court takes up Trump plan to end DACA, American dreams at stake for nearly 700,000 immigrants\nImmigration lawyer:My DACA clients can't rely on Trump or Supreme Court. Where's Congress?\nDeysi said she doesn't like to talk to her sister about the differences in their lives because she feels bad that Fatima doesn't have DACA status.\n\"It makes me feel guilty,'' Deysi said, choking back tears. \"It makes me feel really emotional and just, I guess, helpless.\"\nDeysi said she does not want to think about life without DACA.\n\"I know I would feel lost if it was taken away, but at the same time, I know I can't let that get me down,'' she said. \"As long as there is a will there is a way. That is what my mom says, and I believe that is true.\"\n"

        "text": "When Brazil's far-right President Jair Bolsonaro traveled to New York for the United Nations General Assembly in September, he was recovering from surgery and reportedly left after 30 hours without having met with any heads of state.\n\nDespite the brevity of his trip, Bolsonaro did make time to meet with someone who occupies a special position within President Donald Trump's inner circle \u2013 Rudy Giuliani.\n\nThe meeting, which involved a discussion of security and Brazil's prison system, according to a tweet by Bolsonaro's son who also attended, was just one in a series of interactions Giuliani has had with foreign leaders since he began representing Trump as his personal attorney last year.\n\nGiuliani has met or communicated with senior government officials from at least seven foreign countries since he became Trump's pro-bono personal lawyer in April 2018, according to a CNN review. He has also given paid speeches on behalf of an Iranian dissident group and met with a politician from the Dominican Republic.\n\nWhile Giuliani has long dealt with foreign governments through the self-titled consulting firm he founded in 2002 after serving as New York's mayor, his more recent status as an attorney for the President has enabled him to interact with foreign leaders outside of official diplomatic channels while being treated like a US emissary.\n\nTwo current and two former State Department staffers told CNN that Giuliani's communication with foreign leaders has complicated, and at times undercut, official US foreign policy.\n\nA current State Department staffer who spoke to CNN said US officials track some of Giuliani's comments because they carry the risk of confusing foreign entities and complicating messaging.\n\n\"When someone with that level of profile speaks on highly sensitive issues in a way that doesn't align with US policy, that is noted with concern,\" said the staffer, who spoke on the condition of anonymity due to the sensitivity of the issue.\n\nAndrew Miller, a former official who worked in the State Department during the Bush and Obama administrations and served on the National Security Council during the Obama era said, \"There are those in the State Department and the professional U.S. national security apparatus who view Giuliani as a shadow secretary of state.\"\n\nIn most of Giuliani's foreign interactions, he has pursued private business interests, but his association with Trump is often highlighted by state-run media and groups he meets with.\n\nDuring a business trip to Bahrain in December 2018 in which Giuliani had a rare meeting with the country's leader, King Hamad bin Isa Al Khalifa, the state-run Bahrain News Agency described Giuliani as a \"high-level US delegation.\"\n\nGiuliani also met with Bahrain's crown prince and government ministers and discussed \"the long-standing partnership between Bahrain and the U.S.,\" according to a statement on the prince's official website, which also referred to Giuliani as the leader of a US delegation.\n\nGiuliani said at the time he traveled to Bahrain for talks related to his company Giuliani Security & Safety and the kingdom's security operation. Several months after his trip Giuliani confirmed that GSS had secured a contract to help train the kingdom's police force, which has received international criticism for its repression of protestors, especially in the wake of the 2011 Arab Spring. Giuliani has a previous tie to Bahrain. His former law firm Bracewell Giuliani worked on financial deals for the nation.\n\nGiuliani's 2018 trip was arranged by the lobbying firm Sonoran Policy Group, which was paid by the Bahraini government to \"facilitate meetings and interactions with U.S. administration officials,\" according to foreign lobbying. As a private attorney, Giuliani is not an official member of the President's administration.\n\nSonoran also hosted an event at The Hay-Adams hotel in Washington, DC, where Giuliani met with officials from the Democratic Republic of Congo and discussed a possible consulting arrangement in July 2018, according to a source familiar with the meeting. The New York Times first reported details of Giuliani's attendance at the event.\n\nThat event, the \"Opportunity Africa Summit,\" sought to highlight \"the strategic relationship between the U.S. and Africa,\" according to foreign lobbying disclosures.\n\nCNN previously reported that criminal prosecutors and FBI counterintelligence agents have been looking into Giuliani's business dealings in Ukraine.\n\nGiuliani's efforts in that country have become a recurring theme in testimony given to House impeachment investigators examining allegations that Trump sought Ukrainian help to boost his reelection chances. Bill Taylor, the top US diplomat in Ukraine, said in closed-door testimony last month that Giuliani pressed Ukraine to \"intervene in US domestic policy or politics\" by opening investigations into Trump's political rivals. Giuliani has said he was solely acting \"as a defense attorney to defend my client against false charges, that kept changing as one after another were disproven.\"\n\nGiuliani's interactions with world leaders \u2013 like his visit to Uruguay last November \u2013 can be challenging for the State Department, because he does not work for the US government and does not have an obligation to report the contents of his conversations through official channels, according to Miller.\n\n\"It is dangerous because it creates the possibility that foreign countries can play various actors within the US off against each other,\" he said.\n\n\"When you have someone whose interests are not aligned with the US government who is prioritizing his private financial interests, that\u2026 makes it a possibility that there's going to be some compromising of US national security,\" Miller added.\n\nGiuliani rejected the notion that he has enriched himself abroad through his associations with the President and said everything he has done is legal.\n\n\"I am in private law practice. I practice law honorably and well, never had a complaint. Never had an issue ever in 50 years of private law practice,\" Giuliani told CNN.\n\nGiuliani has at times strayed from US policy in his statements during foreign dealings.\n\nIn June 2018, the US and 11 other nations issued a statement urging the government of Romania to continue its crackdown on corruption.\n\nLess than two months later, Giuliani wrote a letter to Romania's President and criticized the country's National Anticorruption Directorate, which he said had \"severely undermined\" rule of law in the country. He called for \"amnesty\u2026 to those who have been prosecuted and convicted\" by the unit.\n\nAfter Giuliani wrote his letter to Romania, he told The Guardian he was acting as a contractor for the private firm of former FBI director Louis Freeh, who had been retained to review the case of a Romanian businessman convicted in a land-fraud scheme.\n\nFormer Vice President Joe Biden's son, Hunter, was previously retained by the same Romanian businessman but then referred the case to Freeh's firm, according to a source with knowledge. NBC first reported Hunter Biden's role in the case.\n\nWhen Giuliani visited Armenia, where the nation's acting defense minister gave him a private briefing in October 2018, a reporter asked, \"Mr. Giuliani as an adviser\u2026 should [the] Trump administration recognize the Armenian genocide?\"\n\nThe US government does not formally recognize the mass killings of Armenians in the Ottoman Empire as genocide, but Giuliani responded, \"I certainly recognize it and think it's a historical fact, but I'm not here in my capacity as a private lawyer for President Trump. I'm here as a private citizen.\"\n\nDespite Giuliani's insistence on not representing the US government, the conference where he gave a speech referred to him in a schedule as \"Advisor to the President of the United States on Cybersecurity,\" which was Giuliani's role before becoming a personal lawyer for Trump earlier that year.\n\nGiuliani has also contrasted the US government's position on Iran in his work for the Mojahedin-e Khalq (MEK), an Iranian dissident group that the State Department designated a foreign terrorist organization until 2012.\n\nHe gave a speech for the group in Warsaw, Poland, in February, the same day a Middle East ministerial led by the US began in the same city. In his comments, Giuliani called for regime change in Iran.\n\n\"In order to have peace and security in the Middle East, there has to be a major change in the theocratic dictatorship in Iran. It must end,\" Giuliani said, even though the Trump administration has called for a change in Iran's behavior, not regime change.\n\nAs Giuliani answered questions from reporters the day of the speech with his since-indicted associate Lev Parnas at his side, he clarified that the MEK paid him to give the speech in his private capacity.\n\nStill, the group's political wing, the National Council of Resistance of Iran, has repeatedly pointed to Giuliani's White House connection, calling him the \"US President's attorney\" and \"President Trump's personal attorney.\"\n\nSecretary of State Mike Pompeo downplayed Giuliani's actions when asked about them on Gray Television's \"Full Court Press with Greta Van Susteren.\"\n\nHe said it wasn't \"uncommon for private citizens to help\" the US achieve its policy goals, but that he runs the State Department. \"The ultimate responsibility falls to the United States government, for the secretary of state, to deliver on behalf of the outcomes President Trump has committed to the American people he'd achieve.\"\n\nGiuliani's work on behalf of foreign groups has led some Democratic senators to call on the Justice Department to review whether Giuliani has complied with the Foreign Agents Registration Act, or FARA, which requires that representatives of foreign governments and political organizations file public documents that disclose their arrangements.\n\nSen. Tom Udall, a New Mexico Democrat who coauthored with six other Democratic senators a letter calling for a Justice Department review, told CNN in an interview he believes Giuliani could have violated FARA.\n\n\"He's advising the President. He is being paid by foreign entities, and that is exactly what's required to be disclosed under the Foreign Agent Registration Act,\" Udall said. \"I think clearly there may be a violation of the law.\"\n\nFiona Hill, Trump's former top Russia adviser, testified in a deposition before three House committees in October that she was \"extremely concerned that whatever it was that Mr. Giuliani was doing might not be legal,\" in regards to his work in Ukraine.\n\nHill also described learning of Giuliani's planned trip to Ukraine in May. \"And there was, you know, kind of, quite a bit of consternation of the party of the State Department,\" she said.\n\nGiuliani insists he is only guilty of one thing: defending the President.\n\nWhen questioned by CNN's Drew Griffin about his international dealings, Giuliani responded, \"I am being targeted by CNN because I am proving that you are corrupt in your coverage of the President all throughout this impeachment proceeding.\""

        "text": "Less than a month ago, Rep. Elijah Cummings' friend, staffer and wife each took the stage during his funeral at New Psalmist Baptist Church to eulogize the venerated congressman they loved and respected.\n\nFormer NAACP President Kweisi Mfume said his friend \"defied the limits of others' expectations.\" Harry Spikes said his boss taught him a \"true leader shares leadership.\" And, Maya Rockeymoore Cummings said her husband was both a public servant and \"man of the people.\"\n\nNow, all three are running against each other for his open seat.\n\nRockeymoore Cummings, 48, a public policy consultant who resigned Monday night as chairwoman of Maryland's Democratic Party, kicked off her campaign Tuesday, telling supporters crammed into her Madison Park rowhouse that she wanted to spark an \"inclusion revolution\" in the country.\n\n[ Related: Rockeymoore Cummings, widow of Baltimore Rep. Elijah Cummings, will seek his seat ]\n\n\"This race is going to be a sprint to the finish,\" she said to applause. \"This is going to get down and dirty, probably, but I want you to know I'm ready for it.\"\n\nRockeymoore Cummings entered the race among the front-runners in an increasingly crowded field.\n\nAt his campaign announcement last week, Mfume said he talked with Rockeymoore Cummings before deciding to try to regain the seat he held before Cummings.\n\n\"I'm really not trying to cram her or jam her in any way,\" he said. \"She needs time to deal with her soul and her loss. ... I know this has been tough for all of us.\"\n\nBut Rockeymoore Cummings said Tuesday the candidates had not discussed the campaign.\n\n\"Less than 36 hours after my husband passed, he and [political strategist] Larry Gibson asked for a meeting through my pastor,\" Rockeymoore Cummings said. \"We scheduled a meeting. It didn't happen. I did text him and I didn't get a response.\"\n\nThe Mfume campaign declined to comment on Rockeymoore Cummings' statement. But Gibson said Mfume waited 10 days before scheduling the meeting to discuss whether she planned to run.\n\n\"I'm hurt to be falsely accused of such insensitive conduct,\" Gibson said.\n\nA spokesman for Rockeymoore Cummings said she misspoke, and meant to say the call came less than 36 hours after her husband's funeral.\n\nAs for Spikes, Rockeymoore Cummings said: \"I told him I was running. But he did not tell me he was running.\"\n\nSpikes did not respond Tuesday to a request for comment.\n\nOther Democrats in the 7th District field include state Del. Talmadge Branch, who has announced a run. State Sen. Jill P. Carter is set to make a \"special announcement\" next week. Former Baltimore Mayor Stephanie Rawlings-Blake has said she is considering running.\n\nTen Democrats and three Republicans have filed to run in the special primary. Five candidates have filed to run in the regular GOP primary, along with nine Democrats.\n\nRockeymoore Cummings said she isn't bothered that so many people are running for the seat her husband held.\n\n\"This is democracy,\" she said. \"This is up to the people of the 7th District.\"\n\nCummings, who had cancer, died Oct. 17 after serving more than two decades in Congress. He left a record of fighting for the needy and battling the administration of Republican President Donald Trump.\n\nRockeymoore Cummings, the founder of the Washington consulting firm Global Policy Solutions LLC and a 2018 candidate for governor, said her husband told her months before he died he would like for her to succeed him.\n\nRockeymoore Cummings said she resigned Monday as chair of the state Democratic Party to avoid any appearance of favoritism.\n\nState Sen. Cory V. McCray, the party's vice chairman, rose to become interim chairman. He praised Rockeymoore Cummings' tenure at the state party, which he said \"culminated in several Democratic wins last week in competitive municipal races across Wicomico, Kent, and Harford counties.\"\n\n\"I am confident that the party will demonstrate stability and continuity of service in the weeks ahead, as we build for the 2020 elections by fundraising and organizing around the state, and lift up the General Assembly's legislative priorities as we prepare to enter the 2020 legislative session,\" said McCray, of East Baltimore, in a statement.\n\nRockeymoore Cummings was elected as party chair after Republican Gov. Larry Hogan's landslide victory in 2018, and pledged to fight harder and smarter to take back the state.\n\nAnswering questions Tuesday from reporters, Rockeymoore Cummings said she stood by comments she made in March accusing Hogan of being a \"dog-whistle white nationalist\" after he said he modeled himself after Republican President Ronald Reagan.\n\nShe referenced revelations in July that Reagan called African people \"monkeys\" in 1971 during a phone call with Republican President Richard Nixon. \"To see those monkeys from those African countries, damn them. They are still uncomfortable wearing shoes,\" Reagan said on the recording.\n\n\"People weren't familiar with Ronald Reagan's history,\" Rockeymoore Cummings said of backlash to her comments. \"The fact he didn't stand for the Civil Rights Act, the fact that he did have prejudice towards people of color, African-Americans in particular. I think Gov. Hogan needs to rescind those remarks.\"\n\nA spokeswoman for Hogan said Rockeymoore Cummings, not the governor, should take back her comments.\n\n\"Governor Hogan simply said he believes in the Reaganesque vision of a bigger tent and more inclusive politics,\" said Shareese Churchill, the governor's spokeswoman, in an email. \"Clearly, Dr. Cummings does not, and she continues to discredit herself by slandering the governor with the kind of hateful, divisive rhetoric that he has repeatedly spoken out against. She owes Governor Hogan and his family an apology.\"\n\nCandidates must file by Nov. 20 to run in a special Feb. 4 primary in the district, which includes parts of the city of Baltimore and areas of Baltimore and Howard counties. The special election will be held April 28, the same day as a regular primary for all of Maryland's U.S. House seats. Candidates who want to fill Cummings' seat through the rest of his term, until January 2021, and win the seat for the next two years after that, must run in both the special and regular elections.\n\nIf elected, Rockeymoore Cummings said she will push to remove Trump from office.\n\n\"I would vote for impeachment,\" she said. \"What's coming out of Washington is incredibly concerning and disturbing and it basically goes to the heart of the future of our democracy. Congressman Cummings was laser-focused on uncovering the corruption that's happening in the highest office of the land. I will continue to support that agenda.\""

        "text": "Mayor Sylvester Turner is rallying the support of state and national Democrats as he seeks to fend off Tony Buzbee in the December runoff to win a second term at the helm of Houston government.\n\nOne week into the runoff, Turner has gathered the endorsements of Harris County's four Democratic Congress members \u2014 Lizzie Fletcher, Sylvia Garcia, Al Green and Sheila Jackson Lee \u2014 the Texas Democratic Party, 15 Democratic state legislators and the three Democrats on Harris County Commissioners Court.\n\nAlso backing Turner is the Harris County AFL-CIO, which declined to endorse any mayoral candidate in the first leg of the race.\n\nHouston elections officially are nonpartisan, and no affiliation is listed next to candidates on the ballot.\n\nTurner secured 47 percent of the vote in the first round Nov. 5, leading the field of 12 candidates, but he fell short of the 50 percent-plus-one vote he needed to win outright. Buzbee finished second with 28 percent.\n\nBuzbee cast Turner's endorsements as \"the usual special interest suspects,\" contending the mayor has garnered support from labor groups because they \"fear being retaliated against for daring to oppose his campaign. Just look at what happened to the firefighters when they were brave enough to stand up to Turner.\"\n\nIn a statement responding to the endorsements, Buzbee also cited his legal work representing unions and workers.\n\n\"I'm here for positive change and positive change only,\" Buzbee said. \"Just because someone has been manipulating the system for 30 years to further their own interests does not mean that we should keep re-electing them. I believe the voters will agree that just because someone has experience that does not automatically qualify them as the best person for the job.\"\n\nAt a news conference Monday, some of Turner's elected allies sought to tie Buzbee to President Donald Trump, for whom Buzbee once hosted a fundraiser at his River Oaks home. In response to attacks from Turner over his Trump ties, Buzbee has noted his past support for members of both parties, including Turner, and accused the mayor of trying to distract from his record by making the election a referendum on Trump.\n\nGreen, a Houston Democrat and perhaps the most vocal congressional proponent of impeaching Trump, on Monday urged Houstonians not to follow what he said is a growing trend of electing millionaires who lack political experience.\n\n\"We cannot allow this paradigm to persist,\" said Green, D-Houston.\n\nGarcia, meanwhile, accused Buzbee to trying to divide the city.\n\n\"Some of us here on stage, my colleagues and I, see in Washington firsthand what happens when we elect some rich guy with a big ego and no experience,\" said Garcia, D-Houston. \"It just doesn't work. It doesn't work in Washington and it's not going to work in the city of Houston.\"\n\nIn response to the Democratic lawmakers coalescing behind Turner, Buzbee accused the mayor of trying to turn the election into a partisan race.\n\n\"Fixing streets, reducing flooding, addressing homelessness, and paying firefighters fairly are not partisan issues,\" Buzbee said. \"He can focus on partisan labels, I'm focused on the issues that impact the residents of this great city.\"\n\nThe endorsements could represent a minor boost to Turner but have little practical effect because voters already perceived him as a Democrat, said Rice University political scientist Mark Jones. It was only a matter of when, not if, Turner's Democratic allies would get behind him, he added.\n\n\"To the extent that there was a tiny crack open for Tony Buzbee to claim he's a Democrat, this probably shuts the door on that,\" Jones said, noting that Buzbee has framed himself as an independent and sought to appeal to voters from both parties in the nonpartisan mayoral race.\n\nEven before the endorsements, Jones said, Buzbee likely would have had trouble catching on with Democratic voters because he has yet to effectively counter the Trump attacks.\n\n\"Some of his actions, in terms of extravagant behavior and his outsider approach, just reinforce the idea that he's the Houston version of Donald Trump, even though on a policy level that's not the case,\" Jones said. \"But most voters aren't looking that deep.\"\n\nEarly voting in the runoff starts Nov. 27.

        "text": "The White House on Friday released a document summarizing President Donald Trump's first phone call with newly elected Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy in April of this year, seeking to bolster its claim that Trump did nothing wrong in his dealings with the Eastern European leader.\n\nThe tone of the call, which was blasted out moments before ousted Ukrainian ambassador Marie Yovanovitch began testifying in the second impeachment hearing, was much more congratulatory and took place hours after Zelenskiy's historic landslide election.\n\nIt was also significantly shorter than the July 25 call at the center of the House impeachment inquiry.\n\nThe second call between the two leaders, during which Trump asked Zelenskiy to do him a \"favor\" and investigate his political opponents, lasted close to half an hour, while the first call lasted just half that time. According to the White House memorandum of the call, the conversation took place in the late afternoon aboard Air Force One.\n\nTrump begins the call by congratulating Zelenskiy on a \"fantastic election,\" agreeing that Zelenskiy's unlikely victory was similar to his own in 2016 after Zelenskiy tells the president he used Trump as \"a great example\" for his campaign.\n\n\"I have no doubt you will be a fantastic president,\" Trump said, according to the rough transcript, prompting Zelenskiy to invite Trump to his inauguration and telling him he needs to experience Ukraine himself.\n\nTrump then responds by recalling his time running the Miss Universe pageant, remarking that Ukraine \"always had great people\" at the event.\n\nShortly after the White House document was released, Devin Nunes, the top Republican on the House Intelligence committee, read it live during his opening statement of the impeachment inquiry. Chairman Adam Schiff quickly rebutted that while he was glad Trump released the memo, he also would like the administration to release the slew of documents the panel had subpoenaed for the investigation.\n\nThe readout of the April call makes no mention of investigations Trump eventually sought into the Biden family and events surrounding the 2016 election, a focal point of the impeachment inquiry. Although at that point, former Vice President Joe Biden had not yet officially announced his candidacy for president.\n\nSeveral administration officials have testified in closed-door depositions with House impeachment investigators that they eventually came to see mentions of investigating \"corruption\" in Ukraine as code for the Biden and 2016 election investigations.\n\nThough the revelation of what occurred during the July 25 call was the catalyst for House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's decision to initiate impeachment proceedings, the conversation has only been one facet of the investigation. The probe has also uncovered a shadow diplomacy effort and pressure campaign directed toward Ukraine.\n\nAt the beginning of the April call, Zelenskiy emphasized that \"we in Ukraine are an independent country,\" a theme that underscores much of the discomfort with the shadow campaign.\n\nTrump has hailed the July 25 call as \"perfect,\" claiming that it alone exonerates him and demanding on Twitter on a near-daily basis that his critics \"READ THE TRANSCRIPT!\" But in a tweet teasing the release of the first call, Trump asserted the April conversation, being the first between the two leaders, was the \"most important.\"\n\n\"I am sure you will find it tantalizing!\" he added.\n\nShortly after the July 25 call, White House officials, having been alerted to concerns about Trump's request for political investigations, reportedly took the highly unusual step of placing its summary of the conversation in a server meant for classified information. There is no indication it took the same step with the April call.\n\nBut according to testimony from one White House official who listened to both calls, the first was well-received.\n\nLt. Col. Alexander Vindman, who serves as the National Security Council's director for Ukraine, testified to House investigators that the tone of the April 21 call was \"significantly different\" than that of the July call, according to a transcript of the deposition released last week. Whereas Vindman described the April call as \"very positive\" and \"very good,\" prompting high fives among those that listened, he characterized Trump's tone in the July call as \"dour.\""

It's just not a good practice.\"\n\n\"Having said that, there's no insistence on that call, there are no demands on that call, it is a conversation between two presidents that's casual in nature,\" Haley said in an interview on \"Today\" with NBC News' Savannah Guthrie.\n\nAccording to the White House record of Trump's July 25 call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy, Trump asked Zelenskiy for a \"favor,\" suggesting the country probe a debunked conspiracy theory about Democrats and the 2016 election and the Biden family. The call is at the center of the House's impeachment inquiry.\n\nHaley contended that it was appropriate for Trump to ask Ukraine to probe \"corruption.\"\n\n\"OK, but the corruption mentioned by the president here has to do with Joe Biden and the DNC server,\" Guthrie said. \"Those are the two very specific examples.\"\n\n\"An American should want to know the answer of, 'Did Biden pressure the prosecutor to, you know, to do what he did?' And I think there's a real question there. You can question the president, but you also have to question what Biden did,\" Haley said.\n\nTrump and his allies have pushed a theory that Biden acted improperly as vice president when he called on Ukraine to fire its top prosecutor, Viktor Shokin, threatening to hold about $1 billion in aid over the country. Shokin had been investigating Burisma Holdings, a natural gas company that Biden's son Hunter sat on the board of. But press accounts say that probe was long dormant by the time Biden pushed for Shokin's ouster, and his removal as prosecutor was the aim of a number of countries and international bodies. Shokin was accused of ignoring corruption in Ukraine, not pursuing it.\n\nAs Rep. Jim Himes, D-Conn., put it in an interview with NBC's \"Meet the Press\" on Sunday, what Biden had asked for was for the benefit of U.S. foreign policy with the backing of the international community. Democrats have alleged Trump was seeking investigations that would prove politically beneficial to him by directing a pressure campaign that included freezing millions of dollars in Congress-approved military aid that Ukraine depended on to counter Russian aggression.\n\nIn the interview, Guthrie also pressed Haley on Trump's fitness for office and her claims that top officials sought to undermine the president.\n\nHaley addressed a portion of her new book, \"With All Due Respect,\" where she detailed a meeting she had with Trump after that July 2018 press conference, in which the president appeared to side with Putin over U.S. intelligence agencies' determination that Russia interfered in the 2016 election.\n\nIn the meeting Haley recalled, she told Trump he did not do well alongside Putin, a point that surprised Trump because, in Haley's retelling, she was the only person to tell him that.\n\nGuthrie pressed Haley on that claim.\n\n\"Really? You were the only person?\" Guthrie asked. \"I mean that news conference was globally condemned because of that moment, but you were the only person in the administration who said, Hey, that didn't look so great?\"\n\n\"That's what he told me,\" Haley responded. \"I mean when I said I wanted to meet with him, and I go through that in the book, when I said I wanted to meet with him, and I said, 'Look, this sounded soft.' And he said, 'Really?' John Kelly was in the room with me when I had this meeting, and he looked at John and he said, 'All of you guys said I did great.'\"\n\nGuthrie pointed to separate claims from Haley's book, in which she said Kelly, then the White House chief of staff, and then-Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, had sought to undermine Trump's decisions in order to save the country, and asked how she could explain Kelly's offering Trump such a positive assessment of his meeting with Putin in light of those assertions.\n\n\"You ask him those questions,\" Haley said, expressing support for Trump's policies toward Russia. \"But the issue was that on that topic, no one had said anything to him, and I thought it was hugely important, and you'll see later, he comes out, and he comes out much stronger on Russia.\"\n\nHaley also told Guthrie that she did tell Trump of what she described as Kelly and Tillerson's insubordination \u2014 an effort to undermine the president that Haley claims they recruited her to be a part of.\n\nAsked if and when such a conversation between Haley and Trump took place, as well as what the president thought of Haley's assertions, White House press secretary Stephanie Grisham told NBC News, \"I believe that's something you'd need to ask Nikki.\"\n\nSpeaking with NBC's Craig Melvin later Tuesday on \"Today,\" Haley said she would not \"get into the president's response\" to her allegations.\n\n\"So when this first happened, the first person I went to was the National Security Adviser, H.R. McMaster,\" Haley added. \"And he knew too. I mean he was struggling to get things done, and they were stalling with him as well, and his job was to implement the president's policy. And so, he was as frustrated as I was, but he was the first one I went to. And then, obviously, you know, telling the president, you want to protect what his role is.\"\n\n\"And this was just on policy discussions,\" she said. \"This was on the Iran deal. This was on Paris Climate. This wasn't on him being, you know, out there being not able to control himself.\"\n\nMelvin asked if she was surprised Trump kept both men on after she told him of her claims, to which she said, \"Well, they're gone.\"\n\n\"So, I told him in due time, and he figured it out on his own, and the rest he was able to figure out,\" she said of Trump.\n\nIn response to Haley's claims, Kelly told The Washington Post Sunday that if giving Trump \"the best and most open, legal and ethical staffing advice from across the [government] so he could make an informed decision is 'working against Trump,' then guilty as charged.\"\n\nTillerson, meanwhile, told NBC News that \"at no time did I, nor to my direct knowledge did anyone else serving along with me, take any actions to undermine the president.\"\n\n\"Ambassador Haley was rarely a participant in my many meetings, and is not in a position to know what I may not have said to the president,\" he added.\n\nCommenting on Tillerson's statement, Haley said, \"that's Rex.\"\n\n\"I was in every Cabinet meeting, I was in every National Security Council meeting, I was in multiple Oval Office meetings, and what's fascinating, Craig, is Rex and Kelly have never denied that the meeting happened,\" Haley said. \"They've never denied that they did sit me down, that they did say those words, and they know it.\"\n\nGuthrie concluded her interview by asking Haley whether Trump is honest and fit for office. Haley said she never doubted Trump's mental acuity.\n\n\"In every instance that I dealt with him, he was truthful, he listened, and he was great to work with,\" she said.\n\nIn the later interview with Melvin, Haley was asked if Trump should release his tax returns, which he has shielded from the public, breaking with four decades of tradition.\n\n\"I always err on the side of transparency, but the American people didn't care what his tax returns said,\" she said.\n\nAsked if she suggested to Trump that he release them, Haley said, \"No, because he got elected.\"\n\n\"He got elected without releasing them,\" she said.\n"

        "title": "Testimony and texts: How the Trump-Ukraine allegations fit together in a timeline",
        "text": "With so many current U.S. officials testifying in open hearings, and with hundreds of real-time text messages and nearly a dozen transcripts of closed-door testimony now public, the story of President Donald Trump and Ukraine is sometimes hard to follow.\n\nHow do each of the testimonies and text messages fit together? What allegations do they contain about Trump's actions and those of his government advisers?\n\nThese are the bottom-line allegations:\n\n- Driven by debunked claims promoted by conservative media and his personal attorney Rudy Giuliani, Trump pushed the newly-elected president of Ukraine, Vlodymyr Zelenskiy, to investigate Trump's political rival, former Vice President Joe Biden. Trump even wanted Zelenskiy to announce the investigation in public, witnesses testified.\n\n- Meanwhile, Zelenskiy was eager to visit the White House and meet with Trump. At the White House's behest, senior U.S. officials made clear to Zelenskiy's team that a White House visit would only happen if Ukraine investigated Biden and announced it publicly.\n\n- While the Ukrainians were pushing for a White House visit and Trump administration officials were pushing for a Biden investigation, Trump directed the U.S. government to freeze much-needed military aid to Ukraine. (For years, Ukraine has been engaged in a bloody war with Russia. The United States was sending military aid to Ukraine to help keep Russia at bay and keep Ukrainian soldiers alive -- and that aid enjoyed bipartisan support in Congress and even \"unanimous\" support within relevant parts of the U.S. government.)\n\n- The Ukrainian officials may not have realized it, but Trump's top diplomat to Ukraine alleged that the White House refused to restart military aid until Ukraine agreed to investigate Biden and announce it publicly. And, while the military aid was frozen, Trump specifically wanted to know the status of Ukraine's investigations.\n\n- Military assistance to Ukraine was finally restarted two days after three House committees announced they were investigating recently-received allegations that Trump sought \"to pressure the government of Ukraine to assist the president's reelection campaign\" by, among other things, withholding the military aid.\n\nHere is a timeline of this year's events, as relayed in testimony -- under oath -- to Congress and in publicly-released documents from the time:\n\nBY JANUARY: Giuliani launched a quiet campaign to corroborate claims of Obama-era corruption in Ukraine, including claims that Ukraine had \"colluded\" with Democrats in the 2016 U.S. presidential election and that, as vice president, Biden abused his position to protect his son. Giuliani believed that Biden pressured Ukraine to fire the nation's top prosecutor because the prosecutor was investigating Burisma, a Ukrainian company paying Biden's son to be on its board. (U.S. officials have since testified that the claims were not credible and that they were being peddled by the prosecutor's successor, Yuriy Lutsenko, who was trying to save his job. In fact, officials testified, Biden pressured Ukraine to fire the prosecutor because he was ineffective and accused of corruption.)\n\nBY MID-APRIL: Lutsenko publicized his claims about Biden in an interview with a Trump-friendly journalist, and larger conservative media outlets began to cover them. Giuliani promoted the claims on Fox News.\n\nAPRIL 21: Zelenskiy was elected president of Ukraine after vowing to root out corruption. Trump called Zelenskiy to congratulate him. The call was \"complimentary\" and \"positive,\" and Trump \"extended an invitation [for Zelenskiy] to visit the White House,\" according to testimony.\n\nMAY 23: After returning from Zelenskiy's inauguration, Trump's special envoy to Ukraine, Kurt Volker, Energy Secretary Rick Perry and Trump's ambassador to the European Union, Gordon Sondland, met with Trump to discuss Ukraine. The group told the president he should meet with Zelenskiy at the White House. Trump complained that Ukraine \"tried to take him down\" in 2016 and told the group, \"talk to Rudy [Giuliani],\" Volker and Sondland each testified. (The three officials ended up working with Giuliani \"at the express direction of the president,\" Sondland testified publicly.)\n\nMAY 29: Trump sent a letter to Zelenskiy, congratulating him on taking charge and saying, \"I would like to invite you to meet with me at the White House in Washington, D.C., as soon as we can find a mutually convenient time.\"\n\nMID-JUNE: \"The Ukrainians were clearly eager for the meeting to happen,\" according to Trump's top U.S. diplomat to Ukraine, Bill Taylor. But in multiple \"communications\" Volker and Sondland both told Taylor \"that the president wanted to hear from Zelenskiy before scheduling the meeting in the Oval Office,\" Taylor testified. U.S. officials then began preparing Trump for a phone call with Zelenskiy, according to Taylor.\n\nJUNE 28: Volker separately told colleagues that, while in Toronto with Zelenskiy on July 2, he was going to tell the Ukrainian president that if he wants a White House meeting, he will have to show Trump that he's willing to \"cooperate\" on investigations, according two people in those separate conversations, Taylor and National Security Council staffer Army Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman.\n\nJULY 3: After meeting with Zelenskiy in Toronto, Volker claimed to others that he told Zelenskiy that Trump would want to hear about \"the investigations,\" Taylor testified. (Without disputing it, Volker did not corroborate that account himself, telling Congress only that while in Toronto he warned Zelenskiy that Giuliani was promoting \"a negative narrative about Ukraine\" and it was \"probably influencing President Trump's thinking.\")\n\nJULY 7: Taylor texted Volker: \"Can you tell [the Ukrainians] that we can schedule the phone call if Ze[lenskiy] is ready to say that he is not interfering, one way or another, in any investigations?\"\n\nJULY 10: In a meeting with senior Ukrainian officials in Washington, including Zelenskiy's top aide Andriy Yermak, Sondland testified that he mentioned \"the pre-requisite of investigations before any White House call or meeting.\" Vindman and Hill recalled Sondland's mention of \"the deliverable required in order to get the meeting,\" as Vindman, who was at the meeting with Ukrainians, described it.\n\nJULY 10, LATER IN AFTERNOON: In another meeting with Ukrainian officials, Sondland again outlined \"the deliverable for these investigations in order to secure this meeting,\" insisting \"that the Ukrainians would have to deliver an investigation into the Bidens,\" Vindman testified. Sondland also said his message \"had been coordinated with White House Chief of Staff Mr. Mick Mulvaney,\" Vindman testified. Hill, again, offered a similar account. (Sondland testified he could not recall such discussions from the follow-up meeting.)\n\nMID-JULY: \"By [this time] it was becoming clear that the meeting President Zelenskiy wanted was conditioned on the investigations of Burisma and alleged Ukrainian interference in the 2016 U.S. elections,\" Taylor testified. \"It was also clear that this condition was driven by the irregular policy channel I had come to understand was guided by Mr. Giuliani.\" At this time, Giuliani \"had been communicating with Ukrainians without our knowledge,\" Sondland testified.\n\nJULY 13: Sondland emailed an NSC official saying the \"sole purpose\" of a phone call between Trump and Zelenskiy \"is for Zelenskiy to give [Trump] assurances of \u2018new sheriff' in town,\" including assurances that \"any hampered investigations will be allowed to move forward transparently. Goal is for Potus to invite him to Oval.\"\n\nJULY 18: On a multi-agency conference call, an official with the Office of Management and Budget announced that military aid to Ukraine had been inexplicably suspended at Trump's direction, Taylor and senior State Department official George Kent testified. In a text message to Volker and Sondland that day, Taylor wrote that the OMB official said \"all security assistance to Ukraine is frozen per a conversation with Mulvaney and POTUS.\"\n\nJULY 19: Volker texted Sondland and Taylor to set up a call with Yermak, Zelenskiy's aide. \"Most impt is for Zelensky to say that he will help investigation,\" Volker texted. At this time, Zelenskiy's team knew Trump wanted the Bidens investigated and that Trump had not yet agreed to a White House visit, Volker testified. (No evidence has surfaced so far suggesting Zelenskiy's team knew at this point that military aid had been frozen.)\n\nJULY 25, MINUTES BEFORE TRUMP-ZELENSKIY CALL: Volker texted Yermak: \"Heard from White House -- assuming President Z convinces trump he will investigate / \u2018get to the bottom of what happened' in 2016. we will nail down date for visit to Washington.\"\n\nJULY 25, THE PHONE CALL: According to a rough transcript released by the White House, Trump insisted on the phone with Zelenskiy that \"the United States has been very, very good to Ukraine. I wouldn't say that it's reciprocal necessarily.\" Then Trump said to Zelenskiy: \"I would like you to do us a favor \u2026 I would like you to find out what happened with this whole situation with Ukraine.\" Later in the call, Trump raised Biden and his son, claiming, \"Biden stopped the prosecution and a lot of people want to find out about that so whatever you can do with the Attorney General would be great.\" After Zelenskiy noted that one of his \"assistants spoke with Mr. Giuliani just recently,\" Trump asked Zelenskiy to work with Giuliani.\n\nJULY 26: After meeting with Yermak in Ukraine, Sondland went with three U.S. embassy staffers to a restaurant, where Sondland called Trump from an outdoor terrace, one of those staffers, David Holmes, testified. During the conversation, much of which Holmes could overhear because Trump was speaking so loudly, Sondland told Trump that Zelenskiy, \"loves your ass;\" Trump then asked, \"So he's gonna do the investigation?\" Holmes recalled. \"Ambassador Sondland replied \"he's gonna do it\" and he would \"do anything you ask him to.\" After the call, Sondland told Holmes that Trump did not \"give a s--- about Ukraine\" and only cared about \"big stuff\" like the Biden investigation, Holmes testified. (Sondland confirmed in his public testimony that he spoke with Trump by phone that day, and while he has \"no recollection of discussing Vice President Biden or his son\" afterward, he also has \"no reason to doubt [the others'] accounts.\" Trump said he \"knows nothing\" about such a call with Sondland.)\n\nEARLY TO MID-AUGUST: Trump wanted Zelenskiy to publicly announce the investigations, several officials testified. And, in several calls with Sondland, Giuliani \"demanded\" that the public statement include investigations of the 2016 election, Sondland testified. \"He kept repeating Burisma and 2016 election,\" Sondland said. Giuliani \"was expressing the desires of the president,\" and \"Giuliani's requests were a quid pro quo for arranging a White House visit for President Zelenskiy,\" according to Sondland's public testimony.\n\nAUG. 9: Discussing the proposed Trump-Zelenskiy meeting, Sondland texted Volker: \"I think potus really wants the deliverable.\"\n\nAUG. 10: Yermak texted Volker: \"I think it's possible to make this declaration,\" but \"it will be logic to do after we receive a confirmation of date\" for the White House visit. Later that same day, Yermak texted again, saying, \"Once we have a date, we will call for a press briefing, announcing upcoming visit and outlining vision for the reboot of US-UKRAINE relationship, including among other things Burisma and election meddling investigations.\"\n\nAUGUST 11: Sondland sent an email to senior State Department officials intended for Secretary of State Mike Pompeo: \"Mike \u2013 Kurt and I negotiated a statement from Ze[lenskiy] to be delivered for our review in a day or two. The contents will hopefully make the boss happy enough to authorize an invitation. Ze plans to have a big presser on the openness subject (including specifics) next week.\"\n\nAUG. 13: After consulting with Sondland and Giuliani, Volker sent Yermak a draft of Zelenskiy's proposed announcement, which said Ukraine would investigate \"Burisma and the 2016 U.S. election.\" Volker told Yermak those references were \"2 key items.\" Ultimately, Volker recommended to Yermak that any statement not include the specific references, Volker testified.\n\nAUG. 16: Kent, the senior State Department official, wrote a memo saying he had \"concerns that there was an effort to initiate politically motivated prosecutions that were injurious to the rule of law, both Ukraine and U.S.,\" as Kent later described it to Congress.\n\nAUG. 28: Politico published an article saying U.S. assistance to Ukraine had been suspended. The Ukrainians were on notice.\n\nSEPT. 1: Vice President Pence and Zelenskiy met in Warsaw. Before the meeting, Sondland told Pence he had \"had concerns that the delay in aid had become tied to the issue of investigations,\" Sondland testified publicly. In a brief one-on-one meeting with Yermak while in Warsaw, Sondland told Yermak \"that resumption of U.S. aid would likely not occur until Ukraine provided the public anti-corruption statement that [they] had been discussing for many weeks,\" Sondland told Congress. On the same day, Sondland recalled to Taylor that -- in a previous conversation -- Trump said \"he wants President Zelenskiy to state publicly that Ukraine will investigate Burisma and alleged Ukrainian interference in the 2016 U.S. election,\" Taylor testified. (Sondland told Congress he didn't recall making such statements to Taylor.)\n\nSEPT. 8: After Trump demanded that Zelinskiy \"clear things up and do it in public,\" Sondland informed Zelinskiy that \"if President Zelenskiy did not clear things up in public, we would be at a stalemate,\" Taylor said he was told, which Taylor took to mean \"Ukraine would not receive the much-needed military assistance.\" Zelenskiy then agreed to make a public statement in an interview with CNN. Kent said he recalled Sondland suggesting that announcing investigations on CNN would clear the way for a White House visit.\n\nSEPT. 9: Taylor sent a text to Volker and Sondland, saying, \"Withholding security assistance in exchange for help with a domestic political campaign in the United States would be crazy.\"\n\nSEPT. 9: After receiving information from the U.S. intelligence community's inspector general, three House committees announced they were launching a \"wide-ranging investigation\" into whether Trump and Giuliani sought \"to pressure the government of Ukraine to assist the President's reelection campaign\" by, among other things, withholding military aid to Ukraine.\n\nSEPT. 11: The hold on military aid to Ukraine was lifted, according to Taylor.\n\nSEPT. 25: The rough transcript of Trump's July 25 call with Zelenskiy was released. On the same day, Trump and Zelenskiy met in New York, alongside the U.N. General Assembly. Sitting next to Trump and in front of cameras, Zelenskiy told reporters he felt \"no pressure\" from Trump, adding, \"Nobody pushed me.\" Zelenskiy called their July 25 call \"good\" and \"normal.\""

        "text": "House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi said on Thursday President Donald Trump already has admitted to bribery in the Ukraine scandal at the heart of a Democratic-led inquiry, accusing him of an impeachable offense under the U.S. Constitution.\n\n\"The bribe is to grant or withhold military assistance in return for a public statement of a fake investigation into the elections. That's bribery,\" Pelosi, the top Democrat in Congress, told a news conference the day after the first public hearing in the impeachment inquiry she announced in September.\n\n\"What the president has admitted to and says it's \u2018perfect,' I say it's perfectly wrong. It's bribery,\" Pelosi said.\n\nDemocrats are looking into whether the Republican president abused his power by withholding $391 million in U.S. security aid to Ukraine as leverage to pressure Kiev to conduct two investigations that would benefit him politically. The money, approved by Congress to help a U.S. ally combat Russia-backed separatists in the eastern part of the country, was later provided to Ukraine.\n\nTrump has denied any wrongdoing.\n\nAnother central figure - former U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch - is due to testify on Friday in the second public hearing in the inquiry.\n\nWhite House budget official Mark Sandy will testify in the inquiry in a closed session on Saturday as scheduled if he is subpoenaed, his lawyer said on Thursday.\n\nThe inquiry threatens Trump's presidency even as he seeks re-election in November 2020. If the House approves articles of impeachment - formal charges - against Trump, the Senate would then hold a trial on whether to convict him and remove him from office. Republicans control the Senate and have shown little support for Trump's removal.\n\nPelosi's comments could offer a preview of articles of impeachment Democrats might put forward. At her news conference, she also said Trump's administration had committed \"obstruction of Congress\" by blocking testimony of officials summoned to testify in the inquiry.\n\nThe Constitution states that impeachable offenses include \"treason, bribery or other high crimes and misdemeanors.\" Democrats have begun to use the words bribery or attempted bribery in discussing Trump's actions. According to precedent, obstruction could be another article of impeachment.\n\nRepublicans have said House Democrats already have decided to pass articles of impeachment, but Pelosi denied that was the case, saying the inquiry must play out before any decision can be made.\n\nThe focus of the inquiry is a July 25 phone call in which Trump asked Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy to investigate Democratic rival Joe Biden and the former vice president's son Hunter, who had served as a board member for a Ukrainian energy company called Burisma. Trump also asked Zelenskiy to investigate a debunked conspiracy theory embraced by some Trump allies that Ukraine, not Russia, interfered in the 2016 U.S. election.\n\nPelosi compared Trump's actions with former President Richard Nixon's conduct in the Watergate corruption scandal that led him in 1974 to become the only U.S. president to resign. Pelosi said Trump's actions to enlist a foreign power to help him in a U.S. election and the obstruction of information about that - she called it a cover-up - \"makes what Nixon did look almost small.\"\n\nRepublicans kept up their attacks on Adam Schiff, the Democratic chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, which is holding the public hearings. House Republican leader Kevin McCarthy accused Schiff of lying at Wednesday's hearing about not knowing the identity of the whistleblower within the U.S. intelligence community whose complaint about Trump's call triggered the impeachment inquiry.\n\nAn estimated 13.8 million viewers across 10 broadcast and cable television networks watched the first day of proceedings, according to Nielsen ratings data.\n\nTwo career U.S. diplomats, William Taylor and George Kent, testified on Wednesday. Taylor, the acting ambassador to Ukraine, offered an account that linked Trump more directly to the pressure campaign on Ukraine.\n\nThe Intelligence Committee is due to hear on Friday from Yovanovitch, whom Trump abruptly removed from her post as ambassador to Ukraine in May. Trump's personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, was working at the time to persuade Ukraine to carry out the two investigations.\n\nYovanovitch told lawmakers behind closed doors on Oct. 11 that Trump ousted her based on \"unfounded and false claims by people with clearly questionable motives\" after she came under attack by Giuliani.\n\nOn Wednesday, Taylor offered a new disclosure that indicated Trump's keen interest in the investigations in Ukraine, saying a member of his staff overheard a July 26 phone call at a restaurant in which Trump asked about the probes the president had asked Zelenskiy to conduct a day earlier.\n\nAfter the call between Trump and Gordon Sondland, a former political donor appointed as the U.S. envoy to the European Union, the staff member asked Sondland what Trump thought about Ukraine, Taylor said.\n\n\"Ambassador Sondland responded that President Trump cares more about the investigations of Biden, which Giuliani was pressing for,\" Taylor testified.\n\nRepublican lawmakers called Taylor's account hearsay.\n\nA second staffer for the U.S. Embassy in Kiev overheard the phone call between Trump and Sondland, the Associated Press reported on Thursday, citing an unnamed source briefed on the situation.\n\nTrump told reporters after the hearing that he knew \"nothing\" about the call with Sondland.\n\nThe staffer cited by Taylor is David Holmes, a Taylor aide who has been subpoenaed to testify in the inquiry on Friday behind closed doors, said a person familiar with the issue.\n\nDemocrats are aiming to settle the question of Trump's impeachment before the end of the year."

        "title": "Biden, Warren absence at California gathering irks top Dems",
        "text": "The decisions by Joe Biden and Elizabeth Warren to skip a weekend gathering of thousands of fervent California Democrats less than three months before voting begins have frustrated and puzzled some party leaders.\n\nBut they have offered a chance for their rivals to capitalize on the absence of two front-runners at the gathering that serves as an unofficial kickoff of the final sprint to California's March 3 primary, which offers the biggest delegate haul of any primary or caucus.\n\nVermont Sen. Bernie Sanders in particular could benefit from Warren's absence as the two battle over the party's most progressive voters, many of whom were galvanized to become more involved in official party politics after Sanders' 2016 bid. Sanders' campaign has already hired 40 staff members in California, far more than any of his competitors, and is treating the state as comparable to early voting states like Iowa and New Hampshire.\n\n\"The senator makes it clear that the state is his priority,\" said Jane Kim, the campaign's California political director and former member of the San Francisco Board of Supervisors.\n\nThe convention stage will give candidates a chance to address devoted Democrats who are the backbone of the party, who are coveted for their votes as well as potential volunteers and donors. Mail-in ballots for California's primary will begin going out to voters on Feb. 3, the same day as the Iowa caucuses.\n\nThe main event is a Saturday night presidential candidate forum hosted by Univision, the Spanish-language television station, featuring Sanders, California Sen. Kamala Harris and six others. Several other lower-polling candidates, including former Massachusetts Gov. Deval Patrick, who just entered the race Thursday, will address delegates in the morning.\n\nWarren's and Biden's decisions to skip the party gathering drew a rare rebuke from Rusty Hicks, the chair of the state party.\n\n\"Your decision is a blatant disregard and disrespect to California's grassroots leaders who make the phone calls, knock the doors, and give the money ... in swing districts and swing states alike ... year after year after year,\" he tweeted.\n\nThis will be the third major gathering of Democratic contenders Biden is skipping in California; he avoided the party's summer convention as well as a Democratic National Committee gathering. Warren attended both.\n\nBiden appeared in the state Thursday, attracting a few hundred people to an outdoor rally at the edge of downtown Los Angeles. He spent Friday raising money in Seattle before heading to Las Vegas for a town hall Saturday. Warren planned to spend Saturday in Iowa, the first state to vote.\n\nBiden's campaign is confident that as a fixture in national Democratic politics, he has an advantage as a familiar face to most voters.\n\nHe's visited California several times in recent months, munching tacos with Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti, speaking to union members and raising money. But his staff remains just a handful of people and a recently named state director, though it's expected to expand at some point.\n\nThe campaign is confident he's popular enough to claim at least 15 percent of the vote in each of the state's 53 congressional districts, the critical threshold for capturing one or more delegates. And they say his support from working-class voters, union members, blacks and Hispanics, along with significant chunks of independents and moderates, can't be duplicated by any other candidate.\n\nYet Biden remains among a cluster of rivals with no clear front-runner, state and national polls suggest.\n\nSome California Democrats speculate Biden is avoiding the crowd because it's made up of activists known to boo more centrist candidates, particularly those who don't support Medicare for All.\n\n\"It genuinely sounds like he's afraid of us,\" said RL Miller, chair of the party's environmental caucus.\n\nWarren's absence, meanwhile, provides an opening for Sanders' to reassert his dominance among the party's progressive wing. Warren's strong performance at earlier campaign conventions, and her face-to-face meetings with activists, enticed many supporters.\n\nHer campaign still plans to have a presence at the convention, planning training sessions for volunteers with top campaign staff members.\n\nChristine Pelosi, chair of the party's women's caucus and the daughter of U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, said she thinks Warren will be hurt more than Biden by skipping the gathering because it provides a way for candidates to \"strengthen their populist cred.\"\n\nSanders, meanwhile, planned two campaign rallies ahead of the convention. His campaign has five offices open around the state and is focused on outreach to Latino voters and Californians whose native language is not English. The campaign hopes to have 15 to 20 campaign offices open by the end of the year, and one of Sanders' deputy campaign managers is based in California, highlighting the campaign's focus on the state.\n\nOthers speaking at the Saturday night forum are Harris, Pete Buttigieg, New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker, former Obama cabinet secretary Julian Castro, Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar, billionaire activist Tom Steyer and businessman Andrew Yang."

He has not made a final decision on whether to run, but he is expected to do so quickly, given fast-approaching deadlines to get on the ballot in key states.\n\nPatrick is the second Democrat to weigh jumping into the race at this late juncture, less than three months before the kickoff Iowa caucuses. Former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg is also reconsidering a run, citing concerns about the current Democratic frontrunners' ability to defeat President Donald Trump. Bloomberg is expected to make a final decision on his 2020 prospects within days.\n\nThe New York Times first reported the news.\n\nThe people with knowledge of Patrick's deliberations spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the matter publicly.\n\nThough he ruled out a run earlier this year, Patrick reopened conversations with close friends and aides over the summer, but did not steps to form a campaign. In recent days, those conversations have intensified, with Patrick himself gauging interest in a run with donors and Democratic operatives.\n\nHe would face big hurdles to launching a campaign at this late stage. Unlike Bloomberg, a wealthy billionaire who would self-fund, Patrick would have to quickly raise money to build out a campaign operation and boost his familiarity with voters. Some of his former political advisers are already working for other 2020 candidates.\n\nRecommended\n\nPatrick, who made history as Massachusetts' first black governor, could gain traction in neighboring New Hampshire, which holds the first primary contest. However, he'd face stiff competition from two other neighboring contenders, Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, as well as former Vice President Joe Biden.\n\nNew Hampshire's primary filing deadline is Friday.\n\nPatrick flirted with the idea of launching a 2020 White House bid before deciding late last year against jumping into the race. At the time, he cited what he called the \"cruelty\" of the election process.\n\n\"After a lot of conversation, reflection and prayer, I've decided that a 2020 campaign for president is not for me,\" Patrick posted on his Facebook page last year. Patrick said he and his wife worried that the \"cruelty of our elections process would ultimately splash back on people whom Diane and I love, but who hadn't signed up for the journey.\""

        "title": "Chief Justice John Roberts, who's clashed with Trump, would oversee impeachment trial",
        "text": "If President Donald Trump faces an impeachment trial in the U.S. Senate, it would mark the third time in history a U.S. Supreme Court chief justice would have to preside over the affair -- but the first time for one who has clashed openly with the very president whose fate hangs in the balance.\n\nTrump has called Chief Justice John Roberts an \"absolute disaster\" and a \"nightmare for conservatives.\"\n\nRoberts, who is constitutionally bound to oversee impeachment trial proceedings, has publicly chided Trump for criticizing federal judges.\n\n\"We do not have Obama judges or Trump judges, Bush judges or Clinton judges,\" he said last year in a statement.\n\nThe chief justice has said nothing publicly about the impeachment inquiry or any preparations for a possible trial. A court spokeswoman has declined to comment on the record. But Roberts, now in his 15th term on the bench, is almost certainly watching developments on Capitol Hill with a wary eye.\n\n\"He well understands, at this extraordinarily polarized time, with the eyes of the whole country on him, it's urgently important that he be perceived by both sides as being entirely neutral and fair, and I'm sure that's what he's going to do,\" said Jeffrey Rosen, a constitutional scholar and CEO of the National Constitution Center who has interviewed Roberts.\n\n\"They have their job to do, and you have to recognize that,\" Roberts said of Congress and the White House in a September speech on the same day House Speaker Nancy Pelosi opened Democrats' formal impeachment inquiry into Trump. \"In our branch, our job is to interpret the law and ensure compliance with the Constitution.\"\n\nRoberts, who famously compared his role as a justice to a baseball umpire calling balls and strikes, would be tested like never before. He has no experience as a trial judge, and he's assiduously sought to avoid the very type of political spectacle he'd have to oversee.\n\n\"I don't think you feel any extra pressure because of the president's attack, but Roberts will be reinforced in his determination to uphold the ideal that he cares about,\" Rosen said. \"He feels passionately about the need for the courts to be perceived in a nonpartisan way; he's said it ever since he was appointed as Chief Justice.\"\n\nAll signs suggest Roberts intends to remain religiously focused on the court's docket -- some 896 cases so far this term -- and seek to avoid disruptions to the court's business at all costs.\n\nThe justices are currently weighing decisions on employment discrimination against gay, lesbian and transgender Americans; Trump's elimination of Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA; life sentences for juvenile offenders; gun rights; and abortion.\n\nAn impeachment trial would force Roberts into a delicate balancing act, splitting time between deliberating on cases and deliberating on the fate of the president -- both significant and high-stakes.\n\nThe best scenario for Roberts would be for a Senate trial to occur during one of the court's planned recesses in either late December into early January, or late January into early February. But conflict between scheduled court sittings and impeachment proceedings might be impossible to avoid.\n\nPresident Bill Clinton's Senate impeachment trial ran from Jan. 7 to Feb. 12, 1999, including several days when the Supreme Court was in session.\n\n\"Chief Justice (William) Rehnquist would hear argument on the east side of the street in the morning from 10 to 12, then cross to the other side to preside in the Senate, in some cases well into the night,\" said Neil Richards, a former Rehnquist clerk during the 1999 impeachment trial of Clinton.\n\nIf Roberts is unable to preside at a scheduled court sitting, Justice Clarence Thomas would manage the session as the senior member of the bench. Roberts would still be allowed to vote in cases before the court, but would have to do so based on legal briefs and transcripts of the oral arguments.\n\n\"A judge who's a good manager of his time should be able to work harder at night and catch up on the regular work of the term,\" said Eric Claeys, a former Rehnquist clerk during the 1995-1996 term.\n\nDespite the complicated schedule, involvement of the chief justice in an impeachment trial will add solemnity and an air of impartiality, which the founding fathers intended, political historians said.\n\n\"The chief justice is in the chair. And senators are not allowed to speak. So, that's the way it will be handled in the Senate,\" Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said of the process earlier this month.\n\nIf his Supreme Court sessions are any guide, Roberts' style at trial would be punctual, formal, polite but firm, not afraid to show a sense of humor or to challenge colleagues when he doesn't agree.\n\nHe would be tasked with moderating the impeachment proceedings, setting the pace, authorizing senators to speak or stop speaking, and would decide on motions and admissibility of evidence. During questioning of any witnesses, the chief justice is the conduit for senators to submit their queries in writing, according to Senate rules.\n\n\"Experts in Senate procedure will no doubt offer him advice,\" said Richards, \"but the calls he makes are subject to reversal by the other 50 people in the room. He can make a ruling and 50 other people can overrule him.\"\n\nIn the event a vote is called and there's a tie, the chief would break it.\n\n\"He would try to be even more neutral than Rehnquist, if possible, and Rehnquist was almost completely neutral,\" said Rosen. \"He consulted a Senate parliamentarian before making many of his rulings and Roberts might do the same.\"\n\nDuring the Clinton impeachment, Rehnquist made just one notable substantive ruling. When a senator objected to another's characterization of the lawmakers as \"jurors,\" Rehnquist upheld the objection and said they were sitting as a court.\n\nRehnquist refused to weigh in on excluding evidence or limiting debate, instead deferring to senators for backroom negotiations or a simple majority vote to resolve a question.\n\n\"He presided, but it was the Senate's trial,\" Claeys said. \"His job was mostly a ceremonial one.\"\n\nDuring a trial, Roberts would receive a temporary office off of the Senate floor and be allowed two aides seated beside him in the chamber. Rehnquist always had one of his three clerks present along with his Administrative Assistant James Duff, who is now the director of the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts, Richards said.\n\nRoberts' reputation as an institutionalist suggests he would try to closely follow the example of Rehnquist, for whom he also once clerked. But scholars say the chief justice has the potential to be much more engaged in impeachment trial proceedings should he choose to be.\n\n\"This is literally an ancient and rarely used constitutional mechanism, and when things creak into life they take on a life of their own,\" said Richards. \"Not only are careers and legacies at stake, but they are directing the future of the country. And the normal rules may not apply.\""

        "text": "Donald Bean, 103, a lawyer in Philadelphia for 64 years, died Saturday, Nov. 9, of pneumonia at his home in Society Hill.\n\nIn December 1945 Mr. Bean joined the law firm Wolf, Block, Schorr & Solis-Cohen, in which his father-in-law, George Schorr, was a partner. Mr. Schorr died a year later, but Mr. Bean rose quickly through the ranks, serving on the firm's executive committee and as chairman of its real estate department for 12 years.\n\nIn 1987, after 42 years of practice, he reached the firm's mandatory retirement age, but continued to do legal work until shortly before the firm disbanded in 2009, a victim of key partner defections and tight credit markets.\n\nMr. Bean took continuing legal education courses into his 90s, although he was retired. He was a member of the Pennsylvania Bar for 74 years.\n\nHe was a modest, unpretentious man. When asked at his 100th birthday party the secret of his longevity, he told family: \"I always got plenty of sleep.\"\n\nThe oldest child of Samuel Bean and Fanny Amster Bean, he was born in 1916 in Newark, N.J. His given name was Seymour Donald Bean, but he dropped the first name in his teens. He grew up in Newark and graduated from South Newark High School in 1934, Lafayette College in 1937, and Harvard Law School in 1940.\n\nIn 1941, he went to work for the federal government at what later became the War Production Board when it was established in January 1942 by an executive order of President Franklin D. Roosevelt. The board replaced two other government agencies.\n\nIn the fall of 1941, a friend introduced him to Fahnya Schorr, a Philadelphian and 1940 Smith College graduate. They were married in 1942.\n\nAlthough Mr. Bean's job in war production during World War II was deemed enough to earn him a deferment from active duty, he enlisted in the Naval Officers Training Program, and in April 1943 accepted a commission as an ensign in the Navy. He served throughout the remainder of the war as an officer in charge of Navy gun crews on two U.S. merchant ships. He was honorably discharged in 1945 with the rank of lieutenant.\n\nHe spent his free time on civic and charitable work, much of it for Jewish causes. From 1963 to 1967, as president of Congregation Rodeph Shalom, he oversaw the purchase of additional properties on the 600 block of North Broad Street, where the synagogue is located, enabling the congregation to expand its facilities a half-century later.\n\nHe was president of the Federation of Reform Synagogues and a board member of what is now the Union of Reform Judaism. He served on the union's executive committee and its committee for rabbinical placement.\n\nFor 50 years, Mr. Bean served on the board of Jewish Family and Children's Service of Greater Philadelphia, which honored him with two lifetime achievement awards.\n\nHe served on the Committee of Seventy in Philadelphia, and was active in the United Fund of Greater Philadelphia and Southern New Jersey. For many years, he was the oldest member of the Union League of Philadelphia.\n\nMr. Bean was an early convert to the culture of fitness. In 1957, when his wife gave birth to their third son, he took up jogging to increase his chances of seeing the boy reach adulthood. He continued jogging into his 70s, when he switched to walking, and he continued to walk daily until shortly before he died. At his death, his youngest son was 62.\n\n\"He had no fear of dissenting from received wisdom and no fear of following it when he thought it correct,\" his family said. \"He loved a good argument.\"\n\nHis wife died in 2013. He is survived by sons Henry, George, and Donald Jr.; seven grandchildren; a great-granddaughter; and a sister.\n\nServices were Sunday, Nov. 10, with interment in Mount Sinai Cemetery."

        "title": "Republicans discuss a longer Senate impeachment trial to scramble Democratic primaries",
        "text": "Some Republican senators and their advisers are privately discussing whether to pressure GOP leaders to stage a lengthy impeachment trial beginning in January to scramble the Democratic presidential race \u2014 potentially keeping six contenders in Washington until the eve of the Iowa caucuses or longer.\n\nThose conversations about the timing and framework for a trial remain fluid and closely held, according to more than a dozen participants in the discussions. But the deliberations come as Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) faces pressure from conservative activists to swat back at Democrats as public impeachment hearings began this week in the House.\n\nThe discussions raise a potential hazard for the six Democratic senators running for president, who had previously planned on a final sprint out of Washington before the Feb. 3 Iowa caucuses and the Feb. 11 New Hampshire primary.\n\n\"That might be a strategy,\" Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.) said with a coy smile when asked about the possibility of a trial that disrupts the Democratic campaign. \"But I'll leave that up to others. I'm just a lowly worker.\"\n\nSen. John Cornyn (R-Tex.), a McConnell ally, said the Senate would try to distinguish itself during impeachment \"by doing this right,\" with a trial that probably lasts five or six weeks. But he acknowledged the timing could have an effect on the campaign by giving a potential boost to presidential candidates who have no official role in the process.\n\n\"Pete Buttigieg and Joe Biden might like that,\" Cornyn said of the mayor of South Bend, Ind., and the former vice president, who now poll in the top four in Iowa with Sens. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) and Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.).\n\nThere is an emerging divide among Republicans, however, over timing. While some Republicans favor a lengthy trial as a means of defending President Trump and creating problems for Democrats, others are calling for swift dismissal or final vote.\n\nThe Democratic senators who remain in the presidential race have all said publicly that the impeachment proceedings are more important than political concerns. But advisers to multiple candidates have been inquiring about the potential timing behind the scenes, and Sanders has spoken about the potential challenges of an extended trial if the Democratic-controlled House votes to impeach Trump and sends the case to the Senate.\n\n\"We will do our best to get back to Iowa, to get to New Hampshire, to get to all the states that we have to,\" Sanders said Sunday at an event in Charles City, Iowa, when asked about a potential trial in January. \"But there's no question it will make our life a little bit more difficult.\"\n\nWarren said Wednesday that she has \"constitutional responsibilities\" and \"if the House goes forward and sends impeachment over to the Senate, then I will be there for the trial.\"\n\nOne top adviser to a senator running for president, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss strategy, said the campaign was already rearranging fundraising and campaign schedules to prepare for a trial.\n\n\"We've been all but told that January is when we should expect not to have them,\" the person said. \"And that in December is when we should expect to have them.\"\n\nThe issue of trial length came up during a closed-door lunch of all GOP senators Wednesday, when Republicans speculated about whether the House would hand over the process to them either before or after Christmas, according to multiple people in attendance.\n\nInside the lunch, McConnell had little guidance for his ranks, outside of saying the trial will go on as long as the Senate wants it to run, said the people, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to share details from the private meeting.\n\nBut McConnell's deputies, as well as most of his ranks, believe a longer trial is the likelier outcome \u2014 which they say would give Trump and his defense team sufficient time to make his case.\n\nCornyn said Wednesday that it would be difficult to find a majority in the Senate to dismiss the trial early on, even if the president's attorneys request it, \"before the evidence is presented.\"\n\n\"I think the consensus in our conference is at least that we need to proceed and take seriously the responsibility we have,\" said Sen. John Thune (S.D.), the second-ranking Senate Republican. \"How long that takes is an open question .?.?. but I suspect that, you know, it'd go on for a while.\"\n\nSen. Richard Burr (R-N.C.), who has speculated publicly that a Senate trial could run as long as eight weeks, argued during the lunch that former president Bill Clinton's impeachment proceedings in the Senate took five weeks but that Trump's case was likely to take more time because he has not admitted to any wrongdoing.\n\nClinton \"admitted that he had lied to the FBI,\" Burr said before the lunch. \"I figured it's going to take longer for them to make a case, because they don't have that.\"\n\nOne White House official said the president is not yet concentrating on a trial but has spoken with McConnell, Vice President Pence and Sen. Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.), the chairman of the Judiciary Committee, about the outlook in the chamber. Newly hired White House aides who are working on impeachment issues have also been meeting with Senate GOP staffers this month.\n\nMcConnell has not publicly committed to a timeline for a trial. \"I think it's impossible to predict how long we'll be on it or predict which motions would pass,\" the GOP leader said Wednesday.\n\nBut McConnell will not be able to set the schedule in isolation. The rules for an impeachment trial, including a process for calling witnesses, must be passed by 51 or more senators, since Pence is not able to cast a deciding vote on the question. That gives McConnell, who oversees a 53-seat Republican majority, relatively little room to maneuver.\n\nSen. Mitt Romney (R-Utah) has been a sharp critic of Trump's behavior on Ukraine, and more independent-minded senators, like Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska), could side with Democrats to force a process that Democrats accept as fair, according to a person familiar with Republican discussions.\n\nA separate group of centrist Senate Republicans facing tough reelection fights next year have been telling McConnell and colleagues that they do not want the process to be rushed, worrying that any move to quickly dispense with a trial risks giving their Democratic opponents an opening to say they did not take their duties seriously.\n\nThat view has been bolstered by Sen. Mike Lee (R-Utah), who has privately told conservative colleagues they must give breathing room to Republicans running in 2020 and let the trial play out for at least a few weeks, according to two Republican aides briefed on the talks, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the internal deliberations.\n\n\"This is going to require a great deal of work, and I don't think it should be rushed through,\" said Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine), who is up for reelection in 2020. Collins said any attempt to dismiss impeachment at the outset of a trial would be met with vocal opposition by a \"lot of senators, who'd have misgivings and reservations about treating articles of impeachment that way.\"\n\nOn the other hand, several Trump allies are planning to prepare a motion to dismiss that they could propose early on during a trial.\n\n\"The sooner we're done with this, the better,\" said Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.). \"Why just have people sitting around for this partisan sham? As soon as we possibly can dismiss this or vote along party lines, especially if the Democrats in the House limit the witnesses, I'll move to do that.\"\n\nSen. David Perdue (R-Ga.) also dismissed the prospect of a lengthy trial, saying a \"week is more than enough.\"\n\nSenate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) has been talking with Democratic senators, including those running for president, to decide the best way to approach any negotiation with McConnell about whether Democrats join in a resolution setting up the Senate process.\n\n\"Given articles of impeachment haven't even been drafted, it's impossible to know what either side would want a trial to look like,\" said a person familiar with Schumer's thinking, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss strategy. Schumer declined Wednesday to discuss his next steps but warned that a trial should not be \"truncated.\"\n\nMcConnell's general template remains the Senate impeachment trial of Clinton in early 1999, which lasted five weeks and had a bipartisan consensus at its start about how it would proceed, according to McConnell's aides and allies.\n\nDiscussions on Senate rules in 1999 broke down repeatedly before the chamber finally agreed on a compromise by a margin of 100-to-0.\n\nAn initial proposal by Sens. Joseph I. Lieberman (D-Conn.) and Slade Gorton (R-Wash.) to make a full trial contingent on a two-thirds supermajority finding Clinton's alleged offenses impeachable faced fierce objection from Republicans.\n\n\"When I presented it to the Republican conference, they did everything but stone me and throw me out in the hall,\" said former senator Trent Lott (Miss.), who was then the Republican leader.\n\nA compromise was reached later in a closed-door meeting for all senators in the Old Senate Chamber, when Sens. Phil Gramm (R-Tex.) and Edward M. Kennedy (D-Mass.) agreed they should start the trial before deciding whether witnesses would be called before the full body.\n\nLott said McConnell and Schumer might have a more challenging time striking a deal.\n\n\"This is a different situation,\" he said. \"You do have a divided Congress. You do have a president who has agitated a lot of people.\""

        "text": "Read William Taylor's prepared opening remarks below.\n\nMr. Chairman, I am appearing today at the Committee's request to provide my perspective on the events that are the subject of the Committee's inquiry. I want to emphasize at the outset that, while I am aware that the Committee has requested my testimony as part of impeachment proceedings, I am not here to take one side or the other, or to advocate for any particular outcome of these proceedings. My sole purpose is to provide facts as I know them about the incidents in question as well as my views about the strategic importance of Ukraine to the United States.\n\nBy way of background, it has been a privilege for me to serve our country and the American people for more than fifty years, starting as a cadet at West Point, then as an infantry officer for six years, including with the 101st Airborne Division in Vietnam; then at the Department of Energy; then as a member of a Senate staff; then at NATO; then with the State Department here and abroad\u2014in Afghanistan, Iraq, Jerusalem, and Ukraine. I retired from the State Department in 2009 to join the U.S. Institute of Peace.\n\nI am neither a career member of the Foreign Service nor of the civil service. I am non-partisan and have been appointed to my positions by every president from President Reagan to President Trump.\n\nLet me summarize my main points.\n\nFirst, Ukraine is a strategic partner of the United States, important for the security of our country as well as Europe. Ukraine is on the front line in the conflict with a newly aggressive Russia.\n\nSecond, even as we sit here today, the Russians are attacking Ukrainian soldiers in their own country and have been for the last four years. I saw this on the front line last week; the day I was there a Ukrainian soldier was killed and four were wounded.\n\nThird, the security assistance we provide is crucial to Ukraine's defense and to the protection of the soldiers I met last week. It demonstrates to Ukrainians\u2014and Russians\u2014that we are Ukraine's reliable strategic partner. It is clearly in our national interest to deter further Russian aggression.\n\nAnd finally, as the Committee is aware, I wrote that withholding security assistance in exchange for help with a domestic political campaign in the United States would be \"crazy.\" I believed that then, and I believe it now.\n\nLet me tell you why.\n\nOn May 28 of this year, I met with Secretary of State Mike Pompeo who asked me to rejoin the State Department and return to Kyiv to lead our embassy in Ukraine. It was\u2014and is\u2014a critical time in U.S.-Ukraine relations.\n\nI had served as Ambassador to Ukraine from 2006 to 2009, having been nominated by George W. Bush, and, in the intervening 10 years, had stayed engaged with Ukraine. Across the responsibilities I have had in public service, Ukraine is the highlight, and so Secretary Pompeo's offer to return as Chief of Mission was compelling.\n\nSince I left Ukraine in 2009, the country had continued to turn toward the West. But in 2013, Vladimir Putin was so threatened by the prospect of Ukraine joining the European Union that he tried to bribe the Ukrainian president. This triggered mass protests in the winter of 2013 that drove that president to flee to Russia in February 2014, but not before his forces killed a hundred Ukrainian protesters in central Kyiv.\n\nDays later Mr. Putin invaded Crimea, holding a sham referendum at the point of Russian army rifles. The Russians absurdly claimed that 97% voted to join Russia. In early April, Putin sent his army and security forces into southeastern Ukraine to generate illegal armed formations and puppet governments in what we know as Donbas. 14,000 Ukrainians have died in the war in Donbas. More die each week.\n\nIn July 2014, these Russian-led forces in Donbas shot down a civilian airliner en route from Amsterdam to Malaysia, killing all 298 people on board.\n\nWe, the Europeans, and most of the West imposed economic sanctions and kicked the Russians out of the G-8. Beginning in 2014, we and NATO began to provide military assistance to Ukraine's armed forces in the form of training, advice, military equipment, and weapons.\n\nIt is this security assistance that is at the heart of the controversy that we are discussing today. The pro-Russian president who was run out of Kyiv in 2014 had let the Ukrainian armed forces deteriorate to the point of ruin. In response to the Russian invasion, the new Ukrainian authorities\u2014with an amazing outpouring of support from regular Ukrainian people\u2014rebuilt the army, nearly from scratch, spending more than 5% of Ukrainian GDP on defense since the war started. The whole Ukrainian nation fiercely responded to the Russian attack. The nation united like never before. A rag-tag army developed into a strong fighting force. And the United States played a vital role.\n\nSince 2014, you in Congress have provided over $1.6 billion in military assistance to Ukraine. The security assistance provides small unit training at an army base near Lviv in the west of the country. It provides ambulances, night vision devices, communications equipment, counter- battery radar, navy ships\u2014and finally, weapons. This security assistance demonstrates our commitment to resist aggression and defend freedom.\n\nDuring the 2014 to 2016 period, I was serving outside of government and joined two other former ambassadors to Ukraine in urging Obama administration officials at the State Department, Defense Department, and other agencies to provide lethal defensive weapons to Ukraine in order to deter further Russian aggression. I also supported much stronger sanctions on Russia. I was pleased when the Trump administration provided Javelin anti-tank missiles and enacted stronger sanctions.\n\n MOST READ\nbiden-25057.jpg\nWhite House believes massive Dem bailout may be needed to pass debt ceiling compromise\nRon DeSantis Has a Problem. It's Florida.\nFlorida school limits access to Amanda Gorman's inaugural poem after parental complaint\nThe Media Has Got Ron DeSantis Nailed\nHouse Republicans are dealmaking newbies \u2014 and that could be a problem\nAll to say, I cared about Ukraine's future and the important U.S. interests there. So, when Secretary Pompeo asked me to go back to Kyiv, I wanted to say \"yes.\"\n\nBut it was not an easy decision. The former Ambassador, Masha Yovanovitch, had been treated poorly, caught in a web of political machinations both in Kyiv and in Washington. I feared that those problems were still present. I consulted both my wife and a respected former senior Republican official who has been a mentor. I will tell you that my wife, in no uncertain terms, strongly opposed the idea. The mentor counseled: if your country asks you to do something, you do it\u2014 if you can be effective.\n\nI could be effective only if the U.S. policy of strong support for Ukraine\u2014strong diplomatic support along with robust security, economic, and technical assistance\u2014were to continue, and if I had the backing of the Secretary of State to implement that policy. And I worried about what I had heard concerning the role of Rudy Giuliani, who had made several controversial statements about Ukraine and U.S. policy toward the country.\n\nSo during my meeting with Secretary Pompeo on May 28, I made clear to him and the others present that if U.S. policy toward Ukraine changed, he would not want me posted there and I could not stay. He assured me that the policy of strong support for Ukraine would continue and that he would support me in defending that policy.\n\nWith that understanding, I agreed to go back to Kyiv. Because I was appointed by the Secretary but not reconfirmed by the Senate, my official position was Charge? d'Affaires ad interim. In effect, I was the acting ambassador to Ukraine.\n\n*****\n\nI returned to Kyiv on June 17, carrying the original copy of a letter President Trump signed the day after I met with the Secretary. In that letter, President Trump congratulated President Zelenskyy on his election victory and invited him to a meeting in the Oval Office.\n\nBut once I arrived in Kyiv, I discovered a weird combination of encouraging, confusing, and ultimately alarming circumstances."

Bill Cassidy of Louisiana, Kevin Cramer of North Dakota, Mike Crapo of Idaho, Ted Cruz of Texas, Steve Daines of Montana, Deb Fischer of Nebraska, Ben Sasse of Nebraska, Thom Tillis of North Carolina, Mike Enzi of Wyoming and Jerry Moran of Kansas.\n\nTrump tweeted Monday that he would release a transcript of the April 21 call this week but the White House has yet to publicly share the document. The administration previously released a summary of Trump's July 25 call with Zelensky, which showed he requested the Ukrainian president investigate the Biden family.\n\nA whistleblower complaint over the July call helped spark House Democrats to begin a formal impeachment inquiry into the president.\n\nThe first call is expected to be far less controversial than Trump's July 25 call with Zelensky, in which that the requested the Ukrainian president investigate the Biden family.\n\nLt. Colonel Alexander Vindman, a Ukraine specialist with the National Security Council, testified to impeachment investigators that he listened in on both the April 21 and July 25 calls. He characterized the April call in his deposition as \"positive\" and said Trump \"expressed his desire to work with President Zelensky and extended an invitation to visit the White House.\"\n\nA possible release of the new transcript comes as the House is holding public hearings as part of the next phase of its impeachment investigation. The House's impeachment inquiry is looking into whether the president abused his power by pressuring Ukraine to investigate his political rivals in exchange for aid and a coveted White House visit.\n\nThe White House did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nIt's at least the fourth such lunch with Republican senators at the White House this fall as the president faces removal from office."

        "text": "Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., appeared to take a shot at billionaire Michael Bloomberg and former Massachusetts Gov. Deval Patrick for their late entries to the Democratic presidential primary, with less than three months until the Iowa caucuses.\n\nPatrick, who led Massachusetts from 2007-2015, announced Thursday morning in a video on social media and an email to supporters that he would jump into the race. He later officially filed for the New Hampshire primary, one day before the deadline to do so. Bloomberg, who has not made an official campaign announcement yet, has filed to have his name on the Democratic primary ballot in Alabama and Arkansas. Sources close to Bloomberg tell Fox News that it's unlikely the former New York City mayor would make any 2020 presidential announcement this week.\n\n\"Call me radical, but maybe instead of setting ablaze hundreds of millions of dollars on multiple plutocratic, long-shot, very-late presidential bids, we instead invest hundreds of millions into winning majorities of state legislatures across the United States?\" Ocasio-Cortez tweeted Thursday afternoon. \"Just a thought!\"\n\nPatrick and Bloomberg would both face similar obstacles to gaining traction in the presidential race. Their late starts mean their opponents will have an advantage in organization for key states as well as a significant head start on fundraising. Patrick, specifically, will have to overcome the fact he does not have national name recognition.\n\nAdditionally, due to the size of the 2020 field, the Democratic Party has set benchmarks in polling and fundraising for candidates to qualify for a spot in the party's nationally-televised debates. To make it on the stage for the December debate, Bloomberg and Patrick would have to garner 4 percent in at least four qualifying national or single-state polls or get 6 percent support in two single-state polls while also attracting at least 200,000 unique donors with a minimum of 800 in 20 separate states.\n\nMeanwhile, Democrats will now completely control the Virginia state government for the first time in over two decades after a successful election day last week, lending credence to Ocasio-Cortez's assertion that there is some ground to be gained for Democrats in the 2020 state elections. Currently, Republicans control 29 state legislatures while Democrats control just 19, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures.\n\nRepublicans also ridiculed Patrick's move to enter the 2020 race.\n\n\"There's already one Massachusetts elitist liberal running in the Democrat field, yet Deval Patrick must think she, nor any of the other candidates aren't good enough. Reminder: Patrick doesn't stand a chance against President Trump either,\" Republican National Committee spokesman Steve Guest said in a statement.\n\nA late entry to the race does not mean a candidate can't make waves. Bloomberg's fellow billionaire Tom Steyer didn't commit to joining the presidential field until July, and he's qualified for the November debate. It remains to be seen if Patrick or Bloomberg can create as much traction as the longtime progressive booster in a significantly shorter period of time."

African-American turnout during the early voting period jumped significantly above primary levels, a critical piece of Edwards' strategy to win a second term. In addition to enthusiasm among black voters, Edwards also needs crossover support from some Republicans and independents.\n\nTo help him meet that benchmark, Edwards is reaching out to backers of Republican U.S. Rep. Ralph Abraham, the primary's third-place finisher. While Abraham endorsed Rispone, he's done little publicly to boost Rispone, outside of his attendance at the president's events. The GOP also is targeting Abraham's voters, setting both of Trump's rallies in north Louisiana, where Abraham lives and saw strong support.\n\nLouisiana has the last of three Southern governor's races this year, all targets of intense interest from the GOP and Trump. While Republicans kept the seat in Mississippi, they appear to have lost Kentucky's governorship, though Republican Matt Bevin has yet to concede there."

On Tuesday, civil rights activists protested at the restaurant, demanding that the employee be terminated.\n\n\"We've chosen to not fire the individual based upon his remorse in this situation,\" CEO Kyle Shivers explained. \"One of our cultural aspects here is to extend grace to those that are teachable.\"\n\nIt's the same message COO Ernie Vega gave media and protesters on Tuesday.\n\n\"We want to do all we can to make all of our staff feel very welcome,\" Vega explained.\n\nRev.

        "text": "Late last year, a little-known deputy in the San Francisco Public Defender's Office asked for a meeting with one of the city's top political consultants for progressive candidates and campaigns.\n\nFittingly, they talked in the back garden of Progressive Grounds, a coffee shop on Cortland Avenue in Bernal Heights. Chesa Boudin wanted Jim Stearns to help him with a long-shot endeavor: becoming San Francisco's next district attorney. Boudin was hopeful, despite never having prosecuted a case and having a controversial background that included an imprisoned father and a stint working for Hugo Ch\u00e1vez, the late president of Venezuela who was criticized for trampling human rights.\n\n\"Candidates always want to know, \u2018What's the game plan for winning?'\" Stearns said. \"I said, \u2018It's a really long way from where you are now to the finish line.'\"\n\nStearns didn't even want the gig \u2014 he'd worked on Kamala Harris' campaign for district attorney in 2003 and knew district attorney races are more complex than regular political races like mayor and supervisor.\n\n\"Literally after spending an hour with Chesa, I was extremely inspired by both his story and his agenda for change, his intelligence and charisma,\" Stearns said. \"I was like, \u2018Let's do this.'\"\n\nAnd, boy, did they. Over the weekend, it became official: In less than a year, Boudin had gone from that unknown hopeful to San Francisco's district attorney-elect, beating Suzy Loftus, the candidate so formidable, former District Attorney George Gasc\u00f3n announced he wouldn't seek re-election shortly after she entered the race.\n\nSo how did Boudin do it?\n\nAsked this question, the winner himself texted, \"Hard work, a broad, diverse coalition of grassroots supporters and a consistent, principled message rooted in a lifetime of experience with a broken system.\"\n\nThat's surely true. But elections also hang on political strategy \u2014 or lack thereof. Conversations with Stearns, as well as Loftus' campaign consultant and other political insiders, pointed to several key reasons that the neck-and-neck race finally tipped Boudin's way.\n\nYou know both stories by now unless you've been living under a rock.\n\nBreed grew up in rough public housing projects, lost her sister to a drug overdose and saw her brother go to prison for manslaughter. She overcame all that to become mayor of her own hometown \u2014 only the second woman ever and the first woman of color.\n\nBoudin's story is even more movie-worthy. His parents were left-wing radicals in the Weather Underground and served as getaway drivers in an October 1981 robbery that wound up killing three people. Boudin, 14 months old at the time of the incident, was adopted by Bill Ayers and Bernardine Dohrn, also Weather Underground radicals. He graduated from Yale and Oxford University, where he was a Rhodes scholar.\n\nHis biological father remains in prison in New York; Boudin and his fiancee visited him there after the election.\n\nStearns said he and Boudin at the outset agreed on two strategies. One was that his story was \"foundational to his life and his mission,\" and he would need to talk about it early and often. Two was that he would speak openly and proudly about being a public defender. He could link both to his desire to fix the broken criminal justice system.\n\n\"It was just this gut instinct on his and my part that we didn't want to sugarcoat anything,\" Stearns said. \"If people were looking for change, that was going to be real proof that he was completely different than all the other candidates.\"\n\nThe appointment: After Gasc\u00f3n announced he wasn't running for another term, the race was supposed to be the first wide-open one for district attorney in more than a century. But then Gasc\u00f3n quit Oct. 18 to seek the same job in Los Angeles, 18 days before election day.\n\nBreed almost immediately appointed Loftus to the post of interim D.A., though she could have waited until Nov. 5 and appointed the winner. The gamble gave Loftus a couple of weeks to prove she could do the job, but it also put a big target on her back. I heard a lot of voters say they were turned off by the mayor putting her thumb on the scale, and it's likely Loftus lost votes because of it.\n\n\"A lot of voters saw it as an attempt to rig the system,\" said Jon Golinger, a progressive political consultant and a professor of election law at Golden Gate University. \"Voters don't like to feel like the decision was taken away from them.\"\n\nRanked-choice voting: A lot of political observers, including, I'll confess, yours truly, thought Boudin might win in first-choice votes, but assumed Loftus would be the ultimate winner because of ranked-choice voting.\n\nThe two other candidates, Leif Dautch and Nancy Tung, seemed far more aligned with Loftus. Voters who backed those two would surely give Loftus a nod and leave Boudin, the far-left public defender, off their ballots altogether.\n\nRight? Nope.\n\nDautch was eliminated first, and among his supporters, roughly the same number of people voted for Loftus second as didn't choose anyone for second place. Boudin and Tung got big shares of his second-choice votes.\n\nTung was eliminated next. Of her 46,600 votes, Loftus got just 17,358 and Boudin got 13,151. Others had either ranked Dautch or nobody. This was surprising considering Tung was more conservative than Loftus, with Boudin on the opposite end of the spectrum.\n\nOnce ranked-choice voting was complete, Boudin beat Loftus by 2,825 votes, showing how she could have easily won by grabbing a relatively small chunk of the other candidates' backup choices. So why didn't she make it official and pair up with Dautch or Tung?\n\nJason McDaniel, associate professor of political science, said it was simply poor political strategy on the part of the Loftus campaign.\n\n\"They needed to do a ranked-choice voting strategy,\" McDaniel said. \"Voters can listen to those signals, but the candidates have to send them in a strong, clear way.\"\n\nIn a low-turnout, under-the-radar election, candidates couldn't assume voters would know who was politically aligned.\n\nTung was a natural choice for Chinese voters, who make up a third of the city's voters, and Boudin campaigned heavily in the Chinese community. He speaks some Cantonese and Mandarin and won the endorsement of the Sing Tao Daily, the largest Chinese language newspaper in the Bay Area. That could be a reason he won a lot of Tung's second-choice votes, even though their politics were at opposite ends of the candidate spectrum.\n\nNicole Derse, Loftus' campaign consultant, said Loftus did have conversations with the other candidates, but an official pairing became a no-go after Breed appointed her as interim district attorney.\n\n\"Once she got the appointment, it became really difficult to build those bridges with those candidates, because they were really focused on critiquing Suzy's appointment and less focused on communicating the positions that they shared,\" Derse said.\n\nThat seems late in the game to develop a ranked-choice voting strategy anyway. I moderated a KRON-TV debate among the four candidates on Sept. 27 and asked each one who would get their second-choice vote. Tung said Loftus. Loftus said no one would get her second-choice vote.\n\nThe excitement: Of all the candidates, Boudin arguably generated the most enthusiasm among his supporters \u2014 and gained national attention for being part of a movement of electing progressive prosecutors.\n\nHe won the endorsements of U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders, singer John Legend and the co-founders of Black Lives Matter. A lot of money from outside San Francisco and California came in to support him, including from civil rights activist Shaun King's Real Justice PAC.\n\n(Those over-the-top Police Officers Association mailers against Boudin likely backfired \u2014 and they didn't even say whom to vote for as an alternative.)\n\nNathan Ballard, a Democratic strategist who supported Loftus, said Boudin seems cut from the same cloth as the late Public Defender Jeff Adachi, who was smart, charismatic, hard-working and had an unshakable far-left ideology.\n\n\"Chesa is the new progressive superstar who's filling the big shoes that Jeff Adachi left behind,\" Ballard said. \"That sort of authenticity is compelling, especially to progressive voters who tend to look for a savior.\"\n\nDerse said voters could be let down, though, once that sheen has worn off.\n\n\"The national press painted Chesa as a golden boy, but they didn't focus on what he was actually going to do as D.A.,\" she said. \"Too few San Franciscans probably understand his priorities and his plans as district attorney. They probably don't know that he's never prosecuted a case. They probably don't know the extent of the crimes that he doesn't want to try.\"\n\nWinning was unlikely, but Boudin has done it. Now he has an even harder job: helping to run San Francisco.\n\nSan Francisco Chronicle columnist Heather Knight appears Sundays and Tuesdays.

He cited the \"human element\" of the program and praised DACA recipients, also known as Dreamers, in his letter. \n\nHis reversal added to the long history of Tennessee leaders in the battle for Dreamers. \n\nDespite the efforts of lawmakers, activists and other leaders to create a permanent solution for Dreamers, Trump ordered DACA to end in 2017 \u2014 a decision that has since been blocked by federal courts. \n\nNow, the fate of DACA rests on a looming U.S. Supreme Court case, set to be heard on Tuesday. \n\n\"All my dreams, all my ambitions, are hanging on one little thread \u2014 it's yes or no,\" Dreamer and Nashville resident Cesar Virto, 30, said. \n\nNASHVILLE DREAMERS:The stories ahead of the Supreme Court case that will determine their future\n\nVirto is one of 7,790 Dreamers who live in Tennessee, according to a report by the Center for American Progress. He has built a life for himself in Nashville \u2014 he is an investor, owns a house, runs an Airbnb, works for Lyft and has a dog that has a following on Instagram. But he wrestles with the constant uncertainty of his future in the U.S.\n\n\"At the end of the day, it could all be taken away,\" Virto said. \n\nAfter the hearing, the high court is expected to rule on DACA by the end of its term in June 2020. \n\nHow Tennessee immigrants, advocates urged Slatery to change his mind\nThree months after signing his name to the letter pressuring Trump to end DACA in 2017, Slatery said he no longer believed that was the best approach. He also urged U.S. Sen. Lamar Alexander, R-Tennessee, and then-U.S. Sen. Bob Corker, R-Tennessee, to advocate for Dreamers in Congress.  \n\n\"It is my sincere hope that the important issues raised by the States will be resolved by the people's representatives in the halls of Congress, not in a courtroom,\" Slatery said in the Sept. 1, 2017 letter. \n\nBefore his decision, representatives from the Tennessee Immigrant & Refugee Rights Coalition met with Slatery, amid months of protests and efforts to convince him and other Tennessee leaders to support DACA. \n\nStephanie Teatro, co-executive director for TIRRC, was part of the meeting with Slatery. She said they went in with what she called an \"audacious goal\" of getting him to remove his name from the letter. She wanted Slatery to understand the impact of DACA on the lives of Tennessee Dreamers, along with how it would affect the state if they were all deported.\n\nTeatro said she was surprised to hear of Slatery's change of heart following their meeting, but also encouraged.\n\n\"We've heard, time and time again, from elected officials that once they get to know folks and they get to understand the issue on a more personal level, when you turn down the heat on the conversation about immigration and instead get to understand how our current laws affect your friends, colleagues, neighbors ... minds change,\" Teatro said. \n\nIn his letter, Slatery spoke highly of Dreamers and wrote about their place in the U.S.  \n\n\"Many of the DACA recipients, some of whose records I reviewed, have outstanding accomplishments and laudable ambitions, which if achieved, will be of great benefit and service to our country,\" Slatery said. \"They have an appreciation for the opportunities afforded them by our country.\"\n\nSlatery declined to comment further on DACA and the upcoming Supreme Court case when contacted by The Tennessean last month. \n\nHow Alexander, Corker influenced the DACA conversation\nAlexander supported a bipartisan effort to create a pathway to citizenship for Dreamers in February 2018, saying he wanted to \"see a result\" after months of debate on the Senate floor. \n\nThe bill ultimately failed. \n\nPreviously, he voted for a bill in 2013 that would have allowed Dreamers to apply for permanent residency, along with addressing border security and immigration reform. The bill passed the Senate but was not considered in the House. \n\n\"President Trump and the bipartisan members of Congress ought to be able to agree on a proposal that both secures our borders and provides a solution for DACA recipients,\" Alexander said in a statement, after being contacted by The Tennessean last month. \n\nCorker also voted in favor of the 2013 legislation and said he strongly supports a path to citizenship for Dreamers. When the 2013 legislation passed the Senate, Corker said it inspired him, even though the House did not take it up.\n\n\"The feeling of having passed legislation that finally dealt with (Dreamers) was one of the more meaningful moments of my career,\" Corker said in an interview with The Tennessean last month.\n\nCorker and Alexander were in the mix as Congress worked to negotiate a bipartisan deal to avert a government shutdown in January 2018. The deal largely rested on the protection of Dreamers in exchange for increased border security funding in the federal budget. Efforts failed and the government shut down from January 20 to 22 in 2018.\n\n\"I've met many of the young Dreamers who have aspirations, just like my kids do, who are held in limbo,\" Corker said in an interview with The Tennessean last month. \"This is, to me, an issue that should have been resolved a long time ago.\" \n\nAfter the shutdown lifted, the Senate had a series of immigration bill votes on Feb. 15, 2018, Corker voted against two measures to protect Dreamers, and in favor of a Trump-supported bill that would have provided a pathway to citizenship for Dreamers. None of the bills passed. \n\nWhile immigration and Dreamers have remained a topic of discussion in Congress, Corker said in last month's interview that he was doubtful that his former colleagues will resolve anything before the 2020 election. \n\n\"Each side, it seems, likes to use this issue to stir up their base,\" Corker said. \"It's no question that the president thinks this is an issue that galvanizes his base. To resolve it is not electorally productive for him.\" \n\nSen. Marsha Blackburn, who replaced Corker in the Senate in January 2019, said that it is important to realize that DACA is not a federal law, but a program unilaterally established by Obama as an executive order. \n\n\"We cannot possibly consider codifying DACA when we have not yet addressed the high volume of illegal immigrants pouring over our southern border,\" she said in an emailed statement to the Tennessean in October.\n\n\"Amnesty is not a real solution to our broken immigration system, and the DREAM Act represents yet another form of amnesty ... It's time for the Democrats in Congress to stop playing games with our nation's sovereignty and work with us to provide much needed resources.\""

        "text": "President Donald Trump's re-election campaign is ramping up a Facebook ad blitz against efforts to impeach him, buying more ads on the topic in recent weeks than all the Democratic White House candidates combined.\n\nThe contrast between the president and the Democratic field is a sign that Trump is betting the Democratic-led congressional impeachment inquiry, which entered a new phase on Wednesday with public hearings, could help him win the November 2020 election. Public opinion polls show support for impeachment is concentrated among Democrats.\n\nLast Friday alone, the president sent out more than 400 Facebook ads asking for donations that would be rewarded with a personalized \"Impeachment Defense Membership Card.\"\n\nThe ads are designed to energize Trump's supporters, encouraging them to turn out to vote in next year's election, and help him win over independents skeptical of the impeachment process, said Ford O'Connell, a Republican strategist.\n\n\"The Democrats are fired up no matter what. He has to make sure that he's able to match and exceed the Democrats' intensity,\" said O'Connell, who worked on the 2008 presidential campaign of Republican John McCain.\n\nTrump also launched new ads on Wednesday calling the hearings \"fake\" and a \"scam,\" while separately asking supporters via email to donate money to help him fight impeachment.\n\nThe U.S. House of Representatives inquiry focuses on a July 25 telephone call in which Trump asked Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden, a leading contender in the Democratic race for the right to challenge Trump in 2020, and Biden's son Hunter, who had served as a director for Ukrainian energy company Burisma.\n\nTrump made his request after withholding $391 million in security aid approved by Congress to help fight Russian-backed separatists in eastern Ukraine.\n\nThe president has denied any wrongdoing.\n\nThe Democratic candidates typically combine to run more ads than the president every day. But Trump's campaign and backers pumped out more than 2,900 Facebook ads in the two weeks through last Friday that mention \"impeach\" or \"impeachment,\" according to a Reuters analysis of Facebook ad data.\n\nThe 15 Democratic candidates running new ads in the same period had just more than 200 mentioning impeachment, according to the data, which was gathered by computer scientists at the Tandon School of Engineering at New York University. tmsnrt.rs/2pekL1J\n\n\u2018FIGHT OF OUR LIVES'\n\nThe Trump campaign declined to comment specifically on the ads, but communications director Tim Murtaugh said the impeachment proceedings were getting Trump supporters \"more fired up.\"\n\n\"We are in the fight of our lives right now,\" the text of one of the ads said. \"The President is counting on YOU to be there with him on the front lines of this nasty impeachment battle.\"\n\nBiden has called for Trump's impeachment in speeches and has run a few dozen ads in recent weeks inviting viewers to respond to the question: \"Should Trump be impeached?\"\n\nHis ads have focused more on attacking Trump over past incendiary remarks, including the president's comment in 2017 that there were \"very fine people on both sides\" at a rally by white nationalists in Charlottesville, Virginia, where a self-described neo-Nazi drove his car into a crowd of counterprotesters, killing a woman.\n\nU.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren, another leading Democratic contender, has called for Trump's impeachment in Facebook ads. But her ads in recent weeks have focused more on her plans for universal health insurance and improving access to higher education.\n\nFor graphic on impeachment wars, click:"

        "text": "Deval Patrick, the former two-term governor of Massachusetts and the state's first black chief executive, formally announced a bid for the Democratic presidential nomination in a sharp reversal from his 2018 decision to not pursue a run -- injecting more uncertainty into an unsettled primary less than three months before the first votes.\n\n\"I've had the chance to live my American dream,\" he said in announcement video Thursday morning. \"But over the years, I've seen the path to that dream closing off bit by bit. The anxiety and even anger that I saw in my neighbors on the South Side, the sense that the government and the economy were letting us down, were no longer about us, is what folks feel all over America today in all kinds of communities.\"\n\n\"I am today announcing my candidacy for president of the United States,\" he added.\n\nAfter his announcement Thursday morning, Patrick headed to New Hampshire's State House to personally file paperwork for the first-in-the nation's primary ballot -- a day before the deadline.\n\nHe is expected to then head to California, the delegate-rich Super Tuesday state voting in early March, before heading to the other early states, according to sources close to Patrick.\n\nIn Concord, Patrick dismissed concerns that his entry is \"late\" instead arguing \"from the perspective of the voters, its early.\"\n\n\"It's another option,\" he told reporters of his candidacy after he filed. \"If we want solutions that last, they can't be solutions that feel to the voting public as if they are just Democratic solutions...I think a little humility about that, a little openness from others about making a place for their ideas and perspectives, is actually the way you get to solutions that aren't just Democratic solutions but are American solutions.\"\n\nPatrick, a close ally of former President Barack Obama, seeks to position himself as the candidate who can unify the party and outlined a key ground rule of his campaign: he will not \"climb up by tearing anyone down.\"\n\n\"We are going to compete and compete robustly, and we're going to compete not just by making this contrast, but we're going to show differences in the way that campaign,\" he said.\n\nPrior to his anticipated announcement, Patrick called political allies, officials and potential aides earlier this week to inform them of his intentions to launch an 11th-hour campaign for the nomination, according to Democratic Party sources, nearly a year after he ruled it out.\n\n\"I hope to help in whatever way I can. It just won't be as a candidate for president,\" he wrote in 2018, as he signaled that his concerns with launching a White House run were with \"the cruelty of our elections process.\"\n\nPatrick's late candidacy, 11 months into the primary, reflects a splintered field grappling with concerns over the strength of the existing pool of nearly two dozen contenders and underscores Democrats' urgency to oust President Donald Trump.\n\nWhile four candidates steadily occupy the top spots in recent national and early state polling -- moderates Joe Biden, the former vice president, and Pete Buttigieg, the mayor of South Bend, Ind., and progressive stalwarts, Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders -- the protracted contest remains fluid and without an outright front-runner.\n\nIn the latest Iowa poll, only 28% of likely Democratic caucus-goers, the first voters in the country in early February, are firmly settled on their pick.\n\nPatrick, who hails from the same state as Warren -- who said in interview last week that Patrick would top the list of potential members of her cabinet -- could complicate the Democratic front-runner's strategy in New Hampshire, a notion she denied after filing for the early state's primary ballot Wednesday.\n\nHe told reporters Thursday he spoke to Warren Wednesday night and called it \"a kind of hard conversation.\"\n\n\"She has the best and most disciplined campaign out there,\" he said. \"But I think the actual business of advancing an agenda once elected is different...[You have] to add, not push away from the beginning and that's not a comment just on my friend Sen. Warren and her campaign but a comment on how the conversation is evolving in the field.\"\n\nWhile a shakeup to the presidential contest this late has seldom proved successful in recent history, Patrick argues there is an opening for him.\n\n\"I admire and respect the candidates in the Democratic field,\" Patrick said in his announcement video. \"They bring a richness of ideas and experience and a depth of character that makes me proud to be a Democrat. But if the character of the candidates is an issue in every election, this time it's about the character of the country.\"\n\n\"This time is about more than removing an unpopular and divisive leader -- as important as that is -- but about delivering instead for you,\" he said, before recognizing the challenges ahead. \"We will build as we climb ... this won't be easy.\"\n\nBut the newest entrant faces significant hurdles and long odds. While the other candidates have spent months aggressively campaigning, expanding their ground-games and amassing war chests, Patrick's nascent campaign will need to quickly build up the infrastructure to compete and also raise cash even quicker.\n\nHe will also have to contend with his ties to Bain Capital, the private equity firm where he holds the title of managing director and was co-founded by Utah Sen. Mitt Romney, in a cycle in which at least two of the front-runners are shunning big dollar fundraisers and the billionaire class.\n\nDespite his last-minute entry into the race, one source who has spoken to the former governor told ABC News Wednesday Patrick is clear-eyed about his prospects and has started to fill out a team -- believing he can be competitive in neighboring New Hampshire, South Carolina, home to a significantly large African American voting population among the four early nominating states, and on Super Tuesday.\n\nPatrick has already missed the filing deadline in two southern states -- Arkansas and Alabama -- a potential disadvantage since those primaries are slated for March 3. Another hurdle lies in Michigan, where the deadline for parties to submit their list of candidates fell on Wednesday; he will now need to gather 11,345 signatures and petition to get on the ballot by Dec. 13.\n\nBut Tim Murray, former Massachusetts lieutenant governor, who spoke with Patrick last year about a possible run but not about his plans this year, said his former boss had \"a lot to offer\" and was \"not afraid of risk.\"\n\n\"People will say, 'If you're going to make this decision, you should have made it already' -- but I think, he's not afraid of risk. He's not afraid to lose,\" he said. \"He thinks he has a vision that will offer value.\"\n\nPatrick might not be the only late entry into the still-crowded primary. Former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg has moved closer to formally joining the crowded field, after filing to qualify for Alabama's and Arkansas' primaries over the last week to keep his options open as he weighs his own last-minute run amid concerns over the current field's ability to defeat Trump.\n\nBloomberg has also requested a petition from Tennessee's secretary of state on Nov. 12 to gain access to the ballot ahead of the state's filing deadline next month -- signaling another step towards possibly declaring a bid as the field grows by one.\n\nABC News' Sasha Pezenik contributed to this report."

Same Swamp.\"\n\nFormer Obama administration aides-turned-podcasters dissected the hearings in real time. They broadcast their running conversation on Slack, an instant messaging platform popular in workplaces, over YouTube to thousands of left-leaning followers.\n\nAnd partisans on both sides of the aisle used Twitter to debate the significance of a revelation by William Taylor, the top diplomat in Ukraine, that one of his staff members overheard a telephone conversation in which Trump discussed \"the investigations.\"\n\nSo went the national conversation surrounding the first presidential impeachment hearings of the hyperpartisan, social media era.\n\nIt is a moment when influence and misinformation efforts move at lightning speed and with a sophistication that would have been unimaginable when the nation last went through a presidential impeachment more than 20 years ago, an era when dialup modems and AOL message boards powered the digital town square.\n\nEven before the Democratic House investigators' counsel Daniel Goldman could end his first round of questioning, Trump backers labeled the hearing an inconsequential #Snoozefest.\n\n\"For as much time as the Democrats have spent trying to orchestrate \"political theater\" they have done a terrible job,\" presidential son Eric Trump declared on Twitter. \"This clown show is horribly boring. There is not a single person outside the beltway who is engaged in this nonsense. Can't wait to win again in 2020! #DCSucks.\"\n\nTommy Vietor, a former Obama White House spokesman and co-host of Pod Save America, applauded Schiff for keeping early questioning focused on Taylor's revelation that a staff member overheard a telephone conversation between Trump and Gordon Sondland, an ambassador to the European Union, that he found concerning.\n\nTaylor said the staffer asked Sondland what President Trump thought about Ukraine. Sondland responded that Trump cared more about investigating Biden.\n\n\"Really smart of Schiff to start with the new revelations, get Taylor to repeat it,\" Vietor wrote in a real-time Slack commentary posted on YouTube. \"Create more snippets to share.\"\n\nSome on the left pushed #TrumpBribery, a hashtag used nearly 50,000 times before the hearings even kicked off. Democrats, who have at times struggled to craft an easily explained narrative around Trump's conduct with Ukraine, celebrated its success.\n\n\"BOOM: #TrumpBribery is trending nationally and has already been tweeted over 10,000 times. Let's keep it going!\" Scott Dworkin, co-founder of the Democratic Coalition Against Trump, cheered on Twitter.\n\nBefore the day's witnesses could deliver their opening statements, Republicans questioned Schiff's fairness and created a moment that supporters could share on social media at the top of the hearing.\n\nRep. Jim Jordan, an Ohio Republican, pointedly asked Schiff when he would allow members of the intelligence committee to question the whistleblower whose complaint spurred the impeachment inquiry. The whistleblower had raised concerns that Trump inappropriately pressured Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden and his son Hunter Biden's business dealings in the Ukraine.\n\n\"Of the 435 members of Congress, you are the only member who knows who that individual is,\" Jordan told Schiff. \"And your staff is the only staff of any member of Congress that has had a chance to talk to that individual. We would like that opportunity. When might that happen in this proceeding today?\"\n\nThe whistleblower contacted Schiff's staff before filing the complaint with the inspector general's office. But attorneys for the whistleblower said their client never met with Schiff.\n\n\"First, as the gentleman knows, that's a false statement,\" said Schiff, whose response was met with laughter by some in the Capitol Hill hearing room. \"I do not know the identity of the whistleblower, and I'm determined to make sure that the identity is protected.\"\n\nThe Republican National Committee posted video on Twitter of Jordan pressing Schiff but did not include the California lawmaker's response. The clip was shared from the RNC account more than 1,300 times.\n\nEven the sartorial choices of witness George Kent, a deputy secretary of state who wore a patterned green bow tie and matching pocket square, spurred partisan debate on Twitter.\n\n\"Imagine being George Kent and deciding to wear a bow tie to go up against Donald Trump,\" tweeted One America News Network host Jack Posobiec, a self-described nationalist-conservative.\n\nThe liberal commentator John Nichols was more appreciative of Kent's neckwear.\n\n\"Well, yes, it's obvious by now that George Kent's superpowers are associated with the bow tie,\" Nichols wrote."

        "text": "Senate Republicans have stalled for months on passing a bill to reauthorize the Violence Against Women Act, so on Tuesday, Democrats went ahead and introduced their own.\n\nAll 47 Democrats signed onto the House-passed VAWA bill, which would renew the landmark law through 2024 and expand protections for vulnerable populations like LGBTQ and Native American victims of domestic violence.\n\nThe bill passed the House in April with broad support from lawmakers, including 33 Republicans. It builds on current law by improving tribal access to federal crime information databases; reaffirming tribal criminal jurisdiction over non-Indigenous perpetrators of domestic violence, sexual assault, dating violence and stalking; explicitly stating that grant recipients are allowed to train staff on identifying and stopping discrimination against LGBTQ victims of abuse; and providing resources to address bullying of young people.\n\n\"Make no mistake, there's a dire need for this legislation,\" said Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.), the lead sponsor of the Senate version of the bill. \"More than a third of all women will be raped, assaulted or stalked. And the numbers are worse for Native American women, of whom some 84 percent will experience violence. Making VAWA stronger will help us lower those tragic numbers.\"\n\nThe landmark 1994 law actually lapsed in February, which is an embarrassing failure by Congress given how vital it is. It's not clear how much the lapse has already affected federal funding and grants for domestic abuse programs around the country.\n\nFeinstein had been working with Sen. Joni Ernst (R-Iowa) for eight months on a potential bipartisan VAWA bill, but their efforts fell apart last week. There appear to be three sticking points, which are the same sticking points that drove 157 House Republicans to oppose the bill in April: expanded protections for LGBTQ people and Native American women, and a gun safety provision.\n\n\"The bill goes into more and more jeopardy the longer it waits,\" Feinstein told reporters Tuesday. \"It was obvious that we weren't going to come to an agreement at that time, so I indicated to [Ernst] that I was going to introduce [the House-passed bill] and happy to continue meeting. The three points, I think, are the points of issue and we've asked for some response from the other side but haven't gotten one to date.\"\n\nThe way Ernst tells it, Democrats walked away from discussions because Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) wants to play politics.\n\n\"Election-year politics are in full swing and, once again, Democrats are putting politics ahead of people, ahead of survivors,\" Ernst said in a statement. \"I'm beyond disappointed; shame on Senate Democrats for choosing to walk away and playing politics.\"\n\nThe problem with Ernst's argument, though, is that her party controls the Senate and the bills that move. She and other Republicans had eight months to put forward some kind of VAWA bill, the House-passed version or otherwise, and have produced nothing.\n\nAn Ernst spokeswoman did not respond to a request for comment on when or if Ernst plans to introduce a Republican VAWA bill, and whether Ernst supports the expanded protections for LGBTQ people and Native American women in the House-passed bill.\n\nThe gun safety provision in the House bill was the biggest reason it drew GOP detractors. Under current federal law, only people convicted of domestic violence offenses against spouses or family members can lose their gun rights. The House VAWA bill adds people convicted of abusing their dating partners, closing the so-called \"boyfriend loophole.\" It also prohibits people convicted of misdemeanor stalking offenses from owning or buying firearms, as well as abusers subject to temporary protective orders.\n\nThe National Rifle Association was pushing Republicans to oppose the bill over that provision and warned that a vote in favor of the bill would negatively affect their NRA rating.\n\nDemocrats know their bill won't go anywhere in the Senate. But their decision to publicly sign onto the House bill is at least a show that they're trying to get something moving.\n\n\"Just so it's crystal, 100 percent clear, the reason this bill isn't going anywhere is because the NRA and the need that Mitch McConnell has to ... not bring any legislation to the floor that has any gun safety provision in there,\" Sen. Mazie Hirono (D-Hawaii) told reporters. \"That's the reason. OK? Everybody got that?\"\n\nAsked what it will take to get a VAWA bill that both parties can support in both chambers, Feinstein said the House-passed bill already has bipartisan support.\n\n\"The fact that this passed the House with such a substantial margin, and the fact that there are 33 Republicans from the House who voted for it really are your answers,\" she said. \"This is not a Republican or Democratic bill. This is a survivor bill.\""

Biden has not yet offered public comment during Wednesday's public hearing, part of an impeachment inquiry stemming from President Trump's July phone conversation with the president of Ukraine, Voldymyr Zelenskiy, who he may have urged to launch an investigation into Joe Biden and his son, Hunter Biden.\n\nThe site also includes television ads that have been released by the campaign.\n\n\"There's a lot of misinformation and lies out there, so welcome to the one stop shop for the facts about Joe Biden.

These hearings are about what kind of commander in chief we should have,\" the e-mail continued..\n\nBiden and his son were the subject of several lines of questioning throughout the testimony, but the former vice president has not given any reaction to the testimony, ignoring shouted questions on the topic from reporters Wednesday morning in DC.\n\nDemocrats are hoping to make their case to millions of Americans watching on television that Trump's conduct has been so serious he deserves to be removed from office.\n\nABC News' John Verhovek contributed to this report."

        "text": "For only the fourth time in U.S. history, the House of Representatives has started a presidential impeachment inquiry. House committees are trying to determine whether President Donald Trump violated his oath of office by asking Ukraine to investigate political rival Joe Biden and his family and to investigate Ukraine's involvement in the 2016 U.S. presidential election.\n\nA quick summary of the latest news and what's to come:\n\nWHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW\n\nDemocrats and Republicans are already tussling over which witnesses to call for the public impeachment hearings in the coming week.\n\nOn Saturday, Republicans released a list of people they want to hear from. Among them: Biden's son, Hunter; one of his former associates at a Ukrainian energy company; and the anonymous whistleblower.\n\nBut Republicans need the committee's approval to summon their witnesses and Democrats are in the majority. The committee chairman, California Rep. Adam Schiff, quickly cast doubt on whether Republicans will get their way.\n\nWithout getting into specifics, Schiff said he won't let the hearings serve as a vehicle to conduct \"sham investigations\" into the Bidens or the 2016 election. Nor will he let the hearings aid Trump's \"effort to threaten, intimate and retaliate against the whistleblower.\"\n\n\u2014Altogether, Republicans want to hear public testimony from eight people they identified, some of whom have already testified privately. They also want to hear from anonymous officials who helped the whistleblower prepare his or her complaint.\n\nThe top Republican on the committee, California Rep. Devin Nunes, said Democrats are conducting a one-sided inquiry and it's important to hear from certain people familiar with Ukrainian corruption and political machinations.\n\n___\n\nTrump says he will release an account of another phone call with Ukraine's leader. His conversation with Volodymyr Zelenskiy in July sparked the impeachment inquiry against him when he was heard pressing the new president for a political favor.\n\nThe two also spoke in April, soon after Zelenskiy won election. Trump said Saturday he has no problem making details of that call public. He says he'll probably do it Tuesday.\n\n___\n\n\u2014Investigators in the inquiry on Friday released hundreds of pages of testimony from Fiona Hill, a former White House Russia adviser, and Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman, an Army officer assigned to the National Security Council. Both testified they were concerned Trump was inappropriately pressuring Ukraine to investigate Democrats.\n\n\u2014 Ivanka Trump told The Associated Press Friday that the identity of whistleblower is \"not particularly relevant\" and \"shouldn't be a substantive part of the conversation.\" The whistleblower sparked the inquiry into Trump's efforts to press Ukraine to investigate the Bidens.\n\n\u2014John Bolton, Trump's former national security adviser, was aware of \"many relevant meetings and conversations\" related to the Ukraine pressure campaign that House impeachment investigators have not yet learned about, his attorney Charles Cooper wrote in a letter to the House general counsel. Cooper wants a federal judge to determine whether Bolton and his former deputy, Charles Kupperman, can be compelled to testify against the White House wishes.\n\n\u2014Acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney and Office of Management and Budget associate director Marky Sandy defied House investigator subpoenas and were no-shows for their scheduled depositions. Mulvaney has asked to join a lawsuit brought by another of the president's advisers challenging a congressional subpoena. That suit, filed by former deputy national security adviser Charles Kupperman, asks a court to decide which of two directives Kupperman must follow \u2014 one from Congress ordering him to testify, the other from the White House telling him not to. A lawyer for Mulvaney says his case presents the same legal issues as Kupperman's and that he is a closer and even more senior adviser to the president than Kupperman was."

The rules of impeachment are very clear, we'll have to have a trial. My own view is that we should give people the opportunity to put the case on,\" McConnell told reporters.\n\n{mosads}He added about the potential time frame for an impeachment trial, \"on the issue of how long it goes on, it's really kind of up to the Senate. People will have to conclude are they learning something new?

Rand Paul (R-Ky.), a close ally of Trump's, also told reporters recently that he wanted to be able to quickly to dismiss any articles of impeachment. \n\nBut members of leadership, as well as rank-and-file senators, have said they expect to go through a trial. \n\nDemocrats tried, but failed, to dismiss the articles of impeachment against then-President Clinton. \n\nA motion to dismiss would need a simple majority of 51 votes.  \n\nSen. John Cornyn (R-Texas) told reporters on Wednesday that he did not expect there would be enough support to quickly dismiss any articles of impeachment and avoid a trial. \n\n\"There's some people talking about trying to stop the bill, dismiss charges basically as soon as they get over here.

        "text": "A White House that has repeatedly struggled to get in sync is sending messages of disharmony days before the first televised public impeachment hearings, which are expected to highlight the divide in the administration over President Trump's efforts in Ukraine.\n\nThe scattershot White House messaging and strategy is nothing new in and of itself. GOP lawmakers and some outside allies have repeatedly criticized the administration for failing to get on the same page.\n\nBut things don't appear to be improving in the hours before House committees prepare to receive public testimony from officials who are expected to offer damaging accounts of efforts by the president's personal attorney Rudy Giuliani to press for investigations by Ukraine. The hearings are likely to receive wall-to-wall coverage on cable news.\n\n{mosads}Trump's use of his own megaphone to drive the message against impeachment has at times undermined arguments coming from his White House and Republican allies on Capitol Hill.\n\nAnd in a confusing move, Trump's acting chief of staff, Mick Mulvaney, on Friday tried to join a lawsuit that names Trump \u2014 his boss \u2014 as one of the defendants. The lawsuit, filed by former National Security Council official Charles Kupperman, sought a court order on whether he must comply with a congressional subpoena. \n\nKupperman opposed Mulvaney's effort in a filing Monday. Mulvaney has since withdrawn from the effort, telling the court he intends to file his own case. \n\nThe move came absent explanation from the White House and marked a different approach from other executive branch officials who have defied subpoenas without seeking a court's judgment. Mulvaney, viewed as a central figure in the administration's decisions with respect to Ukraine, evaded a subpoena for testimony last week.\n\nJack Sharman, a white-collar criminal defense attorney and former special counsel to Congress during the Whitewater investigation, said Mulvaney seemed to be acting as \"an individual\" and doubted it came as part of a broader, concerted strategy by the White House.\n\n\"The more advisable course would be presumably for the White House counsel's office and maybe the Office of Legal Counsel at DOJ to weigh in more for institutional reasons rather than having individual staff members, however senior, seek guidance on their own accord,\" he said.\n\nThe impeachment process itself has laid bare the fractures within the White House, something public testimony this week is likely to further underscore.\n\nNewly released testimony has shown how then-national security adviser John Bolton was deeply critical of Mulvaney's involvement in the Trump administration's foreign policy machinations toward Ukraine. Bolton described Mulvaney as participating in a \"drug deal\" with U.S. Ambassador to the European Union Gordon Sondland.\n\nFiona Hill, a former Russia expert for Trump's National Security Council, described butting heads with Sondland when he asserted authority over Ukraine matters.\n\nAnd officials who testified in recent weeks overwhelmingly expressed unease with the involvement of Giuliani in the administration's dealings with Ukraine.\n\nRevelations about those fights shared space with stories about a new book from former U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley that says she refused to take part in efforts by former chief of staff John Kelly and former Secretary of State Rex Tillerson to go around Trump.\n\nWhile the Haley allegations said little about the specific impeachment charges confronting Trump, they highlighted how officials within the administration have often been at odds with one another and that some officials working with Trump were uncomfortable with his decisions or policies.\n\nIn preparation for the public phase of impeachment, the White House has brought on former Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi (R) and former Treasury Department spokesman Tony Sayegh to lead communications efforts on impeachment, but Trump's own comments over the last week call into question how much that will matter.\n\nOne former White House official who spoke on the condition of anonymity argued the messaging out of the White House has improved in recent days and that there hasn't been a major error since Mulvaney's October press conference during which he undermined a key talking point by acknowledging a quid pro quo in the administration's interactions with Ukraine.\n\n\"It does seem like they've kind of gotten a little sharper with their messaging and a little more aggressive in the last week or so,\" the former official said. \"Realistically speaking, it's going to be a scattered approach.\"\n\nRepublicans have complained for weeks about the lack of cohesion in the White House messaging apparatus. Trump's own difficult-to-predict statements have only highlighted those concerns.\n\nOn Friday, Trump declared there should not be public hearings because he believes the impeachment inquiry is a \"hoax.\" The comment cut against a concerted effort among Republicans on Capitol Hill and advisers at the White House to criticize the lack of transparency in the process thus far.\n\nTrump on Saturday suggested Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) be called to testify in the impeachment inquiry, an unrealistic request that may have detracted from the actual Republican witness list.\n\nThe president on Monday accused House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff (D-Calif.) of releasing \"doctored\" transcripts, a baseless claim that no Republican has backed up.\n\nWhite House press secretary Stephanie Grisham on Monday said the White House and House Republicans who will be able to question witnesses are \"on the same page,\" but did not offer specifics on how or whether they had coordinated.\n\nStill, some allies point to Trump's ability to evade significant political consequences during former special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation as proof that there may be a method to the president's mercurial tendencies.\n\n\"When you look at his ability to push back on the Russia narrative \u2026 I don't want to say he was a one-man operation, but he almost single-handedly did that with a small handful of capable surrogates,\" said one source with direct knowledge of the president's thinking. \"That being said, this is a little different.\"\n\nThe White House or the campaign is expected to begin circulating talking points to television surrogates as hearings get underway, according to a person familiar with the plans.\n\nCurrent and former officials also pointed to the addition of Rep. Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) to the House Intelligence Committee as a potentially significant development for the president's defense. Jordan is one of Trump's fiercest defenders and will now be able to question witnesses during public hearings.\n\nSome outside allies of the president have also sought to step in to help. Former chief strategist Stephen Bannon launched a podcast to take matters into his own hands to bolster the defense of the president, and Giuliani is reportedly considering doing the same.\n\nCurrent and former Trump advisers have highlighted those outside efforts as evidence there is plenty of support to go around as the president faces down the most consequential fight of his time in office.\n\n\"I think whether it's Steve or anyone else, I think the more soldiers the president has fighting on his behalf, the better it is for the president,\" said the former White House official. \"It's all hands on deck.\""

And on Sunday, more than 3,000 delegates representing nearly 9 million registered Democrats across California, will discuss, debate and vote on those candidates and platform.\n\nPresidential forum, minus two big names\nThe big event of the weekend is Saturday's televised Presidential Forum, put on by the state party and Spanish-language news channel Univision.\n\nNetwork anchor Jorge Ramos will host along with Ilia Calderon and Leon Krauze from Univision's flagship local station, KMEX. Rather than lead a round-robin style debate, the journalists will take turns asking the candidates questions individually.\n\nThe state party and Univision picked eight candidates for the forum using a formula based on polling and grassroots support. Invitations went out to Joe Biden, Pete Buttigieg, Juli\u00e1n Castro, Kamala Harris, Beto O'Rourke, Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren and Andrew Yang.\n\nBut two of those candidates, Biden and Warren, declined. That sparked backlash from state party chair Rusty Hicks, who wrote in a series of tweets that Biden and Warren should reconsider their \"misguided decision to publicly snub California's Democrats & Latino Voters across the nation,\" stating that they \"just might\" need California activists' support in the general election. Sen. Amy Klobuchar and San Francisco megadonor Tom Steyer took the place of Biden and Warren on the stage.\n\nO'Rourke has also since dropped out of the presidential race, with Sen. Cory Booker sliding into that spot.\n\nOther Democratic presidential candidates who didn't make the cut for evening forum on Saturday have been invited to speak during the general session that morning. Marianne Williamson, John Delaney and Joe Sestak are expected to take the stage at that event, along with prominent Democrats such as Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Burbank, and labor leaders such as California Teachers Association President E. Toby Boyd.\n\nTickets are sold out\nWhile delegates can still register to attend the convention, \"observer passes\" for the general public to watch the general session and presidential forum are sold out.\n\nThe forum will air live from 4 to 6 p.m. on Univision's TV, radio and online platforms.\n\nThe Southern California News Group will also be sharing coverage of the general session, presidential forum and Sunday's endorsements on PressTelegram.com and our other websites.\n\nEvents also planned around convention\nMany of the candidates and groups participating in the convention will take advantage of the opportunity to also host events in Southern California this weekend.\n\nIn various rooms around the convention center Saturday night, Jewish Democratic groups will serve up frozen treats, tribal leaders will offer desserts and wine, and the California Nurses Association will have a DJ, beef sliders and a photo booth.\n\nHarris will host events Friday night at nearby Portuguese Bend Distilling and Hamburger Mary's.\n\nSanders is also holding a free public rally at noon Saturday in Salazar Park.

        "text": "At an election board meeting Wednesday that at times became tense, Lebanon County GOP chairman Casey Long demanded the county conduct a recount for the Lebanon City Council race that is currently separated by three votes. \n\nVotes that could not be counted at the precinct level on election night - including provisional, military, and absentee ballots that wouldn't scan - were added to the tally after the election board met Friday to review the ballots and hand count them.\n\nThe new tally has Democrat candidate Amy Keller ahead of Republican Andrew Zidik by three votes, according to the latest official results. On election night, Zidik was ahead by 10 votes, according to the unofficial results, which would have won him the third seat on the council. \n\nRepublicans Chris Miller and Richard Wertz won the first and second seats in the six-candidate race. \n\nElection coverage:Election 2019: Lebanon County results for commissioner, municipalities, schools\n\nLong requested a recount at the meeting, stating that the 13-vote difference in the council race between election night's unofficial results and the most recent count is cause for scrutiny.\n\nThe election board declined to vote on Long's recount request, and similarly declined to vote on a request he made to review the 118 ballots with Zidik and the election board. \n\n\"I don\u8ab8 know that anyone has brought to me, or that I have viewed any kind of discrepancy in the returns,\" election board member Stephanie Axarlis said. \"If someone petitions and the court orders it, a recount makes sense. But without that I am not inclined to conduct a recount on our own.\"\n\nLong told The Lebanon Daily News that he thinks a recount would show Zidik as the winner. \n\"I'd love to know what's going on there,\" Long said of the 118 ballots in question. \"But they refuse us the right to view the ballots, because they're trying to hide something.\"\nWhen asked what he based that comment on, Long said that their decision to not allow him to view the ballots puts the whole process into doubt. He said they intend to file a court petition for a recount. \n\nLebanon County has no rules regarding when to call for an automatic recount.\nZidik said he didn't necessarily think any election officials were trying to hide anything, but said the narrow margin and the use of the new, paper-based voting machines are reasons enough to hold a recount.\n\n\"We\u8ab6e talking three votes,\" he said. \"To go from up 10 to down 3, I think I deserve (a recount) as a candidate and I think the voters deserve it.\"\n\nKeller said she discussed the possibility of requesting a recount on election night, when the unofficial count had her down 10 votes, but was not set on it at the time and was concerned over how much it would cost. \n\nShe called into question the intentions behind Long and Zidik's requests for a recount. \n\n\"It's not about the integrity of the election,\" she said, indicating that if the results were flipped, she doubted the Republicans would have requested a recount. \n\n\"I think we need to trust our electoral process, and I think we need to trust our appointed board of electors to do the job they were appointed to do,\" Keller said. \n\nDemocratic Party chairman Dan Sidelnick said he attended the election board meeting last week when they reviewed the 118 ballots, and saw no issues with the process.  \n\nBut, he said this is a good reminder that \"every vote counts.\"\n\nWhat's the issue?\nLebanon County Director of Elections Michael Anderson said Wednesday that 118 ballots were not counted on election night. Some were provisional or military ballots, while others were absentee ballots that were not accepted by a precinct's ballot scanner on election night. \n\nAnderson said a ballot might not be accepted by the scanner for a variety of reasons, including whether it had any stains or rips on it.\n\nAfter Long contended that state law requires absentee ballots to be counted on election night at the precinct level, Anderson noted that the process to count all absentee ballots was attempted at every precinct. \n\nThe un-scanned absentee ballots were sent to be counted by the election board because precinct-level officials shouldn't have that big of a responsibility, Anderson said. \n\n\"I believe it was this county board's authority to determine how a vote should be counted if it did not scan correctly or if it came up with any kind of message,\" Anderson said. \"You don\u8ab8 want to have a local board making decisions on voter intent.\"\n\nThere are no more ballots that need to be counted, Anderson said. If a recount is not filed, the results would be finalized Nov. 19. \n\nA petition to request a recount would have to be filed by Nov. 18. \n"

        "text": "The prison counselor had finished her group session a few minutes earlier, and now it was time for Indian Creek Correctional Center inmate Lonnie Crowder to step up.\n\nThe six dozen men of Building 4, side B, incarcerated in what state officials believe is the largest treatment-oriented prison in the nation, lined up chairs as Crowder set up an easel on one of the unit's game tables, and wrote down \"Success and Achievement.\"\n\nThere are 1,000 offenders at Indian Creek, all of whom are in the so-called \"Therapeutic Community\" treatment program.\n\nMost were sent there against their will when they had about two years left to serve. But many end up buying into into the prison's highly structured, intensive program aimed at changing minds and changing behavior.\n\nCrowder's one of the ones who has bought in. Prison officials named him an elder, a leadership and mentoring role prison officials gave him as he nears the end of two decades behind bars.\n\nIt helped that Antonio Davis, an offender he'd crossed paths with at another prison, was there to meet him months ago when Crowder stepped into Indian Creek's orientation building. Like many when they first arrive, Crowder was unhappy to be at the Chesapeake prison and not open to the idea that it could set him on a new path.\n\nDavis became one of his \"brother's keepers.\"\n\nBrother's keepers\n\nIt's an idea that lies at the heart of Indian Creek's decade-old program, along with a day that begins at 5:30 am and ends at 11 at night, when lights out means lights out and none of that watching TV in your cell as late as you like that is possible at most other prisons.\n\nThe brother's keeper idea isn't just having someone you can talk to. It's not a warm and fuzzy kind of thing. That's not the way prison goes, and Indian Creek is definitely a prison.\n\nAlong with the brother's keeper idea is what Crowder's fellow elder George Martin calls \"about 100 rules.\" When you break one, it is as likely as not that a fellow offender, acting as your brother's keeper, will write you up.\n\nElder offenders, Lonnie Crowder, Jr., left, and Calvin Jennings lead a group discussion about Success, part of Indian Creek Prison's therapeutic community program Thursday, October 24, 2019.\nElder offenders, Lonnie Crowder, Jr., left, and Calvin Jennings lead a group discussion about Success, part of Indian Creek Prison's therapeutic community program Thursday, October 24, 2019.\nIn fact, there's an expectation you will write up others, since how often you do so is one of the measures Indian Creek staff use to see how you're advancing with the program.\n\n\"You're written up, you have to face it, have to apologize, maybe. \u2026 on the street, it's the law. Rules there are misdemeanors, felonies. You break those rules, it's the police,\" Martin says.\n\nWhat happens after a write-up is a gathering of chairs in the common area that's at the front of each barn-like housing unit at Indian Creek.\n\nThere's one small circle, perhaps of those who witnessed the rule-breaking, and usually also including peers who feel they've got something useful to say. The rest of the unit gathers round in a larger circle to watch.\n\nSometimes, it gets a bit confrontational. Sometimes there's an explanation. There's usually some back and forth. There's often an apology, and a promise to try to do better.\n\n\"Your brother's keeper keeps challenging you, holds you accountable,\" said Davis, who does it for Crowder. \"On the street you see something, you keep it to yourself. You hear something, you keep it to yourself. This isn't being the police, it is having expectations, being accountable, being responsible for what you do.. I'm not trying to be police. But on the street, can't nobody hear \u2018Hey, can I talk to you for a minute?' It's \u2018Put your hands behind your back.'\"\n\nThe accountability goes both ways. Crowder is one of Davis's brother's keepers, too.\n\nBecause the main thing Indian Creek's program is about is getting offenders to think about others, about their impact on other people and how to deal with other people's impact on them.\n\nNew arrivals\n\nIt isn't easy, writing another offender up for the first few times \u2014 if, in fact, it ever is.\n\nBut it starts, just as the brother's keeper idea does, fairly soon after an offender is sent to Indian Creek, in the orientation units in Building 1.\n\nThey feel much more like other Virginia prisons. There's a tense undertone, lots of milling around, unfriendly stares.\n\nIt's far from as calm and quiet and well-scrubbed as Building 4, which on a recent autumn weekday sported the blue flag with gold stars that signaled it had, once again, beaten other units for staying clean and sticking with the program.\n\nThe payoff for the cooperative effort that goes into winning the flag is being first in line for meals. It may not seem like much, but Indian Creek is, after all, a prison. And the small incentives prisons give \u2014 a bit of extra recreation time, permission to keep TVs on after lights out if there's a big football or basketball game \u2014 make a difference, Warden Rick White explains.\n\nThomas Kufeld could be in Building 4 or one of the other units on the so-called \"re-entry\" side of Indian Creek. But once named an elder, he volunteered to go back to Building 1.\n\nHe felt he had something to tell the new arrivals about isolation. And about it means to live in a community.\n\n\"I thought I had figured it out,\" Kufeld said. \"I was at Greensville. I was a teacher's aide, I was doing good. But I'd spend all day working, doing my job, come back, take a shower and shut the cell door behind me. I wanted to shut it out.\"\n\nKeeping your distance is how to make through most prisons.\n\n\"At Greensville, you don't open up, because you suppress a lot of feelings. If you don't, you're vulnerable,\" Kufeld said.\n\nThat attitude stops in Indian Creek's orientation building, though it can take time.\n\n\"You can see it, guy sitting there, arms like this,\" Kufeld said, crossing his arms in an angry, defensive gesture across his chest. \"Stone cold killer, he's not going to say anything.\"\n\nOpening up\n\nBut the new arrival's got to participate. One of the rules at Indian Creek is no lying in bed, the way you can in other prisons. You're assigned to a team, maybe the one that cleans the unit, maybe the one that organizes the several meetings and groups that fill days blocked off into 90-minute periods, rather like a school. There's no dodging assignments, and no dodging groups.\n\nWhen a counselor comes for what the prison calls a process group, and a dozen or so offenders have to arrange chairs in a circle and start answering questions and talking to one another, even the most guarded newcomer sees it is possible to talk without fear.\n\nYou'll hear stories about drug use. About crimes never punished. About disappointed families. About guilt. About shame.\n\nAnd you start telling them.\n\nThere'll be those double circles \u2014 called awareness groups \u2014 convened to deal with a write-up. You'll likely be star of the show in some; you'll often end up as one of the peers in the inner circle who thinks he has something to say that can help.\n\nThere's nothing else like it anywhere in the Department of Corrections' 30,000-inmate system, except for a smaller program at the women's prison in Goochland County.\n\n\"I tell people, it's a way to shake the DoC off of you,\" Kufeld said.\n\nStructure\n\nElder offender Laquinne Brownlee greets fellow offenders prior to a larger group discussion about Success, part of Indian Creek Prison's therapeutic community program Thursday, October 24, 2019.\nElder offender Laquinne Brownlee greets fellow offenders prior to a larger group discussion about Success, part of Indian Creek Prison's therapeutic community program Thursday, October 24, 2019.\n\"Out there, if you don't feel like getting out of bed, you can sleep til noon,\" said elder Laquinne Brownlee, talking about life on the outside.\n\nYou can do the same at other prisons \u2014 even some of the hard-time ones, like Nottaway, where Brownle's done time. Officers don't have to worry about escapes or assaults if an inmate's staying in bed.\n\nThe rules \u2014 the real rules \u2014 at a place like Nottoway or Greensville aren't anything like Indian Creek's either.\n\n\"You're in there with lifers, people who ain't ever getting out, the rules are different,\" Brownlee said.\n\nThose rules: Make sure you don't irritate anyone; make sure you aren't disrespected.\n\nBut when you're responsible for yourself, and for others, there's a chance to learn a new way of life, Brownlee said.\n\n\"I found a purpose here,\" he said. \"I found I have a voice. There's power in my voice. I talk a lot, I know.\"\n\nHe's hoping to find a place in church, as a deacon or preacher when he gets out.\n\nHe's learned this, too:\n\n\"Coming here, you find out everybody's a star in their own way.\"\n\nHelping yourself by helping out\n\nMartin, like Kufeld, has volunteered to go back to Building 1 when he didn't have to.\n\nHe's serving his fourth sentence, and was in line for a plum outside job at another prison when the Department of Corrections assessment identified him as a candidate for Indian Creek.\n\nA big part of the assessment is the offender's general attitude \u2014 and the aim is to target hard cases with a history of substance abuse. The program isn't meant for everyone, but targets those at the highest risk of re-offending. Although overall figures aren't tracked, the recidivism rate for sub-set of offenders, about a quarter of Indian Creek's population, who are sent there directly by a judge's order is 26%. That's not quite half the national rate.\n\nMartin had met Lachelle Naar, Indian Creek's chief of housing and programs, years before at another prison in the DoC system.\n\n\"Miss Naar made it perfectly clear that this was mandatory,\" Martin recalled. \"I said to myself, \u2018I'm going to complete this program.'\"\n\nLike Crowder, he credits Antonio Davis in his role as a brother's keeper with helping out, soon after his arrival in Building 1.\n\n\"Mr. Davis told me to slow down, telling me it was all going bad if I couldn't,\" Martin said. (One of the rules at Indian Creek is every man, offenders included, is a Mr. and every female officer a Ms.)\n\nSlow down he did.\n\nThat's another big part of the Indian Creek program \u2014 reflecting on where you've been and where you're going, and both take time.\n\nAs Martin reflected, and finished the three phases of the program, ready to head over to the re-entry side of the prison and prepare for discharge, it came to him that he wanted to help new arrivals. Normally, offenders spend about a year on the re-entry, still going through the program of groups and work, and being one another's brother's keepers.\n\n\"I'm here for selling (drugs). The poison I sold \u2014 I talk to people in here who use, and I ask where did I go wrong? I'm 47, I'm looking at these younger guys, I want to try to get them to stop,\" Martin said.\n\n\"I got to be straight with myself.\"\n\nBeing honest\n\nAs the men Building 4 unit gather for Crowder's group, one, who is due to be released in a couple of days, hands over a final assessment form to another of Indian Creek's elders.\n\nIt includes a long list of questions, asking if an offender agrees or disagrees with various notions the program stresses. This offender has mostly ticked off the circles for \"neither agree nor disagree\" or \"disagree somewhat.\"\n\nIt's a form that men in the program will fill out more than once during their stay at Indian Creek and is meant to help staff figure out how well their efforts, and those of the brother's keepers and groups, are working.\n\nThe final form will help determine terms of probation for an Indian Creek offender \u2014 the prison's term for all of them, by the way, is \"returning citizen.\" The obvious answer to the questions, like the first one about trusting the counselors, is \"strongly agree.\"\n\nBut one of the big things Indian Creek's program stresses is being honest, even when it may not seem to your benefit, the elder said.\n\nDoes that inmate's honesty mean he'll make it on the outside?\n\nThe elder shrugs. Not everyone gets all the lessons the program tries to teach, but he figures at least three quarters will set out on a new path that won't lead them back to prison.\n\nMatthew Smith, who had turned in his form a few days earlier and was set to leave the next day, is feeling good about his prospects.\n\nHe's got a job lined up with his brother's construction and pest firm, Hilton Home and Wildlife Services, in King George County.\n\nAt Indian Creek, he's learned to confront himself, and what made him drink and mess around with drugs.\n\nAnd he's learned to be proud of being able to change.\n\n\"I've become a leader. I can take a knee, and be a leader from the back, as well as in the front,\" he said. \"Yes, I'm ready.\"\n\nSuccess and achievement\n\nCrowder, meanwhile, is asking the men to call out names of successful people.\n\n\"Mr. Obama,\" said one. \"Oprah\" from another. \"Bill Gates.\"\n\nAnd:\n\n\"Mrs. Scales,\" said Patrick Scales.\n\nThis prompts a question from Crowder:\n\n\"Do you have to be rich or wealthy to be successful? Do you have to have a Super Bowl ring or a championship trophy?\"\n\nNo, said Scales. Mrs. Scales is his mother, and she's successful because she sets goals for herself and then meets them. Then she sets new goals, works to meet them.\n\n\"Success isn't something you've done. You keep doing it,\" Scales said.\n\n\"Let's give some love,\" Crowder says, and the men start clapping.\n\nScales, too, had volunteered to go back to Building 1 after completing all the phases of the therapeutic community program. For him, it was among other things, a way to feel how well the program took.\n\n\"You learn to see that a convict can be good,\" he said. He learned to see that about himself, and about the others in the community they formed at Indian Creek.\n\n\"You need to see Patrick Scales, not Pretty Pat \u2014 that's what they called me on the street. I've been learning to recognize myself, who I am, not that Pretty Pat on the street,\" he said.\n\nThen: \"You know, I've never said this. Miss Naar doesn't know this. My great-grandfather was Bojangles Robinson \u2014 you know, the dancer,\" he said.\n\nHis father, his brother, the rest of his family have made successes of their lives, he continued.\n\nNaar, sitting nearby, glanced over at him, surprised.\n\n\"I ended up on the street,\" he said.\n\nBut now:\n\n\"I want to do better.\""

Rand Paul said Thursday he may try to force a Senate vote on motions that would allow President Donald Trump to call on Hunter Biden and other witnesses to testify in an impeachment trial.\n\nKentucky's junior Republican senator has staunchly defended the president since the House began its impeachment inquiry into Trump's dealings with Ukraine. \n\nThe impeachment inquiry, which featured its second public hearing Friday, revolves around whether Trump improperly pressured President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine to investigate Joe Biden and his son, Hunter, in exchange for U.S. military aid.\n\nTrump and his allies, including Paul, have complained that the president deserves the 6th Amendment right to confront the whistleblower who revealed details of Trump's July phone call with Zelensky.\n\nPaul and some GOP colleagues want their chamber to call on the alleged whistleblower and amend their impeachment resolution to call on Hunter Biden to testify if an impeachment trial occurs in the Senate.\n\n\"I believe very strongly the president should be able to call his own witnesses,\" Paul told reporters on Thursday, according to Politico. \"The rules that are put forward will be amendable, so yes I will consider strongly that the president should get his full due process, which to me means bringing in his own witnesses.\"\n\nLast week, Paul blocked a Democrat-led resolution that reasserted the Senate's support for protecting whistleblowers.\n\nAnd after calling for the media to release the alleged whistleblower's name, Paul went ahead and said the name of the suspected anonymous whistleblower during a radio interview Wednesday.\n\nSeveral conservative websites have claimed they know the whistleblower's identity and have included that person's name in stories.\n\nHowever, the whistleblower's identity has not been publicly verified or revealed, which is why USA TODAY and The Courier Journal are not publishing the person's name.\n\nFederal laws protect whistleblowers from retaliation, which could include identifying the person in question.\n\nDespite receiving some blowback for saying a name of an alleged tipster, Paul will likely face little to no punishment, according to experts on whistleblower protection law.\n\n\"There's no specific law that makes it a crime to reveal the name of a whistleblower, except if you're the Inspector General to whom the whistleblower made the complaint,\" said Robert Litt, who served as general counsel to the Office of the Director of National Intelligence under President Barack Obama.\n\nHunter Biden served on the board of Ukrainian gas firm Burisma at the same time his father was serving as the Obama administration's point man for Ukraine.\n\nWhile Ukraine's top prosecutor had previously investigated Burisma for potential corruption, neither Joe nor Hunter Biden has been accused of any wrongdoing by Ukrainian authorities.\n\nPaul said during Trump's rally last week in Lexington that the alleged whistleblower \"worked for Joe Biden at the same time Hunter Biden was getting money from corrupt oligarchs.\"\n\nSpokespeople for Paul have not immediately returned The Courier Journal's request for comment on his plan to possibly force Hunter Biden and the alleged whistleblower to testify.\n\nWhen asked Thursday for a comment on Paul's decision to name the alleged whistleblower, Paul's communications team referred The Courier Journal to another interview the senator did Wednesday with One America News Network.\n\nIn that interview, Paul said the alleged whistleblower's name once again but claimed that he hasn't specifically said that the person is, in fact, the whistleblower.\n\nRegardless, he said he thinks this individual should be brought in as a \"material witness.\""

Taylor testified that the military aid was frozen for the explicit purpose of compelling Ukraine to begin the probes, contradicting Trump's claim that there was never a \"quid pro quo.\"   \n\nImpeachment inquiry:Who are the 15 witnesses in the Trump impeachment inquiry and what have they said?\n\nRepublicans lawmakers on the committee will  try to cast doubt on the testimony from the trio of diplomats \u2013 and on the impeachment inquiry in general. They are likely to try to change the focus by insisting that Trump had a legitimate concern about alleged corruption involving Biden and his son Hunter. \n\nHere are the committee members to watch: \n\nAdam Schiff \nIntelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, D-Calif., was a leading Trump critic during the investigations into Russian election meddling, predicting after the midterm elections that Trump could \"be the first president in quite some time to face the real prospect of jail time\" when he leaves office. He said in a USA TODAY op-ed that the president appeared to be \"compromised\" by Russia.\n\nIn the Ukraine case, Schiff said Trump is guilty of \"abusing his power to the detriment of our national security and doing so to get yet another foreign country to intervene in our election.\"\n\nRepublicans called on Schiff to step down after the investigation by special counsel Robert Mueller did not lead to official charges against the Trump campaign. They have repeated calls for him to resign amid the impeachment inquiry, implying that he manipulated witnesses. Trump alleged he doctored the transcripts in the case, despite the fact that Republicans were present for the testimony. \n\nDevin Nunes \nRep. Devin Nunes, R-Calif., is the ranking Republican on the House Intelligence Committee and preceded Schiff as chairman, a role he used to defend Trump during the Russia probe. Nunes temporarily stepped aside from his leadership role during the probe amid an ethics complaint that said he briefed White House officials on classified material in the case without first sharing it with the committee. \n\nNunes called the impeachment inquiry a one-sided political \"sham.\" Saturday, he submitted a list of proposed Republican witnesses that included Hunter Biden and witnesses he said could support Trump and Giuliani's theory that Ukraine, not Russia, was the true culprit behind meddling in the 2016 U.S. election.\n\nNunes asked for the anonymous whistleblower whose complaint helped spark the inquiry to publicly testify so Trump can \"confront his accusers\" and Republicans could find out who \"may have fed the information\" to him or her. \n\nJim Jordan \nRep. Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, the ranking Republican on the House Oversight Committee, moved to the Intelligence Committee this month to help lead the defense of the president during the public hearings. House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., said Jordan's addition would \"ensure more accountability and transparency in this sham process.\" \n\nDuring the initial hearings in the inquiry, Jordan repeatedly used his opening statements to condemn what he called the Democrats' unfair process in the impeachment probe. \n\nLike Nunes, Jordan said the whistleblower should be compelled to testify, writing in a USA TODAY op-ed that \"Americans should assess for themselves the credibility and motivations of the individual who initiated the inquiry.\" \n\nEric Swalwell \nRep. Eric Swalwell, D-Calif., had been a zealous advocate for Trump's impeachment even before the Ukraine allegations became public, joining other Democrats who said the potential acts of obstruction of justice outlined by Mueller warranted the president's removal. \n\nSwalwell, who was briefly among the large field of Democratic presidential primary candidates, is a former prosecutor who will be eager to put the Trump administration on trial. \n\nWill Hurd \nRep. Will Hurd, R-Texas, is a moderate Republican who has bucked the president, calling Trump's depiction of a crisis on the U.S.-Mexican border a \"myth.\" Hurd, the lone African American Republican in the House, called Trump's tweet telling four minority congresswomen to \"go back\" to their countries of origin \"racist and xenophobic.\" \n\nHurd has been highly critical of Democrats' handling of the impeachment process and backed calls for Hunter Biden to testify. The former CIA officer does not support the push to force the whistleblower to be unmasked. \n\nHurd will be a lawmaker to watch for any signs that Republicans from swing districts could break ranks and turn on Trump.\n\nDuring an interview this week on \"Fox News Sunday,\" Hurd said he believed Trump was trying to crack down on corruption in Ukraine, but \"trying to get information on a political rival to use in a political campaign is not something a president or any official should be doing\" and \"would be a violation of the law.\"\n\nJohn Ratcliffe\nThis summer, Trump pushed for Rep. John Ratcliffe, R-Texas, to become his director of national intelligence, but even Republicans said he was too partisan for the role. \n\nRatcliffe gained national attention for his aggressive questioning of Mueller.\n\n\"Donald Trump is not above the law. He's not. But he damn sure shouldn't be below the law,\" he said, scolding the former special counsel. \n\nHere are the other members of the committee: \n\nDemocrats   \n\nRep. Jim Himes, 4th District of Connecticut\nRep. Terri Sewell, 7th District of Alabama\nRep. Andre Carson, 7th District of Indiana\nRep. Jackie Speier, 14th District of California\nRep.

        "title": "What Roger Stone's trial revealed about Donald Trump and WikiLeaks",
        "text": "The Roger Stone trial is no longer just about Roger Stone.\n\nDespite the profane Stone texts and caustic friendships that have dominated chatter about the case, the Republican provocateur's court battle will likely be remembered for something far different: It revealed that Donald Trump's 2016 campaign aides knew more about WikiLeaks' plans than they have let on, and the president may have later misled Robert Mueller about it.\n\nBuried amid days of blasphemy and bombast were quieter new details that collectively showed Trump and his aides discussed WikiLeaks with Stone months earlier than anyone has acknowledged. The revelations have immediately raised questions about Trump's claims \u2014 made months later under oath to the special counsel \u2014 that he did not recall any such conversations with Stone.\n\n\nAccording to direct testimony and dozens of email and text messages introduced over the last week, the Trump campaign got its first heads up about Julian Assange's ability to upend U.S. politics as far back as April 2016. The timing is months earlier than any Trump aide has previously described, and months before WikiLeaks published its first cache of damaging materials that would go on to cripple Hillary Clinton's White House bid.\n\nAdditionally, a wider cast of Trump aides participated in WikiLeaks strategy sessions than previously known as they mapped out an attack plan to take advantage of the hacked Democratic emails. Trump son-in-law Jared Kushner, campaign chairman Paul Manafort, campaign CEO Steve Bannon and senior adviser Stephen Miller were all part of those broader discussions about how to best turn the WikiLeaks surprises into political gold.\n\nPerhaps most politically damning, Trump himself discussed the matter with Stone during a phone call in the heat of the summertime general election campaign, according to testimony from former-Trump campaign deputy Rick Gates, who witnessed the call while riding with the GOP nominee from his namesake tower in Manhattan to LaGuardia Airport. While the testimony might not put Trump in any fresh legal peril, it has highlighted a potential contradiction in Trump's written responses to Mueller's team.\n\n\"I do not recall discussing WikiLeaks with [Stone], nor do I recall being aware of Mr. Stone having discussed WikiLeaks with individuals associated with my campaign,\" Trump wrote.\n\nOf course, Mueller and his Justice Department supervisors had their reasons for holding back on the public release of so much WikiLeaks-related information before the Stone trial, which didn't start until more than six months after the conclusion of the special counsel's Russia probe. Namely, they didn't want to damage the government's case against the longtime GOP operative, meaning any references to their evidence were blacked out in the final Russia report.\n\n\"I do not recall discussing WikiLeaks with [Stone], nor do I recall being aware of Mr. Stone having discussed WikiLeaks with individuals associated with my campaign.\"\n\n--President Donald Trump\n\nBut that was a mistake, said several legal experts. The decision to keep private such information left the public confused and more susceptible to the president's \"no collusion, no obstruction\" spin, they argued.\n\n\"He did miss a chance to get the public behind him as he told the story of what he had uncovered,\" said David Weinstein, a former federal prosecutor from South Florida.\n\nWhile that may be frustrating to a wider audience, the information could still find a home in the congressional impeachment proceedings that are only now advancing to the public hearings stage.\n\n\"Huge,\" Philippe Reines, the former top Clinton 2016 campaign aide, wrote on Twitter after Gates' testimony on Tuesday revealed the extent to which Trump played a role in his campaign's efforts to follow the document dumps. \"First person to confirm trump knew what Wikileaks was planning.\"\n\n\"It's why collusion/obstruction shouldn't be on the back burner,\" Reines added.\n\nMueller's final report \u2014 the byproduct of 18 months of investigation, 500 witness interviews and more than 2,800 subpoenas \u2014 concluded that there was insufficient evidence to file charges involving a criminal conspiracy between the Trump campaign and Russian hackers. It only hinted at the Trump campaign's eagerness to profit off WikiLeaks' disclosures.\n\nFor instance, the report simply recounted Trump campaign officials talking about the WikiLeaks dumps during the summer of 2016. Even then, the report blacked out any specifics of those conversations, citing a warning that revealing those details would cause a \"harm to ongoing matter\" \u2014 presumably the Stone case.\n\nThose details were filled in as a procession of government witnesses helped make the case against Stone.\n\nGates, formerly Manafort's No. 2 on the campaign, testified on Tuesday that he heard from Stone in April 2016 about the potential Assange-orchestrated assistance \u2014 two months before Trump secured the GOP presidential nomination.\n\n\"Mr. Stone indicated that WikiLeaks would be submitting or dropping information but no information on dates or anything of that nature,\" Gates said.\n\nTwo months later, Gates testified that he got a text message from Stone asking for contact information for Kushner, whom he wanted to \"debrief\" about the WikiLeaks hacks. Also that month, Gates said the Trump campaign became elated as it learned more information from Stone about the WikiLeaks founder's plans to publish damaging information about Clinton and her campaign.\n\nBy July, Trump senior aides including Manafort, Gates, Miller and campaign communications adviser Jason Miller were meeting to discuss how they could map out a press strategy allowing them to take advantage of the WikiLeaks dumps.\n\nTrump himself entered the picture that month, too. According to Gates, Stone and Trump spoke by phone about the WikiLeaks document dumps en route to the airport. Gates testified that he couldn't overhear the exact conversation, but Trump signaled aloud what they'd been talking about moments after the call ended.\n\n\"He indicated that more information would be coming out,\" Gates said.\n\nSenior Trump aides were hearing more and more about WikiLeaks as the summer progressed.\n\nOn Aug. 3, Stone sent an email to Manafort about the prospect of more damaging documents released about the Clinton campaign. \"I have an idea \u2026 to save Trump's ass,\" Stone wrote to Manafort, his former '80s-era lobbying partner whom he helped land a job atop the Trump campaign.\n\nLess than two weeks later, Stone reached out to Bannon. \"I do know how to win this but it ain't pretty,\" he wrote Bannon, who had just been announced that day as the campaign's newly hired CEO.\n\nIn his testimony last Friday, Bannon explained that he'd been hearing from Stone about his access to WikiLeaks going back to his time atop the conservative media outlet Breitbart, long before he joined the Trump campaign. Once he was working on the Trump campaign, Bannon said his team saw Stone as its connection to WikiLeaks and Assange even while maintaining they had \"no official access.\"\n\nStone kept on relaying information about WikiLeaks' damaging materials through the late summer and early fall, helping the Trump campaign assess alternate strategies at a time when it was down significantly in public polls.\n\n\"Roger is an agent provocateur,\" Bannon explained. \"He's an expert in opposition research. He's an expert in the tougher side of politics. When you're this far behind, you're going to have to use every tool in the toolbox.\"\n\nWikiLeaks stayed front and center in Stone's communications with other top Trump campaign associates.\n\nOn Oct. 3, Stone discussed the document dumps with Erik Prince, an informal 2016 adviser whom he called in an email a \"great American.\" One day later, Stone and Bannon were exchanging messages about a much-hyped Assange news conference that ultimately revealed little about the activists' plans.\n\n\"What was that this morning?\" Bannon wrote Stone in an email prosecutors had read in court.\n\nStone replied: \"Fear. Serious security concerns. He thinks they are going to kill him and the London police are standing done [sic]. However - a load every week going forward.\"\n\nBannon replied: \"He didn't cut deal w/ clintons???\"\n\nThe Trump campaign's effort to respond to and capitalize on the WikiLeaks disclosures may have swept in more officials than previously realized.\n\nDuring cross-examination of Bannon last week, Stone lawyer Robert Buschel suggested that Bannon had previously identified a diverse set of people \u2014 including Brad Parscale, David Bossie, Michael Flynn, Rudy Giuliani and Donald Trump Jr. \u2014 as having taken credit for the key October WikiLeaks dump . But that claim remained murky, since Bannon said he didn't recall.\n\nIn all, Stone's phone recordsshowed more than 150 calls between Stone and Manafort from February to November 2016. During that same time period, Stone contacted Gates more than 120 times and connected with Trump 60 times, according to the federal prosecutors trying the case against Stone.\n\nTo Mueller watchers, the Stone trial has offered \u2014 belatedly \u2014 the granular picture that the Russia special counsel described only in broad strokes.\n\n\"Mueller's failure to lay out this testimony in the detail in which it is emerging at the Stone trial allowed Trump and [Attorney General William] Barr to distort the narrative by proclaiming \u2018No Collusion,'\" said Philip Allen Lacovara, a former top counsel to two Watergate special prosecutors.\n\nHe added that Mueller could have made a clearer distinction between collusion and the limited reach of existing law that prohibits such conduct but opted to \"wear blinders on the issue in which the country was really interested.\"\n\nBarbara McQuade, a former Obama-era U.S. attorney from Michigan, said Stone's trial reaffirms her view Mueller \"took a very conservative approach in deciding whether a conspiracy existed.\"\n\nAll of the details coming out of the Stone trial has also added to a long-standing mystery around the wider Mueller probe. Why did it close shop back in April when a trial loomed later in the year?\n\n\"If he had waited until these facts became public,\" McQuade said, \"the reaction to the report would have been very different.\""

        "title": "Court's conservatives seem to back Trump on immigration",
        "text": "The Supreme Court's conservative majority seems prepared to allow the Trump administration to end a program that allows some immigrants to work legally in the United States and protects them from deportation.\n\nThere did not appear to be any support among the five conservatives in extended arguments Tuesday for blocking the administration's decision to wind down the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program. It currently protects 660,000 immigrants who came to the United States as children and are here illegally.\n\nChief Justice John Roberts and Justice Brett Kavanaugh were among the justices who indicated that the administration has provided sufficient reason for wanting to do away with the program. Justices Neil Gorsuch and Samuel Alito raised questions about whether courts should even be reviewing the executive branch's discretionary decisions.\n\nThe high court's decision is expected by June, at the height of the 2020 presidential campaign.\n\nThe program was begun under President Barack Obama. The Trump administration announced in September 2017 that it would end DACA protections, but lower federal courts have stepped in to keep the program alive.\n\nPresident Donald Trump tweeted Tuesday that if the Supreme Court overturns the immigrants' protections \"a deal will be made with the Dems for them to stay!\" But Trump's past promises to work with Democrats on a legislative solution for these immigrants have not led to an agreement.\n\nTrump said in his tweet that many program participants are \"far from 'angels,\" and he falsely claimed that \"some are very tough, hardened criminals.\" The program bars anyone with a felony conviction from participating. Serious misdemeanors may also bar eligibility.\n\nThe Heritage Foundation agrees.\n\n\"Amnesty is a terrible policy. It does nothing but get more amnesty and more illegal immigration and should not be on the table,\" said Mike Howell, senior advisor for executive branch relations.\n\nJustice Sonia Sotomayor made the only direct reference to Trump, saying he told DACA recipients \"that they were safe under him and that he'd find a way to keep them here. And he hasn't.\"\n\nShe also complained that the administration's rationale has shifted over time and that it has mainly relied on the view that DACA is illegal, leaving no choice but to end it.\n\nIn her most pointed comment, Sotomayor said the administration has failed to plainly say, \"This is about our choice to destroy lives.\"\n\nSolicitor General Noel Francisco, Trump's top Supreme Court lawyer, did not directly respond to Sotomayor. But near the end of the 80-minute arguments, he asserted that the administration has taken responsibility for its decision and is not relying only on its belief that DACA is illegal. \"We own this,\" Francisco said.\n\nNY Lawmakers Stand In Support Of DACA\n\nRoberts, who could hold the pivotal vote on the court, aimed his few questions at lawyers representing DACA recipients and their supporters. He did not seriously question the administration's argument.\n\nHowever, in June the chief justice surprised many observers when he cast the deciding vote to prevent the administration from adding a citizenship question to the 2020 census, despite not voicing much skepticism during arguments in the case.\n\nMORE: Democrats: Trump Immigration Separation Policy 'Contrary To Our Values'\n\nSome DACA recipients who are part of the lawsuit against Trump's action were in the courtroom for the arguments. Many people camped out in front of the court for days for a chance at some of the few seats available to the general public. Roberts rejected a request to provide live or same-day audio of the arguments. The court will post the audio on its website on Friday.\n\nYouth known as \"Dreamers\" were among those who boarded a bus in Queens headed for the Supreme Court at 5 a.m. Tuesday.\n\n\"So many great opportunities have come and we just don't want this to stop,\" one young man said.\n\nThey joined rallies outside while oral arguments began inside.\n\nIn Washington Heights, Rep. Adriano Espaillat, who supports DACA's renewal, was joined by DACA recipient Jose Lopez.\n\n\"I've been protected from being deported so that is just a sense of relief that if I'm walking around or taking public transit, I don't feel that I need to be scared if an official asks for identification,\" Lopez said.\n\nAs a recipient, Lopez has been authorized to attend college and work in the United States. He's among the estimated 700,000 young people who were brought to the U.S. illegaly as children.\n\nLopez was brought here from Mexico when he was just 5 years old. Now 23, the United States is the only home he knows.\n\n\"If you have DACA currently and your permit expires in a month, that means DACA would be over for you in a month,\" said Alba Lucero Villa, executive director of the Northern Manhattan Coalition for Immigrant Rights.\n\nWhat will the impact be on those who are not DACA recipients?\n\n\"It will drive many of them underground,\" Espaillat said.\n\nA second case being argued Tuesday tests whether the parents of a Mexican teenager who was killed by a U.S. border patrol agent in a shooting across the southern border in El Paso, Texas, can sue the agent in American courts.\n\nIf the court agrees with the administration in the DACA case, Congress could follow up by putting the program on surer legal footing. But the absence of comprehensive immigration reform from Congress is what prompted Obama to create DACA in 2012, giving people two-year renewable reprieves from the threat of deportation while also allowing them to work.\n\nFederal courts struck down an expansion of DACA and the creation of similar protections for undocumented immigrants whose children are U.S. citizens.\n\nTrump's anti-immigrant rhetoric was a key part of his presidential campaign in 2016, and his administration pointed to the invalidation of the expansion and the threat of a lawsuit against DACA by Texas and other Republican-led states as reasons to bring the program to a halt.\n\nYoung immigrants, civil rights groups, universities and Democratic-led cities and states sued to block the administration. They persuaded courts in New York, San Francisco and Washington, D.C., that the administration had been \"arbitrary and capricious\" in its actions, in violation of a federal law that requires policy changes to be done in an orderly way."

        "text": "In session after session behind closed doors last month, House Republicans repeatedly suggested that President Donald Trump's push for Ukraine to launch a series of criminal investigations into Joe Biden and alleged interference in the 2016 presidential election was about rooting out corruption, not investigating his political rival.\n\nAccording to some of Trump's staunchest allies, it was Ukraine, not Russia, that truly meddled in American democracy three years ago.\n\n\"Public reporting shows how senior Ukrainian officials interfered in the 2016 U.S. presidential campaign in favor of Secretary Clinton and in opposition to then-candidate Trump,\" Republicans wrote in a memo of \"key points\" distributed Tuesday ahead of the House impeachment inquiry's first open hearings this week.\n\nBut behind closed doors, many of the witnesses who recently testified to House investigators balked at any such comparison to Russia's efforts.\n\n\"We're talking about a completely different scale of interference,\" Army Lt. Col. Alex Vindman, a National Security Council expert on Ukraine, testified.\n\nAt the Kremlin's direction, Russia's intelligence services waged a pro-Trump disinformation campaign on social media and secretly stole tens of thousands of private emails from the Democratic National Committee, the U.S. intelligence community concluded.\n\nThat government-backed campaign was a \"deep\" and \"insidious effort to undermine a foreign country's elections,\" Vindman said. In fact, last year the Justice Department indicted 25 Russian operatives for their alleged roles in election interference during the 2016 campaign \u2013 none has been taken into custody yet.\n\n\"What a couple of actors in Ukraine might do in order to tip the scales in one direction or another is very different,\" Vindman noted.\n\nNevertheless, based on the new Republican memo, questions to witnesses behind closed doors, and the Republicans' proposed witness list, Trump's House allies are likely to promote such instances during this week's hearings.\n\nAs Republicans see it, Ukrainian \"interference\" in the 2016 campaign contributed to Trump's \"deep-seated\" skepticism of Ukraine, any delay in Trump engaging with Ukrainian leadership earlier this year was not about pressuring them to launch politically-charged investigations, it was about Trump's \"reasonable\" concerns, according to the Republican memo distributed Tuesday.\n\nHere are the instances of alleged Ukrainian interference that Republicans might raise during this week's public testimony:\n\nUkrainians disclosed the 'black ledger'\nIn August 2016, three months before the U.S. election, a Ukrainian anti-corruption office and a Ukrainian journalist-turned-lawmaker, Serhiy Leshchenko, released records showing that Trump's campaign chairman, Paul Manafort, had received millions of dollars in payments suspected of coming from ill-gotten proceeds in Ukraine. The records \u2013 part of a so-called \"black ledger\" \u2013 were found at the past estate of Viktor Yanukovych, the former Ukrainian president who hired Manafort as a political consultant and then fled to Russia in 2014 amid allegations of corruption.\n\nThe release of the \"black ledger\" forced Manafort to resign from the Trump campaign. Leshchenko has given conflicting accounts of what drove him to make the documents public, but in September he insisted in The Washington Post that he was \"angry at Manafort\" for protecting a corrupt leader and \"was motivated by the desire for justice.\"\n\nWhatever his motivation, Leshchenko and the head of the anti-corruption office were investigated and convicted in December 2018 of violating Ukrainian law by releasing the documents. Meanwhile, around the same time, Ukraine's top prosecutor was also feeding allegations about former vice president Joe Biden to Trump's personal attorney, Rudy Giuliani, who then launched a shadow campaign to have the allegations investigated.\n\nSeveral months after Leshchenko was convicted, a Ukrainian appeals court threw out the case and overturned the conviction. But in closed-door testimony last month, Republicans wanted to know why U.S. diplomats didn't do more to investigate Leshchenko's actions.\n\n\"Here we have a conviction of U.S. meddling, and you just viewed that as not being significant and you just dismissed it?\" Rep. Gordon Perry, R-Penn., asked Marie Yovanovitch, the former ambassador to Ukraine who was removed after Giuliani and others launched what she and her colleagues called a \"smear campaign\" against her.\n\nYovanovitch said it was \"our view\" that the case against Leshchenko wasn't \"credible.\"\n\n\"I didn't believe the charges,\" she said. \"I thought that they were politically motivated \u2026 [And] I really felt that we wanted to stay away from what seemed to be internal Ukrainian political fights kind of using us.\"\n\nIn March, conservative U.S. media began promoting claims that the Manafort-related documents made public may have been fake. The allegations were investigated and the documents were \"declared to be valid,\" but questions about them were still \"in the public domain,\" Volker testified, without specifying who validated the documents.\n\n\"Can you understand why [Trump] would want Ukraine to investigate why perhaps these ledgers were fabricated, if he had that belief?\" a House Republican investigator asked Volker.\n\n\"Yes,\" Volker responded.\n\nAsked during his testimony whether Leshchenko's actions would \"constitute election interference\" as it's currently understood, Vindman said: \"I don't think it would.\"\n\nA U.S. federal jury last year convicted Manafort of financial crimes related to his work for Ukraine's disgraced former president. The charges were brought by Special Counsel Robert Mueller, who had been investigating Russia's interference in the 2016 election.\n\nUkrainian's ties to 'dossier' firm\nRepublicans are also interested in Leshchenko because he was once a source of information for Fusion GPS, the research firm behind the controversial \"dossier\" that alleged members of Trump's campaign were coordinating with the Russian government to interfere in the 2016 election.\n\nA former researcher at the firm, Nellie Ohr, told lawmakers last year that Fusion GPS would pursue leads provided directly by Leshchenko.\n\nOhr's husband, Bruce, is the senior Justice Department official who acted as a conduit between the FBI and the author of the \"dossier,\" former British spy Christopher Steele. Republicans now want Democrats to call Ohr to testify in the impeachment probe.\n\nDNC contractor connected to Ukrainians\nRepublicans have also repeatedly asked in recent closed-door sessions about Alexandra Chalupa, who during the 2016 presidential campaign worked as a contractor for the Democratic National Committee running what she called \"an ethnic engagement program.\"\n\nYears earlier, while working for a different client, the Ukrainian-American based in Washington began researching Manafort's ties to Ukraine, and after Trump announced his candidacy in late 2015 she began looking at Trump's ties to Russia, occasionally sharing some of her findings with officials at the DNC, Chalupa later told Politico in a 2017 interview.\n\nIn March 2016, she also shared some of her findings with Ukraine's ambassador to the United States, Valeriy Chaly, she told Politico.\n\nAnd in an email two months later, she told a DNC spokesman that she had been \"digging into Manafort\" and was \"working with\" a prominent U.S. journalist whom she \"connected\" with \"the Ukrainians.\"\n\nThat email was among the tens of thousands of internal emails stolen from the DNC in 2016 and published online.\n\nIn a statement to CNN at the time, Chalupa insisted, \"I was not an opposition researcher for the DNC, and the DNC never asked me to go to the Ukrainian embassy to collect information.\" And in May, Chaly told The Hill newspaper that the Ukrainian embassy \"got to know Ms. Chalupa because of her engagement with Ukrainian and other diasporas in Washington, D.C., and not in her DNC capacity. We've learned about her DNC involvement later.\"\n\nChalupa's interest in Manafort was \"her own cause,\" and the embassy \"refused to get involved in any way,\" Chaly added.\n\nStill, her efforts have raised concerns among Republicans, who want Chalupa to testify this week.\n\nSo \"[Chalupa] may be another data point to the president's uncomfortable posture towards Ukraine?\" a House Republican investigator asked Volker.\n\n\"It's possible,\" Volker responded.\n\nPublic comments about Trump\nIn closed-door testimony last month, Republicans wondered what U.S. diplomats knew about public criticism of Trump from Ukrainian government officials.\n\nAmong other episodes, Republicans asked about an August 2016 op-ed published by Chaly, then the Ukrainian ambassador, who strongly criticized then-candidate Trump's pro-Russia rhetoric. In the op-ed, Chaly said Trump's comments \"call for appeasement of an aggressor.\"\n\nSimilarly, Ukraine's minister of Internal Affairs, Arsen Avakov, posted what one House investigator described as \"disparaging remarks about the President on Twitter and Facebook.\"\n\nBut Vindman rejected claims that those comments reflected any type of election interference from Ukraine, insisting acts of election interference \"are not open public displays.\"\n\nIn her testimony to House investigators, former National Security Council staffer Fiona Hill, an expert on Russia, said senior White House officials, including then-homeland security adviser Tom Bossert, tried early on in Trump's presidency to tell Trump that \"the alternative theory\" of Ukrainian election interference was false.\n\n\"I'm aware of the [allegations], but that doesn't mean that that amounts to an operation by the Ukrainian Government,\" she said.\n\nBossert, now an ABC News contributor, recently said the \"conspiracy theory\" of Ukrainian election interference \"has got to go.\"\n\n\"It is completely debunked,\" he told ABC News' George Stephanopoulos on \"This Week\" in September. \"They have to stop with that. It cannot continue to be repeated in our discourse.\"\n"

        "text": "Gov. Ron DeSantis on Friday appealed a federal judge's injunction in a lawsuit over Amendment 4, which restored the right to register to vote to felons earlier this year.\n\nThe injunction issued by U.S. District Judge Robert Hinkle last month required elections supervisors not to remove from the voter rolls 17 felons who are suing the state. They sued the state this year after DeSantis signed into law a bill requiring felons pay back all court fees, fines and restitution before being allowed to vote.\n\nThe 17 plaintiffs said they were either too poor to afford to pay back the hundreds or thousands of dollars they owe, or that court clerks were unable to tell them how much they owe.\n\nIn a statement, DeSantis' spokeswoman Helen Ferr\u00e9 accused the 17 plaintiffs of \"attempting to use the court process to re-write the scope and original intent of the amendment.\"\n\n\"The governor understands that protecting the integrity of our elections system is paramount and believes Floridians deserve greater clarification regarding the implementation of Amendment 4,\" spokeswoman Helen Ferr\u00e9 said in a statement.\n\nNearly two-thirds of voters last year voted for Amendment 4, which reversed a racist Jim Crow-era law by restoring the right to vote to nearly all felons who completed \"all terms\" of their sentence. But the definition of \"all terms\" has been the source of intense debate and national scrutiny. DeSantis opposed Amendment 4.\n\nThe creators of Amendment 4 said that \"all terms\" included the typically thousands of dollars in court fees, fines and restitution that are nearly always tacked on to felony convictions.\n\nThe Republican-led Legislature this year then passed a bill defining \"all terms\" to include those court costs.\n\nBut their bill was quickly denounced as a \"poll tax\" by critics, and some of the creators of Amendment 4 said lawmakers chose an overly broad interpretation. Many of those financial obligations are often converted to civil liens, sometimes immediately upon sentencing, for example, meaning the money is no longer part of the criminal court system.\n\nBy requiring felons pay back all financial obligations before voting, lawmakers drastically undercut the promise of Amendment 4, which was believed to restore the right to vote to up to 1.4 million Floridians.\n\nHundreds of thousands of those people are too poor to pay back their financial obligations, or at least to pay them back immediately. One woman owes $59 million, for example, likely making her unable to ever vote.\n\nIn his injunction, Hinkle wrote that being poor cannot stop people from voting, and that the Legislature must create a way for poor felons who owe money to vote.\n\nLawmakers were already working on tweaks to the law to address Hinkle's concerns and are expected to pass something next legislative session, before the case is scheduled to go to trial in April.\n\nThe injunction is being appealed to the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals.\n\n\"Appealing this order will provide quicker finality and certainty, allowing enough time to implement any protections and procedures for the restoration of voting rights prior to the November (2020) general election,\" Ferr\u00e9 said."

        "text": "WASHINGTON - The Republican staff member charged with questioning impeachment witnesses has served as an investigator in some of the biggest House probes of the last 15 years, including inquiries related to Hurricane Katrina, a gun-tracking operation known as \"Operation Fast and Furious\" and the 2012 terrorist attacks in Benghazi, Libya.\nYet the task facing Stephen Castor on Wednesday will be completely new, as Republicans seize the chance to bolster President Donald Trump's case that there was no quid pro quo involving Ukraine during the impeachment inquiry's first public hearing.\nCastor will help lead the effort as general counsel for the House Oversight and Reform Committee. In contrast with his Democratic counterpart - Daniel Goldman, a prosecutor turned television legal analyst - Castor has spent his career avoiding the media spotlight, rising through the ranks over nearly 15 years and seven consecutive chairmanships to become the Oversight panel's top GOP lawyer.\nCastor declined to comment for this story, but a half-dozen former colleagues and bosses praised him as a straight-shooting attorney whose deliberate, low-key style will make him an asset to Republicans amid intense public scrutiny of the impeachment hearings.\n\"It's not something he would have asked for,\" former Oversight Committee chairman Jason Chaffetz, R-Utah, who left the House in 2017, said of Castor's moment at center stage. \"It's not in his DNA to ask for something like this. He's a fairly unassuming guy, but he speaks with authority. . . . He'll just ask a few simple questions and demonstrate that there's no there there.\"\nAnother former Oversight chairman, Darrell Issa, R-Calif., said Castor will be focused on \"making complex things simple\" as he presents the GOP's case that Trump did not withhold military aid for Ukraine to force investigations that would benefit him politically. Issa said he \"wouldn't want to play poker against [Castor]\" because he \"doesn't easily give up what he's thinking.\"\n\"I did ask him - I guess last night - 'How do you feel about 11 million people watching you on television?' And he said, 'I'm going to look at the witness,' \" Issa said Tuesday.\nCastor, 46, was hired by then-Oversight Committee Chairman Tom Davis, R-Va., in 2005 after spending roughly four years as a commercial litigator at the Philadelphia and Washington offices of the law firm Blank Rome.\nOne of his first investigations involved the George W. Bush administration's response to Hurricane Katrina, giving him early experience in investigating a president from his own party. As part of its probe, the GOP-led committee held nine hearings, obtained more than 500,000 pages of documents and released a 569-page final report that was critical of the Bush White House.\nInvestigations during the Obama administration, such as the probes of the Benghazi attacks and the \"Fast and Furious\" scandal, were more controversial and politically charged.\nFormer bosses and colleagues said Castor, described by several as introverted, is an institutionalist who often acted as a bridge between opposing wings of the GOP.\n\"He's not a mean guy,\" said Davis, who left the House in 2008. \"I don't think he's a particularly ideological guy. He's just thorough and effective.\"\nIssa said Castor avoided political conversations during their decade-long working relationship, despite the explosive fights over policy and strategy between conservative and establishment Republicans on Capitol Hill that took place during that time.\nA review of Federal Election Commission records by The Washington Post showed that Castor has never donated to a political campaign.\n\"I don't know his politics,\" Issa said. \"I know he's a good family man. I know he loves his dog. . . . If he has an ideology or a political bent, we haven't seen it.\"\nCastor, 46, will be permitted to question witnesses on Wednesday because he is a staffer shared between the Oversight and Intelligence committees.\nThe Republican strategy, according to people familiar with GOP preparations for the hearing, will be to highlight ambiguities in the transcript of the July 25 call between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, and to point out where certain witnesses who learned about events secondhand may have jumped to conclusions about what took place during the broader saga. The people asked spoken on the condition of anonymity to discuss private conversations.\nWilliam Taylor Jr., the acting U.S. ambassador to Ukraine, will testify Wednesday alongside George Kent, deputy assistant secretary of state for Europe and Eurasian Affairs. Taylor's predecessor, Marie Yovanovitch, is scheduled to testify at a separate hearing on Friday.\nCastor described last year what he viewed as \"one of the best tools\" to use as the minority party on the Oversight panel - \"to just demonstrate that the investigator is not fair-minded and is not willing to keep an open mind.\"\n\"Once an investigator is revealed to be biased, it's hard to trust the integrity of the process,\" he said in December 2018 during an event hosted by the Federalist Society on Capitol Hill that was recorded for a podcast.\nTranscripts of closed-door depositions with impeachment witnesses reveal Castor to be a methodical and persistent questioner who sometimes tried to steer witnesses into more controversial territory, such as allegations about former vice president Joe Biden's family and Ukrainian influence on the 2016 election.\nHis approach sometimes led to tension or conflict.\nDuring the Oct. 14 deposition of Fiona Hill, the former senior director for Europe and Russia on the National Security Council, Hill said that she was targeted by right-wing media figures who falsely accused her of being part of a conspiracy involving George Soros, the liberal billionaire philanthropist.\nHill's lawyer, Lee Wolosky, interrupted her to say for the record that \"Mr. Castor laughed in response to that question.\"\n\"That is an outrageous - that is outrageous to say that I laughed at that,\" Castor said.\n\"You did laugh, and I want the record to reflect it because this is a very serious matter where people's lives potentially are in danger,\" Wolosky said.\nAfter some additional back-and-forth, Castor said, \"Well, that is, you know, an absolutely ridiculous characterization.\"\nCastor, a Philadelphia-area native, has rarely spoken in public about Trump or his work.\nBut last year, during a speech to a conference held by Wayne State University Law School, he called Trump a \"very different kind of president.\"\n\"Somebody of the president's personality being president and just - operating on Twitter is just - nobody could have expected that,\" he said in the March 2018 speech, which was recorded and posted to YouTube. Calling the size of the 2018 Women's March in Washington \"unbelievable,\" he said it was \"at a scale that was, you know, equal to or greater than some inaugurations.\" As some in the audience laughed, he smiled and said with emphasis, \"Inaugurations plural.\"\nCastor also made a light, indirect joke about the size of the crowd at Trump's inauguration while speaking about the \"intensity\" of the political moment.\nIn addition, Castor took issue with a May 2013 Bloomberg Businessweek headline that described him as a \"hidden hand\" behind the Oversight Committee. The article stated that \"no one in the White House looks forward\" to his calls.\n\"The Obama people - they really didn't care if I called them or not,\" he said. \"I very much don't like making phone calls. . . .

        "text": "The room was charged with electricity the day the House Judiciary Committee opened public hearings into whether to impeach the president of the United States. It felt like the whole world was watching. It felt like the whole world was on edge.\nIt was grand drama and soap opera at the same time \u2014 a constitutional seminar one moment and a high school food fight the next. The president's allies protested loudly. \"You are disrupting the continuity of this meeting!\" chastised the chairman trying to restore order. \"We're disrupting a railroad!\" one of the president's defenders shot back.\nTwenty-one years later, almost to the day, another House committee will open public hearings into whether to impeach another president, with plenty of grand drama and soap opera and food fight expected. As the first witnesses on Wednesday tell their stories to a televised audience in the case against Donald John Trump, shadowing the latest constitutional showdown will be the impeachment of William Jefferson Clinton.\nThe scene may be similar, but the allegations are radically different \u2014 lying under oath about sexual indiscretions versus using the power of the presidency to extract foreign help against domestic rivals. The two presidents in the dock are radically different as well, both defiant, angry and aggrieved, yet one strived to hide it and be seen as above the partisan mudslinging, while the other dives headlong into the mud, energetically slinging away.\nEven more transformed since the Clinton era is the Washington surround sound. As polarized as the political environment seemed in 1998 with the advent of the Drudge Report and Fox News, it has only become exponentially more so today with the rise of social media, the fragmentation of the news and opinion industry, the infiltration of conspiracy theories into the mainstream conversation and the empowerment of once-fringe forces. The 24/7 world of trolling and Twitter has split America into warring camps.\n\"It feels like our experience 20 years ago was \u2018Mayberry R.F.D.,' and Andy Griffith was our sheriff,\" said Lanny A. Breuer, who was one of the White House lawyers defending Mr. Clinton against impeachment. \"As bad as we thought it was \u2014 and it was terrible, it was crazy, it was a rough and tough time \u2014 but for some reason it seems much simpler than today.\"\nGov. Asa Hutchinson of Arkansas, who was a leading Republican member of the House Judiciary Committee that drafted four articles of impeachment against the president in 1998, said that the partisan divide that seemed so wide back then, \"the breach\" as Mr. Clinton termed it, has grown even more unbridgeable today.\n\"Twenty years ago, there was bipartisan work on process and bipartisan discussions on potential ways to resolve the dispute,\" said Mr. Hutchinson, who was among those who unsuccessfully explored the prospect of a bipartisan censure resolution rather than impeachment. \"Those discussions don't appear to be existent.\"\nYet in some ways, Washington rings with the echoes of 1998, only with the partisan roles reversed.\nThe Republicans complain about an unfair process today, using words like \"coup\" and \"lynching,\" just like the Democrats complained about an unfair process back then, using words like \"coup\" and \"lynching.\" The Democrats say they are acting on principle not partisanship today just like the Republicans said they were acting on principle not partisanship back then.\nThe trajectory also feels remarkably familiar, like a script that has been written awaiting only the actors to play it out. An opposition-controlled House heads toward a likely vote to impeach a president from the other side of the aisle along party lines, setting the stage for a Senate trial that seems poised to acquit for lack of the two-thirds vote required by the Constitution for conviction.\nIf Mr. Trump's troubles stem from foreign affairs, Mr. Clinton's were rooted in domestic affairs. His efforts to cover up his extramarital relationship with Monica S. Lewinsky, a onetime White House intern, when asked about it during a sexual harassment lawsuit led the House to impeach him for perjury and obstruction of justice. Only five Republicans and five Democrats crossed party lines on the key first vote, though dozens of Republicans joined Democrats to reject two of the four proposed articles.\nAfter a monthlong trial in the Senate in early 1999, Mr. Clinton was acquitted \u2014 less because of doubt that he did it than because of doubt that it was momentous enough to merit removal from office. Ultimately, a federal judge found Mr. Clinton in contempt of court and fined him; he acknowledged providing false testimony under oath, surrendered his law license for a time and settled the original harassment lawsuit for $850,000.\nLike Mr. Trump two decades later, Mr. Clinton saw himself as the victim of enemies who were out to get him from the start, the target of what Hillary Clinton memorably termed a \"vast right-wing conspiracy\" pursuing one faux scandal after another until they finally found one that stuck.\nThe phrase \"witch hunt\" was a regular staple of Democratic talking points in that era. Mr. Clinton's camp pilloried Ken Starr, the independent counsel, much as Mr. Trump has denigrated Robert S. Mueller III, the special counsel in the Russia investigation.\nAnd there were ugly moments of collateral damage. Larry Flynt, the Hustler magazine publisher, offered a $1 million bounty for stories of adultery by members of Congress, which among other things resulted in the resignation of the next Republican speaker on the same day that Mr. Clinton was impeached.\nMr. Clinton benefited throughout his battle with Congress from a strong economy, just as Mr. Trump does today. But Mr. Clinton was a significantly more popular president from the start, and most Americans opposed impeachment even though they did not like his conduct. His approval ratings were above 60 percent throughout the proceedings and in fact went up to 73 percent after the House impeachment vote.\nMr. Trump, by contrast, has never had anywhere near as much support from the public, with his latest Gallup approval rating at 41 percent. Judging by polls, many Americans see the allegations against Mr. Trump as far more weighty than lying under oath about sex, although they remain divided sharply along party lines in their views.\nOne fundamental difference is that the House in 1998 was operating on the results of an investigation conducted by Mr. Starr. In fact, the only fact witness called during the House public hearings that opened on Nov. 19, 1998, was Mr. Starr himself.\n\"You can't compare where we are and where we were,\" said former Speaker Newt Gingrich, who led the impeachment drive in 1998 only to step down after Republicans lost midterm elections. \"We had a report from Starr that used the word \u2018guilty' on 11 counts, one of which was perjury, which is a felony. After all of Mueller's efforts, they couldn't get him to use the word \u2018guilty.'\"\nIndeed, House Democrats this year simply put Mr. Mueller's report on Russia aside and instead are conducting their own investigation into Mr. Trump's pressure on Ukraine to provide incriminating information about Democrats even as he withheld American security aid. The witnesses who will begin testifying on Wednesday \u2014 William B. Taylor Jr., the top American diplomat in Ukraine, and George P. Kent, a deputy assistant secretary of state \u2014 were right in the middle of the events in question.\n\"It is extraordinary how members of Trump's own administration have been instrumental in building the case for impeachment,\" said Robert F. Bauer, the top lawyer for House and Senate Democrats during the Clinton impeachment battle who went on to become White House counsel for President Barack Obama. \"And we have yet to hear from John Bolton.\"\nJohn R. Bolton, Mr. Trump's former national security adviser, remains perhaps the most coveted witness for Democrats because he opposed Mr. Trump's pressure campaign on Ukraine, but he is waiting for a court to decide whether he should testify.\nJulian Epstein, the counsel to House Judiciary Democrats in 1998, said there was a much stronger case for high crimes against Mr. Trump than there was against Mr. Clinton.\n\"What's the same as '98 is it's easier to play defense than offense,\" he said. \"This is especially so in the age of distraction where we are addicted to social media and self-reinforcing news bubbles on our smartphone. It's harder to get everyone into the public square and keep attention spans to hear the larger narrative. That's the Democrats' challenge.\"\nBy the time Mr. Starr testified in 1998, the country knew the story pretty well, but the House Democrats this year face the task of explaining what happened through witnesses like Mr. Taylor and Mr. Kent.\nRepublicans are still settling on their defense. Mr. Trump says his interactions with Ukraine were \"perfect.\" Few Republicans go that far. Some agree that the president's approach was inappropriate but maintain it is not worthy of impeachment. Others argue that Democrats are twisting the facts to criminalize foreign policy out of animus for Mr. Trump.\n\"This stuff's all garbage,\" Mr. Gingrich said. \"It's been really astonishing to me how corrupt it's been. It's shamelessly corrupt.\"\nOne advantage Mr. Trump has is that he owns his party far more than Mr. Clinton ever did the Democrats. While many Republican lawmakers are not fond of Mr. Trump and would happily rid themselves of him if they could, by and large they are sticking by him in public.\nIn 1998, 31 House Democrats voted to start the impeachment inquiry against Mr. Clinton, and the White House was relieved there were not more; not one Republican voted this year to authorize an impeachment inquiry against Mr. Trump. In 1998, Democrats felt perfectly free to criticize Mr. Clinton without fear of reprisal; only a handful of elected Republicans have criticized Mr. Trump on the Ukraine matter.\nMr. Clinton and his allies were in constant fear that Democrats would turn on him and pressure him to resign the way Republicans did President Richard M. Nixon in 1974. Absent a drastic change in political circumstances, it is hard to imagine Republicans breaking with Mr. Trump en masse.\nWhat is different from 1998, though, is that Mr. Clinton was in his second term and would never face voters again. Mr. Trump's impeachment battle comes just as his re-election campaign is getting underway in earnest. If the Senate does not convict him, as expected, then the ultimate appeals court would be the electorate next November.\nRahm Emanuel, who was a senior adviser to Mr. Clinton in 1998 and went on to become Mr. Obama's chief of staff and the mayor of Chicago, argued that last week's Democratic off-year election victories along with the midterm elections of 2018 showed that Republicans who stick with Mr. Trump may ultimately pay a price in 2020.\n\"There's nothing this guy does that can help them,\" Mr. Emanuel said. \"They're going to have to make the decision that they're willing to tie the knot even tighter between him and them.\"\nAnd then it will be up to voters to decide.\n\n\nIt was grand drama and soap opera at the same time ?a constitutional seminar one moment and a high school food fight the next. The president\u8ab7 allies protested loudly. \u8953ou are disrupting the continuity of this meeting!?chastised the chairman trying to restore order. \u8951e\u8ab6e disrupting a railroad!?one of the president\u8ab7 defenders shot back.\n\nTwenty-one years later, almost to the day, another House committee will open public hearings into whether to impeach another president, with plenty of grand drama and soap opera and food fight expected. As the first witnesses on Wednesday tell their stories to a televised audience in the case against Donald John Trump, shadowing the latest constitutional showdown will be the impeachment of William Jefferson Clinton.\n\nThe scene may be similar, but the allegations are radically different ?lying under oath about sexual indiscretions versus using the power of the presidency to extract foreign help against domestic rivals. The two presidents in the dock are radically different as well, both defiant, angry and aggrieved, yet one strived to hide it and be seen as above the partisan mudslinging, while the other dives headlong into the mud, energetically slinging away.\n\nEven more transformed since the Clinton era is the Washington surround sound. As polarized as the political environment seemed in 1998 with the advent of the Drudge Report and Fox News, it has only become exponentially more so today with the rise of social media, the fragmentation of the news and opinion industry, the infiltration of conspiracy theories into the mainstream conversation and the empowerment of once-fringe forces. The 24/7 world of trolling and Twitter has split America into warring camps.\n\n\u8942t feels like our experience 20 years ago was \u8a2bayberry R.F.D.,?and Andy Griffith was our sheriff,?said Lanny A. Breuer, who was one of the White House lawyers defending Mr. Clinton against impeachment. \u8939s bad as we thought it was ?and it was terrible, it was crazy, it was a rough and tough time ?but for some reason it seems much simpler than today.?\nGov. Asa Hutchinson of Arkansas, who was a leading Republican member of the House Judiciary Committee that drafted four articles of impeachment against the president in 1998, said that the partisan divide that seemed so wide back then, \u8971he breach?as Mr. Clinton termed it, has grown even more unbridgeable today.\n\n\u894ewenty years ago, there was bipartisan work on process and bipartisan discussions on potential ways to resolve the dispute,?said Mr. Hutchinson, who was among those who unsuccessfully explored the prospect of a bipartisan censure resolution rather than impeachment. \u894ehose discussions don\u8ab8 appear to be existent.?\nYet in some ways, Washington rings with the echoes of 1998, only with the partisan roles reversed.\n\nThe Republicans complain about an unfair process today, using words like \u895doup?and \u8969ynching,?just like the Democrats complained about an unfair process back then, using words like \u895doup?and \u8969ynching.?The Democrats say they are acting on principle not partisanship today just like the Republicans said they were acting on principle not partisanship back then.\n\nThe trajectory also feels remarkably familiar, like a script that has been written awaiting only the actors to play it out. An opposition-controlled House heads toward a likely vote to impeach a president from the other side of the aisle along party lines, setting the stage for a Senate trial that seems poised to acquit for lack of the two-thirds vote required by the Constitution for conviction.\n\nIf Mr. Trump\u8ab7 troubles stem from foreign affairs, Mr. Clinton\u8ab7 were rooted in domestic affairs. His efforts to cover up his extramarital relationship with Monica S. Lewinsky, a onetime White House intern, when asked about it during a sexual harassment lawsuit led the House to impeach him for perjury and obstruction of justice. Only five Republicans and five Democrats crossed party lines on the key first vote, though dozens of Republicans joined Democrats to reject two of the four proposed articles.\n\nAfter a monthlong trial in the Senate in early 1999, Mr. Clinton was acquitted ?less because of doubt that he did it than because of doubt that it was momentous enough to merit removal from office. Ultimately, a federal judge found Mr. Clinton in contempt of court and fined him; he acknowledged providing false testimony under oath, surrendered his law license for a time and settled the original harassment lawsuit for $850,000.\n\nLike Mr. Trump two decades later, Mr. Clinton saw himself as the victim of enemies who were out to get him from the start, the target of what Hillary Clinton memorably termed a \u8973ast right-wing conspiracy?pursuing one faux scandal after another until they finally found one that stuck.\n\nThe phrase \u8974itch hunt?was a regular staple of Democratic talking points in that era. Mr. Clinton\u8ab7 camp pilloried Ken Starr, the independent counsel, much as Mr. Trump has denigrated Robert S. Mueller III, the special counsel in the Russia investigation.\n\nAnd there were ugly moments of collateral damage. Larry Flynt, the Hustler magazine publisher, offered a $1 million bounty for stories of adultery by members of Congress, which among other things resulted in the resignation of the next Republican speaker on the same day that Mr. Clinton was impeached.\n\nMr. Clinton benefited throughout his battle with Congress from a strong economy, just as Mr. Trump does today. But Mr. Clinton was a significantly more popular president from the start, and most Americans opposed impeachment even though they did not like his conduct. His approval ratings were above 60 percent throughout the proceedings and in fact went up to 73 percent after the House impeachment vote.\n\nMr. Trump, by contrast, has never had anywhere near as much support from the public, with his latest Gallup approval rating at 41 percent. Judging by polls, many Americans see the allegations against Mr. Trump as far more weighty than lying under oath about sex, although they remain divided sharply along party lines in their views.\n\nOne fundamental difference is that the House in 1998 was operating on the results of an investigation conducted by Mr. Starr. In fact, the only fact witness called during the House public hearings that opened on Nov. 19, 1998, was Mr. Starr himself.\n\n\u8953ou can\u8ab8 compare where we are and where we were,?said former Speaker Newt Gingrich, who led the impeachment drive in 1998 only to step down after Republicans lost midterm elections. \u8951e had a report from Starr that used the word \u8a46uilty?on 11 counts, one of which was perjury, which is a felony. After all of Mueller\u8ab7 efforts, they couldn\u8ab8 get him to use the word \u8a46uilty.\u6cbc\n\nIndeed, House Democrats this year simply put Mr. Mueller\u8ab7 report on Russia aside and instead are conducting their own investigation into Mr. Trump\u8ab7 pressure on Ukraine to provide incriminating information about Democrats even as he withheld American security aid. The witnesses who will begin testifying on Wednesday ?William B. Taylor Jr., the top American diplomat in Ukraine, and George P. Kent, a deputy assistant secretary of state ?were right in the middle of the events in question.\n\n\u8942t is extraordinary how members of Trump\u8ab7 own administration have been instrumental in building the case for impeachment,?said Robert F. Bauer, the top lawyer for House and Senate Democrats during the Clinton impeachment battle who went on to become White House counsel for President Barack Obama. \u8939nd we have yet to hear from John Bolton.?\nJohn R. Bolton, Mr. Trump\u8ab7 former national security adviser, remains perhaps the most coveted witness for Democrats because he opposed Mr. Trump\u8ab7 pressure campaign on Ukraine, but he is waiting for a court to decide whether he should testify.\n\nJulian Epstein, the counsel to House Judiciary Democrats in 1998, said there was a much stronger case for high crimes against Mr. Trump than there was against Mr. Clinton.\n\n\u8951hat\u8ab7 the same as ?8 is it\u8ab7 easier to play defense than offense,?he said. \u894ehis is especially so in the age of distraction where we are addicted to social media and self-reinforcing news bubbles on our smartphone.

        "text": "Congress can seek eight years of President Trump's tax records, according to a federal appeals court order Wednesday that moves the separation-of-powers conflict one step closer to the Supreme Court.\n\nThe U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit let stand an earlier ruling against the president that affirmed Congress's investigative authority on a day when the House was holding its first public impeachment inquiry hearing. Trump lawyer Jay Sekulow said in response to Wednesday's decision that the president's legal team \"will be seeking review at the Supreme Court.\"\n\nThe D.C. Circuit was responding to Trump's request to have a full panel of judges rehear a three-judge decision from October that rejected the president's request to block lawmakers from subpoenaing his longtime accounting firm.\n\nAppeals court rules against Trump in fight with Congress over president's accounting firm records\n\nA majority of the court's 11 active judges voted against revisiting the case. Three judges \u2014 Neomi Rao, Gregory Katsas and Karen LeCraft Henderson \u2014 indicated that they would have granted the rehearing and published dissenting statements. Rao and Katsas, both former Trump administration officials, were nominated to the bench by the president.\n\n\"This case presents exceptionally important questions regarding the separation of powers,\" Katsas wrote.\n\nHe warned of the \"threat to presidential autonomy and independence\" and said it would be \"open season on the President's personal records\" if Congress is allowed to compel the president to disclose personal records based on the possibility that it might inform legislation.\n\nThe court's order does not mean Trump's tax records will be turned over to Congress immediately. The D.C. Circuit previously said it would put any ruling against the president on hold for seven days to give Trump's attorneys time to ask the Supreme Court to step in.\n\nSekulow in a statement cited the \"well reasoned dissent\" in Trump's decision to go to the Supreme Court.\n\nTrump's attorneys also are planning to ask the high court as soon as Thursday to block a similar subpoena for the president's tax records from the Manhattan district attorney, who is investigating hush-money payments in the lead-up to the 2016 election. The New York-based appeals court ruled against Trump this month and refused to block the subpoena to his accounting firm, Mazars USA.\n\nThe D.C. Circuit case centers on a House Oversight Committee subpoena from March for the president's accounting firm records \u2014 issued months before the beginning of its impeachment inquiry, related to Trump's alleged efforts to pressure Ukraine to investigate political rival Joe Biden.\n\nThe request for information followed testimony from Trump's former personal attorney Michael Cohen that Trump had exaggerated his wealth when he sought loans. Lawmakers are investigating potential conflicts of interest, including the accuracy of the president's financial disclosures.\n\nA divided three-judge panel of the court held in October that the House had issued its subpoena for \"legitimate legislative pursuits, not an impermissible law-enforcement purpose,\" as the president's lawyers had argued.\n\n\"Contrary to the President's arguments, the Committee possesses authority under both the House Rules and the Constitution to issue the subpoena, and Mazars must comply,\" wrote Judge David S. Tatel, who was joined by Judge Patricia A. Millett. Both were nominated by Democratic presidents.\n\nJudge rules against Trump in fight over president's financial records\n\nRao, the dissenting judge on the panel, restated her view that the committee had exceeded its authority with a legislative subpoena \"investigating whether the President broke the law.\"\n\n\"By upholding this subpoena, the panel opinion has shifted the balance of power between Congress and the President and allowed a congressional committee to circumvent the careful process of impeachment,\" she wrote.\n\nThe House subsequently passed, after the initial panel opinion, a resolution affirming its impeachment inquiry.\n\nBut Rao wrote Wednesday that the committee \"is wrong to suggest\" that questions about the validity of the subpoena \"are no longer of \u2018practical consequence.' \"\n\nIt is an open question, she said, \"whether a defective subpoena can be revived by after-the-fact approval.\"\n"

        "text": "President Trump has been threatening for weeks to fire acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney, but senior advisers have counseled him to hold off on such a drastic step amid a high-stakes impeachment probe, according to three people familiar with the discussions.\n\nTrump has expressed particular anger over Mulvaney's performance in an Oct. 17 news conference in which Mulvaney stunned White House aides by saying military aid to Ukraine was withheld to pressure its government to launch investigations that could politically benefit Trump, two of the people said. Later, Mulvaney issued a statement saying the media had misconstrued his televised comments and that \"there was absolutely no quid pro quo.\"\n\nSenior advisers have cautioned Trump that removing Mulvaney at such a sensitive time could be perilous, the people said \u2014 both because Mulvaney played an integral role in the decision to freeze the aid, and because of the disruption that would be caused by replacing one of Trump's most senior aides.\n\n\"I don't think you'll see him going anywhere until after December,\" said one Trump adviser, who like others spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss private conversations. \"But the president was very unhappy with that press conference. That was a very bad day for the president.\"\n\nWhite House officials declined to comment Tuesday.\n\nMulvaney had direct talks with Trump about the president's desire to withhold nearly $400 million in security aid to Ukraine, The Washington Post has reported. At the same time, Trump and other allies were pressuring Ukraine to open an investigation of Democratic rival Joe Biden and of theories about the country's role in the 2016 election, according to congressional testimony in the impeachment inquiry.\n\nTrump's advisers have cited as a cautionary tale the example of national security adviser John Bolton, who was dismissed in September. Bolton is now a sought-after witness for Democrats, and despite White House instructions to defy a congressional subpoena has expressed a willingness to testify if cleared by a judge.\n\nOther advisers have counseled the president that its unwise to replace his chief of staff and create turmoil while Trump is dealing with the multiple brush fires of a congressional impeachment probe.\n\n\"Trump is back asking everyone what they think about Mulvaney,\" said one senior U.S. official. \"He clearly is upset with him. He's being advised that the last thing he needs is another major personnel move.\"\n\nMulvaney's relationship with Trump garnered new scrutiny Tuesday when he called off plans to file a lawsuit asking the courts to rule on whether he should comply with a House subpoena to testify in the impeachment inquiry. Instead he announced he would follow the president's broad directive barring aides from participating in the inquiry.\n\nSome current and former aides have nonetheless chosen to comply with subpoenas from Congress. Others, such as Bolton, have indicated they would look to the courts for guidance on competing demands from two branches of government.\n\nTuesday's court filing by Mulvaney came amid growing rancor inside the White House over how to respond to the impeachment investigation. Mulvaney has clashed with White House counsel Pat Cipollone over how to navigate the inquiry, in which public hearings are set to begin Wednesday.\n\nThe about-face was also the latest in a series of high-profile course changes by Mulvaney as he comes under fire from Capitol Hill and from present and former colleagues in the White House.\n\nOn Monday, Mulvaney's legal team had notified the court that he planned to file his own lawsuit against the House seeking court guidance on how to respond to a subpoena for his testimony. The lawsuit, his attorney said, would be related to one filed earlier by Bolton's top deputy, Charles Kupperman.\n\nMulvaney's lawyers noted in a court filing Tuesday that \"after further consideration,\" Mulvaney had decided not to go to court at all. \"Rather he will rely on the direction of the President, as supported by an opinion of the Office of Legal Counsel of the U.S. Department of Justice, in not appearing\" before the House, Mulvaney's lawyers said.\n\nMulvaney's initial effort to join the Kupperman lawsuit rankled Bolton and Kupperman because they had cited Mulvaney as a critical player in the effort to press the Ukrainian government to pursue investigations helpful to Trump's domestic political agenda, a move they viewed as improper.\n\nOutside legal experts saw Mulvaney's move to join the case as an effort to secure some legal cover given he had potential exposure because of his private actions seeking to withhold aid to Ukraine and his conflicting public statements about the motives for that blockade.\n\nThe abrupt change in legal strategy confounded national legal experts, as well as senior advisers to the president.\n\n\"None of it made any sense to me. What we're seeing right now is not only disarray but almost jaw-dropping incompetence,\" Chris Whipple, who has written a biography on White House chiefs of staff and has interviewed most living ones, said of Mulvaney's moves.\n"

        "title": "The GOP Ukraine defense asks us to believe Trump cared deeply about things he rarely discussed",
        "text": "OverOver the course of the first day of public testimony in the House impeachment inquiry, Republicans outlined a somewhat sketchy defense of President Trump. At its heart were two lines of argument: that Trump's interest in a strong Ukraine was well established (neutralizing, they hoped, the halt Trump placed on providing aid to that country) and that his efforts to get Ukraine to launch new investigations were rooted in his obvious opposition to corruption.\n\n\"As we'll learn in these hearings,\" the House Intelligence Committee's ranking Republican, Devin Nunes (Calif.), said on Wednesday, \"after expressing skepticism of foreign aid and concern about foreign corruption on the campaign trail, President Trump outraged the bureaucracy by acting skeptically about foreign aid and expressing concerns about foreign corruption.\"\n\nThe problem with that argument in particular is that it's directly at odds with all other available evidence. It is not only not the case that Trump has not focused on corruption to any significant degree as president and it is not only the case that Trump has basically not focused on corruption in Ukraine at all, but it isn't even the case that Trump focused on corruption in Ukraine in the call he had with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. For all of Trump's regular insistences that America \"read the transcript\" \u2014 that is, the rough transcript of the Trump-Zelensky call \u2014 House Republicans on Wednesday essentially asked that Americans not to read the transcript, lest they learn just how little of a focus Trump put on the subject.\n\nWe all understand that Trump is not someone who keeps his passions bottled up inside. A review of Trump's public comments compiled by Factba.se shows that he has, in fact, talked about corrupt entities and corruption regularly, particularly in the last year.\n\nBut his mentions of corruption as president have almost exclusively been pejorative: his labeling of political opponents, the D.C. \"swamp\" or the media as corrupt. His mentions of corruption in the context of governments beyond the U.S. federal government make up about 1 in 6 of his uses of the term before September of this year, when the Ukraine scandal broke.\n\nHe talked about corruption in the context of Ukraine only once before September. By contrast, he'd talked about corruption in Iran a number of times. He's talked about purported corruption by social media companies more than corruption in Ukraine. He's talked far more about corruption in Puerto Rico than in Kyiv.\n\nEven corruption in Romania came up more often than corruption in Ukraine. Trump talked about corruption in that country during press availabilities after meetings with Romanian leaders. When Trump twice met with former Ukrainian president Petro Poroshenko, on neither occasion did he mention corruption.\n\nHe did not mention it in his call with Zelensky, either.\n\nAt no point before September did Trump mention any of the specific allegations that his attorney Rudolph W. Giuliani mentions in an opinion piece published by the Wall Street Journal on Tuesday, allegations that Giuliani claims spurred Trump's requests for investigations in the Zelensky call. Trump never mentioned, for example, the release of documents in August 2016 exposing under-the-table payments to his then-campaign manager Paul Manafort. That document release was cited by Giuliani as a rationale for Trump asking Zelensky to probe \"Ukrainian interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential election.\"\n\nThat's not what Trump requested of Zelensky, of course, but we'll come back to that.\n\nOverall, Trump has talked about Ukraine less frequently than he has corruption.\n\nThere were times that Trump mentioned allegations that Ukraine had some role in interfering in the 2016 election. He lifted up a Sean Hannity report in July 2017, for example, that was based on sketchy Politico article from earlier that year. In March, he highlighted a similar claim made by writer John Solomon (which had come to his attention via Hannity). In neither case did he get into any of the specifics mentioned by Giuliani or House Republicans. At no point, for example, did he mention the DNC contractor who sits at the center of the allegation, a woman named by both Giuliani and Nunes.\n\nParticularly in the months leading up to September, Trump's mentions of Ukraine often centered specifically on the allegations that were included in Trump's requests of Zelensky: the debunked claim that former vice president Joe Biden had acted corruptly in regard to Ukraine and a claim that Ukraine had somehow been involved in misleading the world about the hacking of the Democratic National Committee in 2016.\n\nHis claims about Ukraine having some role in the DNC hacking extend back to an April 2017 interview with the Associated Press. The peak of his accusations against Biden came in May of this year, correlating to a report in the New York Times articulating the Biden charges.\n\nThat May mention of corruption in the context of Ukraine? It was a retweet of the Times reporter who'd lifted up the spurious Biden allegations \u2014 the same reporter, incidentally, who wrote the 2017 Politico article.\n\nTrump has talked far more often about very specific requests he made to Zelensky than the more general concerns Republicans and Giuliani insist motivated his requests. What Trump asked Zelensky to look at was what Biden and his son had done in Ukraine and whether Ukraine had a DNC server or a link to the DNC hacking. Those are both things he talked about publicly in the spring and summer of this year.\n\nWhen Trump talked about corruption generally before the emergence of the Ukraine scandal, he was mostly using the term to disparage a news media that insists on accurately describing what he's done.\n the course of the first day of public testimony in the House impeachment inquiry, Republicans outlined a somewhat sketchy defense of President Trump. At its heart were two lines of argument: that Trump's interest in a strong Ukraine was well established (neutralizing, they hoped, the halt Trump placed on providing aid to that country) and that his efforts to get Ukraine to launch new investigations were rooted in his obvious opposition to corruption."

        "text": "Former Massachusetts Gov. Deval Patrick made one of the latest entries into the Democratic presidential primary and has struggled for attention in the crowded race.\n\nPatrick has worked at the NAACP Legal Defense Fund, the Civil Rights Division of the Department of Justice and Bain Capital, the same investment firm Mitt Romney took heat for founding during his presidential run.\n\nPatrick, whose campaign is hurting for endorsements, money, organization and attention due to his late entry, is narrowing his focus to New Hampshire and South Carolina with the goal of building momentum to stick in the race for the long haul.\n\nHere is where Patrick stands on some of the top issues voters care about in the 2020 campaign.\n\nHealth care\n\nPatrick has said he decided to get into the race so late because he did not feel any of the Democrats running had a sufficiently unifying vision. He fittingly takes a more moderate position on health care compared to many of the party's progressives. He proposes a public option that would compete with private insurance in order to drive costs down.\n\nWHERE DOES JOE BIDEN STAND ON THE ISSUES?\n\nThis is in contrast to the \"Medicare-for-All\" plans supported by Sens. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., and Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., which would eliminate private insurance from the market.\n\n\"The public option will be more cost effective to the government and affordable to consumers. The competitive tension between the private and public systems will force insurers to reduce the cost of insurance, and improve offerings overall,\" Patrick says on his website.\n\nPatrick also promises to end surprise billing by backing legislation that addresses the issue and work to increase the government's leverage in negotiating drug prices.\n\nClimate and environment\n\nPatrick touts his experience in Washington, DC, and running a state as some of his top assets as a candidate. On the environment, Patrick claims he has more experience than anyone.\n\n\"As governor of Massachusetts, I confronted climate change head-on a decade before other political leaders were even paying attention to this issue,\" he tweeted in January. \"Others have big deas for taking on climate change; I have results.\"\n\nWHERE DOES ELIZABETH WARREN STAND ON THE ISSUES?\n\nPatrick has not been a vocal supporter of some of the more radical climate change agendas floated within the Democratic party, particularly Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez's Green New Deal resolution. The climate plan on his campaign website, however, sets a goal of bringing the U.S. to net-zero carbon emissions by 2040, which is a decade earlier than the goal most other candidates set.\n\nBut Patrick's climate plan is based almost exclusively on technology and green energy, leaving out many of the social justice elements in the Green New Deal.\n\nEconomy and minimum wage\n\nWith income inequality and corporate power major issues in the Democratic primary, many candidates have seized on the 2017 tax cuts passed by President Trump and congressional Republicans as a campaign issue. Those cuts dropped the corporate income tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent, leaving many Democrats calling for an increase back to 35 percent.\n\nPatrick wants to raise corporate income tax rates to 25 percent, \"reflecting the current consensus among the business community for a globally competitive rate.\" He would not stop there, however.\n\nPatrick would eliminate capital gains taxes. Instead, he would treat income made through investment the same as any other form of income, eliminate \"hundreds of deductions, exclusions and credits\" in the tax system and boost the estate tax to 55 percent, with an exemption for the first $10 million.\n\n\"Government is about how we define the civilization we want; taxes are how we pay for it,\" Patrick says on his website. \"Our guiding principle will be the belief that taxes are not a penalty but just the cost of our civilization.\"\n\nImmigration\n\nPatrick advocates a \"compassionate\" immigration policy that also includes border security, an issue that is non-existant to many Democratic candidates.\n\n\"Rather than caging children and demeaning families, we will support comprehensive immigration reform that provides a path to citizenship for undocumented residents of our country, Dreamers and others in the country without legal status,\" Patrick writes on his website. \"We must also secure our borders and other ports of entry, but with more modern, more effective and less ham-fisted ways than a physical wall.\"\n\nAddressing the roots of the problem, Patrick wants to \"streamline\" the way foreigners can get visas to work in the U.S. and speed up the naturalization process, \"ending the endless backlog that frustrates the dreams of so many aspiring Americans and pushes others into illegal border crossings rather than legal processes. We will make naturalization more affordable and more attractive for eligible permanent residents.\"\n\nBut despite his innovative proposals, Patrick does hold standard Democratic positions on allowing a pathway to citizenship for illegal immigrants already in the U.S. and protecting \"Dreamers\" brought to America before they were 18 from deportation.\n\nCriminal justice\n\nPatrick, like most of the Democratic field, wants to decriminalize marijuana but allow states to manage their cannabis policies. Additionally, he would push \"support for legal marijuana entrepreneurs in communities disproportionately affected by criminal marijuana enforcement,\" reflecting the social justice goals of the Marijuana Opportunity Reinvestment and Expungement Act (MORE Act) which is popular among congressional Democrats.\n\nHe also says he will eliminate mandatory minimum sentences, abolish private prisons, push for a more diverse judicial branch and increase funds for public defenders -- the often overworked and underpaid lawyers who represent criminal defendants who don't have the money for their own counsel.\n\nPatrick, like the entire rest of the Democratic field, is against the death penalty. He promises to immediately stop federal executions while making an effort to stop state executions as well.\n\n\"The Patrick Administration will use every tool at its disposal to prevent states from carrying out executions using cruel and experimental means, including by reversing the Trump Administration\u8ab7 refusal to regulate the importation of death penalty drugs,\" Patrick writes on his website."

        "text": "President Trump is expected to watch some of the impeachment inquiry hearings on TV Wednesday, White House officials told CBS News, and staff will be set up to \"react in real time\" with a \"rapid response.\"  \n\nThe impeachment inquiry stems from a whistleblower complaint that raised concerns about a July 25 call between Mr. Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. During the call, Mr. Trump urged Zelensky to investigate political rival Joe Biden, as well as a conspiracy theory that Ukraine has a server related to the 2016 hacking of emails from the Democratic National Committee.\n\nOn Wednesday, William Taylor, the top U.S. diplomat in Ukraine, and Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for European and Eurasian Affairs George Kent will testify before the House Intelligence Committee.\n\nHere's what to expect in response, White House officials told CBS News:\n\nPresident Trump will be watching the hearings ?at least in part ?on television. However, the White House does not expect him to be sitting in front of a TV focused solely on the hearings.\n\nThe response team will include staffers from the White House press and communications teams, as well as the White House counsel and legislative affairs offices.\n\nThe White House will be \"aggressively pushing back on TV, radio, in print, with digital efforts,\" including Twitter. The White House will also emphasize what they believe is \"incredibly unfair process\" by the Democrats.\n\nWhite House press secretary Stephanie Grisham is likely to put out a statement when the hearings conclude.\n\nThe White House is planning on not only getting its message out on a national level but also to local and regional outlets.\n\nIn the past several weeks, the White House has been meeting with Republican lawmakers in an effort to have a unified front against Democrats. The president or senior staff has met with 120 House members and 42 Senators. While most of the meetings have taken place at the White House, some have occurred at Camp David over the past several weekends, with 40 congressman making overnight visits to the presidential retreat in Maryland?a rarity for even some of the most senior of the representatives. It hasn't been all work ?visits have included two movie nights (no word on which movies, however).\n\nTeams have been coordinating daily with surrogates and pro-Trump groups. White House officials also said that the president has sent envoys from the White House \"every day\" to meet with House Republican \"communicators\" on messaging for impeachment.\n\nThe officials reiterated that the White House plans to soon release the transcript of President Trump's first call with Zelensky, which occurred in April. This call, they say, \"will further emphasize how the president's conversations prove he did nothing wrong.\" \n\nThere are three key messages the White House is pushing: \"The president has done nothing wrong. Read the transcript,\" the senior White House official said, echoing the president's frequent tweets regarding the call with Zelensky.\n\nSecond, \"whether you're Republican, Democrat or independent, you understand fundamental fairness, and due process under the Constitution is not being granted. It is not being given,\" a senior White House official said. \"People understand that at its core.\" \n\nAnd third, \"Democrats are doing nothing else,\" referring to inaction in Congress. \n\n\"You can't just activate this [effort] this week. This stuff has to be built out over time,\" the official said. \" And we have built it. It is ready to go.\" \n\nHouse Intelligence Chairman Adam Schiff says his committee's goal \"is to present the facts in a serious and sober manner.\"\n\nDemocrats are relying on this week's witnesses to \"begin to flesh out the details of the president's effort to coerce a foreign nation to engage in political investigations designed to help his campaign, a corrupt undertaking that is evident from his own words on the July 25 call record,\" Schiff said.\n\nAccording to a Democratic aide working on the inquiry, it will be incumbent on Republicans or the White House to \"either provide exculpatory evidence ?or explain to the American people why it's okay for a President to use the power of his office to taint our elections in his favor.\""

        "text": "In weeks of closed-door testimony, American officials who worked in Ukraine kept circling back to the work of one journalist, John Solomon, whose articles they said appeared to have considerable currency with President Trump's inner circle.\n\nThey had never known Mr. Solomon to be an authority on Ukrainian politics before, and certainly not someone with particular insights into the American ambassador to Ukraine who was a frequent target of his. So when Rudolph W. Giuliani, Donald Trump Jr. and the president himself started talking about his stories, those officials began closely following what he wrote.\n\nAsked how she first learned of Mr. Giuliani's interest in Ukraine, Fiona Hill, Mr. Trump's former adviser on Russia and Europe, replied, in part, \"John Solomon.\"\n\nMr. Solomon has been a surprisingly central figure in the impeachment proceedings so far. But the glare has not been so kind.\n\nOne witness testified to Congress that an article of his was full of \"non-truths and non sequiturs.\" Another witness said that he could not recall a single thing that was correct in one of Mr. Solomon's stories, then added sarcastically, \"His grammar might have been right.\"\n\nSo who exactly is John Solomon? A Washington-based reporter and Fox News personality who had until recently been working at the politics outlet The Hill, Mr. Solomon, 52, is not well known outside conservative media. But, according to interviews and testimony, his writing and commentary helped trigger the chain of events that are now the subject of the impeachment inquiry into Mr. Trump.\n\nThough he worked for years at The Associated Press and briefly at The Washington Post, he moved on from mainstream outlets and now sits at the center of a network of conservative journalists, radio hosts, cable news pundits and activists whose work reaches millions of Americans every day, and shapes the way a large swath of the country sees this pivotal moment.\n\nUnderstanding their work is key to explaining how Mr. Trump's approval ratings remain so durable with his base \u2014 and why, as some polls suggest, far more direct and damaging evidence would have to emerge from the impeachment hearings that begin their public phase on Wednesday for that support to crack.\n\nAccording to transcripts released last week, Mr. Solomon and his pieces for The Hill are a focus for congressional investigators as they look into Mr. Trump's efforts to push Ukrainian officials to investigate his rivals. One particular area of interest for Democrats, the transcripts show, is Mr. Solomon's role in advancing claims by Mr. Giuliani, the president's personal attorney, that former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. and his family deserved to be investigated for their own dealings in Ukraine.\n\nIn an interview, Mr. Giuliani said he turned to Mr. Solomon earlier this year with a cache of information he believed contained damaging details about Mr. Biden, his son, Hunter Biden, and the special counsel Robert S. Mueller III's investigation of Russian interference in the 2016 election.\n\"I really turned my stuff over to John Solomon,\" Mr. Giuliani said. \"I had no other choice,\" he added, asserting that Obama-era officials still \"infected\" the Justice Department and wouldn't have diligently investigated the information he had compiled.\n\n\"So I said here's the way to do it \u2014 I'm going to give it to the watchdogs of integrity, the fourth estate,\" he said.\n\n\u2018The Woodward and Bernsteins of our time'\nMr. Solomon's work has been endorsed by some of the most influential figures on the right like Sean Hannity, Rush Limbaugh and the president, who has highlighted Mr. Solomon's articles on Twitter.\n\nMark Levin, the radio and Fox host, recently said that Mr. Solomon and Sara Carter, a journalist with whom he frequently appears on television, were \"like the Woodward and Bernsteins of our time.\"\n\nMedia scholars describe the environment that has elevated Mr. Solomon's stories as an information ecosystem entirely sealed off from other news coverage.\n\nNicole Hemmer, a historian at Columbia University who studies the conservative media, said people often mistakenly refer to the Fox News-talk radio world as an \"echo chamber\" of opinion when in fact it is more like \"an interconnected set of authorities.\"\n\n\"Sean Hannity talks about John Solomon,\" she said, \"and then that gets picked up on Rush and Levin.\" The effect, she added, is that his reporting carries weight with conservative audiences. \"That gives it an authority when they're hearing it from multiple sources every day.\"\n\nWhen Mr. Solomon appears on television and the radio, Mr. Hannity and other conservative hosts often identify him as an investigative reporter and cite his decades of experience at news organizations like The A.P. But his critics see this as a sleight of hand to give his writing a veneer of nonpartisan objectivity.\n\n\"Part of the issue is that for years he was identified with the mainstream media,\" said James Manley, a former aide to Harry Reid, the former Senate majority leader who tangled with Mr. Solomon in the 2000s over stories insinuating Mr. Reid had benefited inappropriately from his office. The Columbia Journalism Review later singled out Mr. Solomon's reporting, saying it was \"much ado about very little.\"\n\nAn examination of Mr. Solomon's reporting methods and interviews with people who have worked with him during his decades-long career in Washington show that his techniques blur the boundaries meant to keep journalist-source relationships at an arm's length. And for some of his biggest stories on Ukraine, he has relied on a prosecutor with a history of making inconsistent statements who is now under criminal investigation.\n\nAt one point while he was employed as a columnist for The Hill and publishing regular pieces favorable to the president, Mr. Solomon discussed with colleagues a proposal to create a transparency office in the Trump White House. Some colleagues believed he might have wanted to run this office, according to a person with direct knowledge of the situation.\n\n(Unlike Fox, The Hill put a disclaimer over Mr. Solomon's writing indicating that it was opinion starting in May of 2018 after complaints from colleagues about what they saw as one-sidedness in his work, The Post reported at the time.)\n\nMr. Solomon denied that he has ever sought work in any administration and said the transparency office proposal had \"nothing to do with seeking a job.\" He added, \"It had to do with fostering an idea for more transparency.\" As for the attacks on his work from the impeachment witnesses, he said, \"The N.S.C. and State officials are entitled to their opinions of my reporting.\"\n\nA close look at one piece by Mr. Solomon shows how far one of his assertions, later called into doubt, can reverberate at the highest levels of the government.\n\nIn late March, Mr. Solomon and his team published pieces in The Hill making sensational claims of misconduct at the State Department: The American ambassador to Ukraine, a career foreign service officer who assumed her post during the Obama administration, had privately bad-mouthed Mr. Trump and, separately, had previously provided to Yuriy Lutsenko, Ukraine's prosecutor general at the time, a list of individuals that Mr. Lutsenko should not prosecute. In conservative circles, where suspicion of anti-Trump officials working inside the government runs high, the allegation fit with the narrative that institutions like the State Department are rife with bad actors.\n\nBut there was less to the do-not-prosecute list than it appeared. The State Department dismissed it as \"an outright fabrication.\" Mr. Lutsenko changed his story and acknowledged that what he is quoted describing in Mr. Solomon's report \u2014 \"a list of people whom we should not prosecute\" given to him by the ambassador \u2014 did not actually exist.\n\nIn an interview with The New York Times last month, Mr. Lutsenko blamed the confusion on the interpreter who handled his interview with The Hill. But he insisted that the ambassador, Marie Yovanovitch, had in fact asked him not to target certain politicians and activists who worked with the embassy on its anti-corruption efforts.\n\nBut among Mr. Trump's allies and media boosters, the story line was set: A corrupt ambassador who did not like the president was misusing her authority to protect her friends. In the whistle-blower complaint that set off the impeachment inquiry, those articles and others by Mr. Solomon are cited as among the key events leading up to Mr. Trump's demand that the Ukranians do him \"a favor\" and investigate the Bidens.\n\nMr. Solomon said in an email that Mr. Lutsenko was adamant he had not changed his story when the two spoke for a follow-up interview. The back-and-forth over the existence of a formal list, he said, is a \"classic he-said, she-said dispute,\" which he believes his coverage accurately reflected. \"The idea I should have some regret for accurately quoting a major news figure in Ukraine is preposterous,\" he said.\n\nThe \"don't prosecute\" story gained considerable traction in conservative media. It drew the attention of the president's son, Donald Trump Jr., who in March tweeted that Ms. Yovanovitch was a \"joker\" who shouldn't be in the job. In May, the Trump administration recalled her from her position.\n\nIn his testimony, Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman, the top Ukraine expert on the National Security Council, seemed alarmed at how quickly Mr. Solomon's story was amplified by high-profile figures like Mr. Giuliani and Mr. Trump's son. He testified that the entire thing \"smelled really rotten.\"\n\n\u2018Reporting truth' with unusual methods\nMr. Solomon grew up in Connecticut where his father was a police officer and later served as chief of police for the town of Easton. Before working for conservative outlets, he held senior reporting jobs at a number of mainstream organizations, including The A.P., where he worked for almost 20 years, and The Post, where he pursued investigative projects that often focused on federal law enforcement.\n\nMr. Solomon won an award in 2002 for coordinating the A.P.'s investigations into the law enforcement failures that preceded the Sept. 11 attacks. He joined The Post in 2007 but stayed only a short period before leaving for the Washington Times, telling his bosses that he could not pass up the large salary the conservative paper was offering.\n\nHis work at The Hill since 2017 has generated the most notice and controversy of his career. His reporting was of considerable value to the outlet's publisher, James Finkelstein, who has been friends with Mr. Trump for decades and saw Mr. Solomon as a high-profile hire whose frequent Fox News appearances could help generate buzz and traffic for the website.\n\nWhile Mr. Solomon was at The Hill, his relationships with sources were sometimes closer than reporters typically get with the people they cover. In March, according to documents uncovered as part of the impeachment inquiry, he shared a draft of one of his stories before publication with a noteworthy group: people who had helped gather the information that Mr. Giuliani had provided to Mr. Solomon.\n\nThey included Victoria Toensing and Joe diGenova, two lawyers who have been working with Mr. Giuliani to undermine the investigations into Mr. Trump, and Lev Parnas, a Ukrainian-American businessman who helped connect Mr. Giuliani to Mr. Lutsenko. Mr. Solomon said \"I do go over stories in advance\" with sources for accuracy, not to tip them off to the content.\n\nMr. Solomon left The Hill in September under circumstances that neither he nor the paper have fully described. He has not said what his new venture will be \u2014 or how it is being funded \u2014 other than to describe it to former colleagues as a media start-up. For the time being, he is publishing his work on his personal website. His slogan is \"Reporting Truth.\""

The Constitution sets a dramatic, but vague, [bar for impeachment,](https://www.apnews.com/ee2fb9f93be24535a50b665cd9372efc) and there's no consensus yet that [Trump's actions at the heart of the inquiry](https://apnews.com/273e46e2fa324eb9ba5d69ab2a2c69cb) meet the threshold of \"high crimes and misdemeanors.\"\n\nWhether Wednesday's proceedings begin to end a presidency or help secure Trump's position, it's certain that his chaotic term has finally arrived at a place he cannot control and a force, the constitutional system of checks and balances, that he cannot ignore.\n\nThe country has been here [just three times before,](https://apnews.com/cd45ec8474fb4df080f5d98c1ecfba79) and never against the backdrop of social media and real-time commentary, including from the Republican president himself.\n\n\"These hearings will address subjects of profound consequence for the Nation and the functioning of our government under the Constitution,\" said Democratic Rep. Adam Schiff of California, the chairman of the Intelligence Committee leading the inquiry, in a memo to lawmakers.\n\n\"Total impeachment scam,\" tweeted the president, as he does virtually every day.\n\nImpeachments are rare, historians say, because they amount to nothing short of the nullification of an election. Starting down this road poses risks for both Democrats and Republicans as proceedings push into the 2020 campaign.\n\nUnlike the Watergate hearings and Richard Nixon, there is not yet a \"cancer on the presidency\" moment galvanizing public opinion. Nor is there the national shrug, as happened when Bill Clinton's impeachment ultimately didn't result in his removal from office. It's perhaps most like the partisanship-infused impeachment of Andrew Johnson after the Civil War.\n\nTrump calls the whole thing a \"witch hunt,\" a retort that echoes Nixon's own defense. Republicans say Democrats have been trying to get rid of this president since he took office, starting with [former special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation](https://apnews.com/48f9d5132d7a4e2d823edad8fc407979) into Russian interference to help Trump in the 2016 election.\n\nDemocratic House Speaker Nancy Pelosi was initially reluctant to [launch a formal impeachment inquiry.](https://apnews.com/a9a0bed9f81343b7a725a9adcd84e01b) As Democrats took control of the House in January, Pelosi said impeachment would be \"too divisive\" for the country. Trump, she said, was simply \"not worth it.\"\n\nAfter Mueller's appearance on Capitol Hill in July for the end of the Russia probe, the door to impeachment proceedings seemed closed.\n\nFor the past month, witness after witness has testified under oath about [his July 25 phone call](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/6429034-White-House-memo-on-Trump-call-with-Ukraine.html) with Ukraine's newly elected president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, and the alarms it set off in U.S. diplomatic and national security circles.\n\nIn a secure room in the Capitol basement, current and former officials have been telling lawmakers what they know. They've said an earlier Trump call in April congratulating Zelenskiy on his election victory seemed fine. The former U.S. reality TV host and the young Ukrainian comedian hit it off.\n\nBut in the July call, things turned.\n\nAn [anonymous whistleblower](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/6430369-whistleblower-complaint.html) first alerted officials to the phone call. \"I have received information from multiple U.S. Government officials that the President of the United States is using the power of his office to solicit interference from a foreign country in the 2020 election,\" the person wrote in August to the House and Senate Intelligence committees. Democrats fought for the letter to be released to them as required.\n\n\"I am deeply concerned,\" the whistleblower wrote.\n\nTrump insisted the call was \"perfect.\" The White House released a rough transcript. Pelosi, given the nod from her most centrist freshman lawmakers, opened the inquiry.\n\n\"The president has his opportunity to prove his innocence,\" she told Noticias Telemundo on Tuesday.\n\nDefying White House orders not to appear, witnesses have testified that Trump's acting chief of staff, Mick Mulvaney, was withholding U.S. military aid to the budding democracy until the new Ukraine government conducted investigations Trump wanted into Democrats in the 2016 election and his potential 2020 rival, Joe Biden, and his son, Hunter.\n\nIt was all part of what Taylor, the long-serving top diplomat in Ukraine, called the \"irregular\" foreign policy being led by Trump's personal attorney, Rudy Giuliani, outside of traditional channels.\n\nTaylor said it was \"crazy\" that the Trump administration was withholding U.S. military assistance to the East European ally over the political investigations, with Russian forces on Ukraine's border on watch for a moment of weakness.\n\nKent, the bowtie-wearing State Department official, told investigators there were three things Trump wanted of Ukraine: \"Investigations, Biden, Clinton.\"\n\nOn Friday, the public is scheduled to hear from Marie Yovanovitch, the former U.S. ambassador to Ukraine, who told investigators she was warned to \"watch my back\" as Trump undercut and then recalled her.\n\nEight more witnesses will testify in public hearings next week.\n\n\"What this affords is the opportunity for the cream of our diplomatic corps to tell the American people a clear and consistent story of what the president did,\" said Rep. Mike Quigley, D-Ill., a member of the Intelligence panel.\n\n\"It takes a lot of courage to do what they are doing,\" he said, \"and they are probably just going to be abused for it.\"\n\nRepublicans, led on the panel by Rep. Devin Nunes, a longtime Trump ally from California, will argue that none of those witnesses has first-hand knowledge of the president's actions. They will say Ukraine never felt pressured and the aid money eventually flowed, in September.\n\nYet Republicans are struggling to form a unified defense of Trump. Instead they often fall back on criticism of the process.\n\nSome Republicans align with Trump's view, which is outside of mainstream intelligence findings, that Ukraine was involved in 2016 U.S. election interference. They want to hear from Hunter Biden, who served on the board of a gas company in Ukraine, Burisma, while his father was the vice president. And they are trying to bring forward the still-anonymous whistleblower, whose identity Democrats have vowed to protect.\n\nThe framers of the Constitution provided few details about how the impeachment proceedings should be run, leaving much for Congress to decide. Democrats say the White House's refusal to provide witnesses or produce documents is obstruction and itself impeachable.\n\nHearings are expected to continue and will shift, likely by Thanksgiving, to the Judiciary Committee to consider actual articles of impeachment.\n\nThe House, which is controlled by Democrats, is expected to vote by Christmas.\n\nThat would launch a trial in the Senate, where Republicans have the majority, in the new year."

        "title": "At donor dinner, Giuliani associate said he discussed Ukraine with Trump, according to people familiar with his account",
        "text": "The April 2018 dinner was designed to be an intimate affair, an opportunity for a handful of big donors to a super PAC allied with President Trump to personally interact with the president and his eldest son.\n\nIn an exclusive suite known as the Trump Townhouse at Trump's Washington hotel, the group \u2014 including Jack Nicklaus III, the grandson of the famous golfer, and a New York developer \u2014 snapped photos, dined and chatted about their pet issues with the president for about 90 minutes.\n\nAmong those in attendance were two Florida business executives who had little history with Republican politics but had snagged a spot at the dinner with the promise of a major contribution to the America First super PAC. They turned the conversation to Ukraine, according to people familiar with the event, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe the private dinner.\n\nOne of the men, Lev Parnas, has described to associates that he and his business partner, Igor Fruman, told Trump at the dinner that they thought the U.S. ambassador to Ukraine was unfriendly to the president and his interests.\n\nAccording to Parnas, the president reacted strongly to the news: Trump immediately suggested that then-Ambassador Marie -Yovanovitch, who had been in the Foreign Service for 32 years and served under Democratic and Republican presidents, should be fired, people familiar with his account said.\n\nHow two Soviet-born emigres made it into elite Trump circles \u2014 and the center of the impeachment storm\n\nParnas declined to comment. Todd Blanche, a lawyer for Fruman, declined to comment.\n\nThe White House did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nParnas's account of personally discussing Ukraine with Trump more than 18 months ago suggests that he and Fruman had more personal interaction with the president \u2014 and potentially more influence over his views on that country \u2014 than the White House has acknowledged.\n\nTrump has said he does not know the two men, who later partnered with Trump's personal attorney Rudolph W. Giuliani to hunt for damaging material about Democrats in Ukraine before being charged last month with funneling foreign money into campaign contributions. They have pleaded not guilty.\n\n\"Now it's possible I have a picture with them because I have a picture with everybody,\" the president said the day after they were arrested at Dulles International Airport last month, adding: \"I don't know what they do, but, I don't know, maybe they were clients of Rudy.\"\n\nBut the two men had some personal interactions with Trump, both before and after they met Giuliani in the summer of 2018. Those included encounters at a Florida fundraiser in 2016 and during a visit to Mar-a-Lago, the president's private estate, according to social media accounts and people who encountered them.\n\nParnas's account of the 2018 dinner is the first indication that he or Fruman interacted directly with Trump about Ukraine. His description of their conversation suggests that the Boca Raton businessman, who emigrated as a child from Ukraine, could hold key information about Trump's pressure campaign on his home country \u2014 an effort that set in motion the ongoing impeachment inquiry.\n\nThe president was updated regularly by Giuliani on what he was learning about Parnas's and Fruman's efforts in Ukraine, according to a former senior administration official who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the ongoing investigation.\n\n\"It's just not true that he had no idea who these guys were. He knew Lev particularly,\" the person said.\n\nIn February, Parnas and Fruman met with Ukraine's then-president, Petro Poroshenko, according to Edward B. MacMahon Jr., a lawyer for Parnas. They were doing so, he said, on a request from Giuliani, who was acting on orders from Trump.\n\nMacMahon said the two proposed that in exchange for a state visit, the Ukrainian president would announce investigations into former vice president Joe Biden's son and an unfounded theory that Ukraine interfered in the 2016 presidential race.\n\nGiuliani associates pressed past president of Ukraine to announce Biden investigation in exchange for state visit\n\nIn an interview last week, Giuliani declined to comment on his interactions with the two men, citing the criminal investigation. But he said Parnas and Fruman already had met the president when he first encountered them in the summer of 2018. \"I did not introduce them to the president,\" he said.\n\nIn an interview with The Washington Post before his arrest, Parnas said he got involved in the Trump campaign because he admired the real estate developer, whom he said he had met several times before the election.\n\n\"I think he's going to go down as one of the greatest presidents ever, even with all this negativity,\" he said.\n\nParnas's attorneys have now indicated that he is disappointed with Trump's efforts to distance himself, suggesting that he may be willing to cooperate with the congressional inquiry.\n\n\"There isn't anything that Parnas did in the Ukraine relative to the Bidens or the 2016 election that he wasn't asked to do by Giuliani, who was acting on the direction of the president,\" MacMahon said.\n\nBut it is not clear if Democrats are interested in negotiating for his testimony, given the criminal case filed against him in New York.\n\nProsecutors have alleged that Parnas and Fruman gave campaign contributions to the pro-Trump super PAC and other political committees in an effort \"to advance their personal financial interests and the political interests of at least one Ukrainian government official with whom they were working.\"\n\nYovanovitch testified that she was told by a Ukrainian official in February that Parnas and Fruman were working with Giuliani and that they were \"interested in having a different ambassador at post, I guess for \u2014 because they wanted to have business dealings in Ukraine or additional business dealings.\"\n\nAn attorney for Parnas, Joseph A. Bondy, said that he \"denies having participated in the President and Mr. Guiliani's efforts to remove Ambassador Yovanovitch at the request of Ukrainian government officials or to benefit his and Mr. Fruman's prospective liquefied natural gas business interests in Ukraine.\"\n\nHowever, people who spoke to Parnas and Fruman said that they spoke often of their displeasure with Yovanovitch and claimed they had personally discussed the ambassador with Trump on more than one occasion.\n\n\"They were constantly complaining about her,\" said one person in touch with the duo starting in the summer of 2018.\n\nThe person said they were \"constantly shellshocked\" that Trump had stated clearly to them that he wanted to get rid of Yovanovitch, but that many months passed and she remained in place.\n\nIn an interview with The Post last month, Giuliani said that Trump blamed the State Department for slow-walking his desire to remove Yovanovitch. \"The president fired her three times and thought she was gone,\" he said. \"The president thought she was gone long before she was actually fired.\"\n\nMore than a year after the dinner at the Trump hotel, Yovanovitch was summarily removed from her post following a campaign in conservative media to paint her as an Obama administration holdover opposed to Trump. She testified that she was told by State Department officials that she had done nothing wrong but that the president had been advocating for her removal since the summer of 2018. She denied that she been in any way disloyal to Trump.\n\nTwo months after Yovanovitch's removal, Zelensky and Trump discussed her in the phone conversation that sparked calls for Trump's impeachment. According to a rough transcript released by the White House, Zelensky told Trump: \"It was great that you were the first one who told me that she was a bad ambassador because I agree with you 100%.\" It is not clear when Trump first told Zelensky about the ambassador.\n\nTrump responded, \"Well, she's going to go through some things.\"\n\nThe president's hostility to Yovanovitch appears to have begun even earlier than previously known. He reacted strongly when her role in Ukraine came up with Parnas and Fruman at the April 30, 2018, dinner at his Washington hotel, according to Parnas's account.\n\nTrump's eldest son, Donald Trump Jr., was also in attendance. Alan Futerfas, an attorney for Trump Jr., said in a statement that \"over the past few years, he has attended literally hundreds of donor events. Nothing about this one stands out.\"\n\nThe president's son stoked conservative anger toward Yovanovitch this spring by retweeting an article calling for her removal and saying we need \"less of these jokers as ambassadors.\"\n\nThe Trump hotel dinner was one of several events for top donors, designed to show that the super PAC was the right venue for supporters to send large checks, according to a person familiar with the event who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the private dinner.\n\nKelly Sadler, a spokeswoman for the super PAC, said the roundtable dinner was \"typical of the dinners arranged for potential donors.\"\n\nAbout 15 people were in attendance, including Nicklaus, according to people familiar with the event. Also in attendance, they said, was Stanley Gale, a real estate developer from New York, whose company developed a massive complex in South Korea, including a golf course designed by Nicklaus. Gale pitched the president on using his property to host a summit with the leader of North Korea, according to people familiar with the dinner.\n\nNicklaus did not respond to requests for comment. Gale declined to comment.\n\nIn addition to Nicklaus, other attendees included Tommy Hicks Jr., a Republican fundraiser who is close friends with Trump's son, as well as Roy Bailey, a Texas businessman who has served as a top Trump fundraiser and is close to Giuliani, the people said. Neither responded to requests for comment.\n\nAfter the dinner, Parnas posted photos of it on social media, erroneously tagging it as having been held at the White House.\n\nIn one image, he stood with Trump between two American flags, giving a thumbs-up.\n\n\"Thank you President Trump !!!\" he wrote, adding, \"incredible dinner and even better conversation.\"\n"

The sheriff's office handles all law enforcement, court and jail duties.\n\nFollowing Tuesday's election, the re-elected chair of the Board of Supervisors, Phyllis Randall, a Democrat, said she plans to introduce the idea of adding a police department to take over law enforcement.\n\n\"Law enforcement should just never be political,\" she said over the phone Saturday.\n\nA sheriff is elected every four years, whereas Randall said a police chief would be hired by the County Administrator. The administrator is a non-elected position that is hired by the Board.\n\nMike Chapman, a Republican, was also just re-elected, after first taking office in 2012.\n\nRELATED: She flipped off the president, then she got fired. Now, she's an elected leader\n\n\"In the past, people who did not support the sheriff and his run, their contracts have not been renewed,\" Randall said. \"So, over the last four years many of them\u2026have come to not just me but other supervisors and said\u2026we need to have some security in our positions, and that comes with a police chief.\"\n\nSheriff Mike Chapman said it is true that he didn't rehire some people when he took over, but he said he kept close to 99% of the staff. This year, he said he's on track to renew everyone's contracts.\n\nThe sheriff completely disagrees with Randall's stance, believing that a police department would actually be worse for constituents.\n\n\"I answer directly to them, and that's an important thing, to answer directly to the people that you serve,\" Sheriff Chapman said. \"To take that option away from the people that want to elect you, it's insulting the public. It's telling them that you're too stupid to make that decision.\"\n\nHe advised against changing a system that has been successful for Loudoun County. The sheriff said since he took office, the crime rate has decreased by 32%, and the recidivism rate has declined by 10%.\n\nBy that same data from the Metropolitan Washington Council of Governments, Arlington County has also seen a significant reduction in crime during the same period--35%.\n\nArlington has had a police department in addition to a sheriff's office for decades.\n\n\"A sheriff is able, because he answers to no one, to tell people what he wants to tell them,\" Randall said. \"A police chief is answerable to someone, the county administrator, and that person is looking over their stats and their numbers and their information.\"\n\nSheriff Chapman said he is wary of the head of law enforcement being answerable to someone who is not an expert in law enforcement.\n\n\"I think it would be really ill-advised to have someone, a group of people\u2026who know practically nothing about law enforcement directing me, the top law enforcement official to follow their will,\" he said.\n\nRegardless of what either leader believes, the supervisor said the decision would be put to a referendum as early as 2020, so the public would have the chance to vote on whether or not they want a police department.\n"

        "text": "President Trump said Saturday that a transcript of another call he had with the president of Ukraine will \"probably\" be released on Tuesday. The call took place in April after Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky was elected.\n\nConcerns about Mr. Trump's July 25 call with Zelensky, where he asked Ukraine to investigate political rival Joe Biden, sparked the ongoing House impeachment inquiry.\n\nMr. Trump spoke to reporters before boarding Air Force One to travel to Alabama for the Alabama-LSU football game. He repeated his assertion that the impeachment inquiry is a \"witch hunt.\"\n\n\"Now they wanna have a transcript of the other call, the second call, and I'm willing to provide that, we'll probably give it to you on Tuesday. Monday being a holiday,\" he said. \n\n\"But here's the deal. Read the transcript, you'll see the call. Now, I'll give you a second transcript because I actually had two calls with the President of Ukraine so you'll read the second call and you'll tell me if you think there's anything wrong with it,\" Mr. Trump added.\n\nHe had suggested to reporters on Friday that he would release the transcript of the April call with Zelensky.\n\n\"I had a second call with the president which actually, I believe, came before this one, and now they all want that one. And if they want it, I'll give it to them,\" Mr. Trump said on Friday, seemingly referring to House investigators.\n\nMr. Trump has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing in his July 25 call, where he asked Zelensky to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden and his son, Hunter Biden. He has urged the public to read the transcript of that call that was released by the White House in September. \n\nThat document, however, is not an exact transcript, but instead a memorandum summarizing the call. Alexander Vindman, a National Security Counsel official who participated in the call, said in a closed hearing before the House Intelligence Committee that the call summary released by the White House had removed certain words and phrases.\n\nIn his testimony, Vindman said Mr. Trump commented during the July 25 call that there were \"recordings\" of misdeeds by former Vice President Joe Biden. According to Vindman's recollections and his contemporaneous notes of the call, Mr. Trump's comments that \"there are recordings\" were replaced in the call summary by ellipses.\n\nIn this portion of the call, Mr. Trump said, \"Biden went around bragging that he stopped the prosecution, so if you can look into it.\" This is followed in the call summary by ellipses, but Vindman was saying that the next words were \"There are recordings.\" \n\nVindman also said Zelensky specifically referred in the call to Burisma, the Ukrainian gas firm with ties to Hunter Biden. But the call summary replaced that with \"the company.\"\n\nHe told lawmakers that the details about the edits are not just the way he remembers them. \"This is what's in my notes,\" he said. These notes are \"in my highly classified notebook,\" Vindman said.\n\nThe House Intelligence Committee will hold the first open hearings as part of the impeachment inquiry next week. On Wednesday, Americans will hear from Bill Taylor, the U.S. special envoy to Ukraine; and George Kent, deputy assistant secretary of state for European and Eurasian Affairs. On Friday, they will hear from Marie Yovanovitch, the former U.S. ambassador to Ukraine."

        "text": "U.S. Sen. Ron Johnson is urging President Donald Trump not to move forward with flavor restrictions for vaping products, citing worries about job losses and fewer alternatives for cigarette smokers.  \n\n\"I am supportive of regulations that ensure the safety of consumer products, and common-sense efforts that prevent youth access to e-cigarettes,\" Johnson wrote in a letter to Trump dated Wednesday. \"But I am strongly opposed to far-reaching, unchecked government action that stifles innovation and restricts adults?freedom to choose safer alternatives to smoking.\"\n\nPresident Donald Trump arrives  with Wisconsin Sen. Ron Johnson to deliver a speech to supporters in Green Bay April 27, 2019.\nThe Food and Drug Administration is expected to release soon Trump's plan to restrict sales of vaping products, which have been tied to a surge of lung injuries and even deaths.\n\nAmong the expected rules are raising the age to purchase them legally from 18 to 21 and potentially restrictions on flavors in an effort to curb vaping use among teens. \n\n\u8951e\u8ab6e going to be coming out with an important position on vaping,?Trump said Friday. \u8951e have to take care of our kids.\"\n\nIn an interview Wednesday with the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, Johnson said he supports raising the age to purchase e-cigarettes and vaping products to 21.\n\n\"I am also concerned about children vaping,\" Johnson said. \"And my guess is that the industry has a lot to atone for in terms of what they've done pretty overtly to attract youth to this product.\"\n\nHe added that he is concerned that Trump is going \"overboard\" with the flavor ban, adding that it could fuel a dangerous, unregulated black market for vaping products.\n\n\"I'm trying to get him not to do this,\" Johnson said. \"This goes overboard.\"\n\nHe added, \"This is being rammed through too fast without proper consideration.\"\n\nFor several years, Johnson has been the leading opponent of vaping regulations in Congress. \n\nIn 2016, the Wisconsin Republican thanked vapers on his election night for helping him defeat Democratic candidate Russ Feingold. \n\nA year later, he was the keynote speaker at a Vapor Technology Association conference at the Trump International Hotel in Washington, D.C.  There, Johnson called on the FDA  to pull back on a rule requiring e-cigarette makers to get federal approval.\n\nMore than 2,000 people who have used such products have been sickened and 39 have died, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Just last week, the CDC announced it had discovered a potential cause of the injuries: a derivative of vitamin E in the lungs of patients hospitalized after vaping. \n\nThe additive can be used to dilute THC oil, which has been found to be common in the recent outbreak of vaping-related injuries. \n\nJohnson in his letter to Trump said banning many flavors would put some vaping product manufacturers out of business and potentially could destroy the vaping industry. \n\n\"Many stakeholders in the e-cigarette industry are small businesses ?over 10,000 according to some estimates ?so an outright ban on the most popular flavors purchased by adults will likely force them to close,\" Johnson said. \n\nBut health advocates say lobbying to soften or abandon rules for vaping products could lead to sustained teen use of vaping products.\n\n\"We urge the Administration to keep its promise to moms, dads and kids across the country and clear the market of all flavored e-cigarettes,\" the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids said in a statement. \"If it fails to do so, it will be responsible for allowing another addiction crisis to happen on its watch.\"\n\nJohnson also said in his letter the potential restrictions could lead to \" a significant cost to public health.\"\n\n\"If former smokers cannot access products that they have used to kick the habit, they could very well return to less healthy alternatives like smoking cigarettes or purchasing illicit products on the black market,\" he wrote.\n\nJohnson joins vaping advocates in opposing the potential ban on flavors, including Americans for Tax Reform and the American Conservative Union. \n\nVaping giant Juul Labs already has suspended online sales of its non-tobacco, non-menthol flavored products in the U.S. and has suspended sales of its mint, mango, creme, fruit and cucumber flavors in retail stores. \n\nJournal Sentinel reporters Daniel Bice and Raquel Rutledge contributed to this report.\n"

        "text": "President Donald Trump suggested Thursday that the impeachment process was taking a personal toll, calling impeachment a \"problem\" that had been \"very hard on my family.\"\n\n\"I have one problem. And it has been very hard on my family,\" he said at a campaign rally in Louisiana, adding that \"impeachment, to me, is a dirty word.\"\n\n\"It's been very unfair, very hard on my family. Me, it's my whole life, it's crazy,\" he said. \"What a life I lead. You think this is fun, don't you? But it's been very hard on my family. Very, very hard.\"\n\nHe did not elaborate on any specific impact.\n\nWhat to expect at Trump's Louisiana rally ahead of runoff election\nNOV. 15, 201906:37\nThe president left Washington \u2014 and sporadic attempts to appear above the impeachment fray \u2014 behind Thursday night, attacking Democrats organizing the public hearings that began this week and the career diplomats testifying in those sessions.\n\n\"This game is already unraveling, you saw it yesterday,\" Trump said during a rally here ahead of the state's gubernatorial runoff vote. \"How about when they asked these two Never-Trumpers \u2018what exactly do you think you impeach him for' and they stood there and went, like, what?\"\n\nTrump's comments came one day after that testimony, and just hours before the Friday appearance of former U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch, who is expected to paint a picture of a politically motivated shadow foreign policy. More testimony is expected next week.\n\nDespite his statement that impeachment had been tough on him personally, the president claimed that Republicans in Congress want to see the process dragged out because they believe it is helping their poll numbers. \"You know what they are doing now? 'Sir, our poll numbers are going through the roof. Could we keep this going?' I said do me a favor, could we get it ended?\" he said.\n\n\"Based on the poll numbers, the people of this country aren't buying it,\" he added.\n\nPublic support for impeachment has changed little in recent weeks, with around 48 percent of Americans favoring impeachment and 44 percent opposing it, according to FiveThirtyEight's impeachment polling tracker.\n\nTrump took a more combative tone Thursday night than he had a day earlier when he tried to appear above the impeachment fray \u2014 claiming he was \"too busy\" to watch the proceedings while he spent much of the day in meetings with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.\n\nBeyond occasional tweetstorms \u2014 consisting mostly of retweets quoting his defenders on Fox News \u2014 Trump had mostly refrained from responding directly to the substance of the hearings.\n\nBut in Louisiana, he accused Democrats of \"ripping our country apart\" and plotting \"a sinister plan.\" He said House Intelligence Committee Chair Adam Schiff, D-Calif., should be indicted for his committee's impeachment investigation.\n\nIn more than five hours of testimony on Wednesday, acting Ambassador to Ukraine Bill Taylor and Deputy Assistant Secretary for European and Eurasian Affairs George Kent painted a picture of a shadow foreign policy run by Trump's personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani. They gave a detailed account of why they thought security funding for Ukraine had been contingent on it launching an investigation into former Vice President Joe Biden and his son Hunter.\n\nTrump and his allies have sought to discredit the witness testimony saying none of them had firsthand knowledge of Trump's thinking on Ukraine since neither had directly spoken to him about it.\n\nTaylor said he was basing most of his testimony off detailed notes he had taken of his conversations with Sondland, who was in direct contact with Trump. Sondland is expected to testify next week.\n\nTaylor said in the hearings that he had been told on several occasions that security assistance to Ukraine wouldn't flow until the country's president committed to a public investigation of the Bidens. He said he was told this by the U.S. Ambassador to the European Union, Gordon Sondland, who was in direct contact with Trump on the issue.\n\nDemocratic lawmakers have been sharpening their messaging on the probe, describing the president's alleged offenses as bribery and extortion, language they think will resonate more strongly with voters than the \"quid pro quo\" charge that dominated the controversy's early weeks.\n\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., said Thursday that the testimony presented evidence of bribery as Democrats seek to sharpen the focus of their impeachment inquiry. Pelosi's comments come amid a Democratic shift in the language used to describe Trump's actions with regard to Ukraine that lie at the heart of the current impeachment inquiry.\n\nTrump was in Louisiana for the third time in five weeks in a bid to help Republicans unseat Democratic Gov. John Bel Edwards. Senior Trump campaign officials have claimed his first trip helped force a runoff in the state's jungle primary, propelling the Republican nominee, Eddie Rispone, into the runoff with Edwards.\n"

        "title": "Assessing the Impeachment Defenses Offered by Trump and his Allies",
        "text": "President Trump and his supporters have tried out a variety of talking points defending his attempts to press the Ukrainian government to open investigations that would benefit him politically.\n\nAs the public phase of the House's impeachment inquiry begins on Wednesday, here are some of the most common rationales Republicans are putting forward to argue Mr. Trump's actions are not impeachable, and how they stack up against the facts.\n\nAttacking the whistle-blower and witnesses\nMr. Trump himself is the most vocal proponent of this shoot-the-messenger defense.\n\nHe has falsely claimed at least two dozen times that the whistle-blower complaint that spurred the impeachment inquiry was \"inaccurate,\" \"false\" or \"a lie.\" In fact, the White House released a reconstructed transcript of the president's phone call with President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine that corroborated much of what the whistle-blower reported. Witness testimony has also backed up and fleshed out the whistle-blower's main points.\n\nMr. Trump has also accused Mark Zaid, a lawyer for the whistle-blower, of planning to \"overthrow\" the president, pointing to a 2017 Twitter post as proof. In the tweet, Mr. Zaid said a \"coup\" had started and impeachment would follow, in reaction to Mr. Trump firing Sally Q. Yates as acting attorney general. (Mr. Zaid told The Times last week that his tweet was taken out of context and that he had also represented the Republican National Committee.)\n\nThe whistle-blower cannot be trusted, according to Mr. Trump, because he or she is a \"strong Democrat.\" While Michael Atkinson, the inspector general for the intelligence community, has said the whistle-blower showed \"arguable political bias\" in favor of a rival candidate, that did not alter Mr. Atkinson's conclusion that the complaint was credible.\n\nMr. Trump has also branded several officials who have testified before Congress as \"Never Trumpers.\" Speaking about Gordon D. Sondland, the United States ambassador to the European Union, who donated $1 million to the president's inauguration committee, Mr. Trump said this month that \"I hardly know the gentleman\" \u2014 despite having called Mr. Sondland \"a really good man and great American\" and \"highly respected\" last month.\n\nClaiming \u2018no quid pro quo'\nFor weeks, Mr. Trump and his allies have aimed to hammer home this simple defense: there was no quid pro quo linking American military aid to Ukraine with investigations the president sought into the son of former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., a leading Democratic presidential candidate, and the conspiracy theory that it was Ukraine, not Russia, that hacked the Democratic National Committee in 2016.\n\nThis talking point was undercut by Mick Mulvaney, Mr. Trump's acting chief of staff, when he acknowledged a tie between the aid and the investigations in an October news conference and then retracted his statement the same day. Democrats have also seized upon four words uttered by Mr. Trump in the White House's reconstructed transcript of the call \u2014 \"do us a favor\" \u2014 to argue that an exchange of benefits was clearly established.\n\nAs an addendum, Mr. Trump has repeatedly cited Mr. Zelensky's denial that he felt pressured as evidence of their \"perfect call.\" William B. Taylor Jr., the top American diplomat in Ukraine, suggested otherwise when he testified to Congress that a national security adviser to Mr. Zelensky told him that the Ukrainian president \"did not want to be used as a pawn in a U.S. re-election campaign.\"\n\nClaiming \u2018no quo'\nThis argument \u2014 that Ukraine had been unaware that military aid had been withheld so it was impossible that Mr. Trump had conditioned its release on Ukraine opening certain investigations \u2014 has been employed by several Republican lawmakers as well as Donald Trump Jr., the president's eldest son, with varying degrees of accuracy.\n\n\"First of all, because nothing was withheld. The other guy on the other side actually said, \u2018I have no idea what you're talking about.' No one knew any aid was even being withheld,\" the younger Mr. Trump said on ABC's \"The View\" last week.\n\n\"The president was pressuring for investigation but there was no quo. The Ukrainian leader did nothing different to actually get the aid,\" Representative Don Bacon of Nebraska said in late October.\n\nRepresentative John Ratcliffe of Texas focused on the timing of the president's call with Mr. Zelensky.\n\n\"Neither Zelensky or any Ukrainian was aware there was a hold on military aid on July 25,\" Mr. Ratcliffe said last month, adding that \"it doesn't matter\" that the Ukrainians learned about it later.\n\nFirst, it's not true that \"nothing was withheld.\" The White House disclosed on July 18 in a secure call with national security officials that it was freezing the aid, and did not release it until Sept. 11, after coming under bipartisan pressure from Congress.\n\nMr. Zelensky may have been unaware that of the aid freeze during the July 25 call, but his top aides had learned that Mr. Trump was seeking the investigations before the phone conversation.\n\nMr. Taylor and two others \u2014 Fiona Hill, Mr. Trump's former top Russia adviser, and Lt. Col. Alexander S. Vindman, the top Ukraine expert on the National Security Council \u2014 have all testified that in a July 10 meeting with top Ukrainian officials, Mr. Sondland said that securing an Oval Office meeting between the two presidents would require a commitment from Ukraine to pursue the investigations.\n\nThe New York Times has reported that some Ukrainian officials had learned of the aid freeze by the first week of August, and the whistle-blower's account said he had heard as of \"early August\" that some Ukrainian officials were aware the aid might be in jeopardy. Mr. Zelensky has said he raised the issue with Vice President Mike Pence in a Sept. 1 meeting. According to Mr. Taylor, Mr. Sondland told a top aide to Mr. Zelensky that the \"security assistance money would not come\" until Kiev committed to pursuing the investigation into Mr. Biden's son. (This was also corroborated by Mr. Sondland.)\n\nIt's also not true that Mr. Zelensky \"did nothing different\" in an attempt to release the aid. He had agreed to appear on CNN on Sept. 13 and announce the investigations Mr. Trump had sought; that ultimately did not happen, but only because the White House released the aid.\n\nDenying that the president had personally directed a quid pro quo\nAllies of Mr. Trump have brushed aside the testimonies of Mr. Taylor and Mr. Sondland as mere speculation, not proof. Their argument is that there is no justification for impeachment \"based on somebody saying they presumed and someone else saying they interpreted,\" Kellyanne Conway, the White House counselor, said last week.\n\n\"Bill Taylor's presumption of the president's involvement or whatever came from a media story,\" Representative Doug Collins, Republican of Georgia, said last Wednesday on Fox News. \"He pointed to Mr. Giuliani, he didn't point to the president.\"\n\nThat media story was a New York Times report in May that detailed efforts by Rudolph W. Giuliani, Mr. Trump's personal lawyer, to press Ukraine into investigating Mr. Biden's son and the theory that origin of the special counsel inquiry into Russia's interference in 2016. Mr. Giuliani told The Times's Kenneth P. Vogel that Mr. Trump supported his actions and \"basically knows what I'm doing, sure, as his lawyer\" \u2014 contradicting the suggestion that Mr. Trump was unaware.\n\n\"Sondland's actions were based on Sondland's assumptions,\" Representative Mike Johnson of Louisiana, said last Wednesday on CNN. \"There are many assumptions about a lot of what he said and that was based on his ideas about what was happening, not necessarily about what the president said.\"\n\nMr. Sondland, in his revised testimony, did say that he \"presumed that the aid suspension had become linked to the proposed anti-corruption statement.\" But he also noted that he believed the Ukrainian president needed to make a public pledge that he was beginning certain investigations before a White House visit would be granted \u2014 a condition, he said, that was communicated by Mr. Giuliani at Mr. Trump's direction.\n\nClaiming Democrats also engaged in quid pro quo\nThe most explicit example of this line of argument comes from Senator Rand Paul, Republican of Kentucky.\n\n\"Menendez tried it. Murphy tried it. Biden tried it. Trump's tried it. They're all doing it. They are all trying to manipulate Ukraine to get some kind of investigation, either to end an investigation or start an investigation,\" Mr. Paul said on Sunday on NBC.\n\nIn May 2018, Senator Robert Menendez of New Jersey and two other Democrats wrote a letter to Yuriy Lutsenko, then Ukraine's prosecutor general, expressing concerns that Mr. Lutsenko's office had frozen investigations related to the special counsel investigation led by Robert S. Mueller III because officials were wary of offending Mr. Trump. The letter made no explicit mention of aid.\n\nSenator Christopher S. Murphy, Democrat of Connecticut, met with Mr. Zelensky in September as part of a bipartisan delegation. The Times reported that Mr. Murphy \"said he urged Mr. Zelensky not to heed the requests from Mr. Giuliani, warning that to do so could threaten bipartisan support for Ukraine in Washington.\" Mr. Murphy later described his comments as a \"common sense\" caution against interfering in the 2020 election.\n\nAs vice president, Mr. Biden had called for the dismissal of Viktor Shokin, who became prosecutor general of Ukraine in 2015, and Mr. Biden threatened to withhold assistance from the United States until Mr. Shokin was pushed out. But Mr. Biden's actions were in line with United States foreign policy as well as the stated positions of Senate Republicans, European Union leaders and the International Monetary Fund, all of whom were calling for Mr. Shokin's ouster.\n\nArguing that quid pro quo is \u2018not an impeachable offense'\nSome Republicans have not gone so far as to completely absolve Mr. Trump, but argue that his actions do not rise to the level of an impeachable offense.\n\n\"I believe that it is inappropriate for a president to ask a foreign leader to investigate a political rival,\" Representative Mac Thornberry of Texas said on Sunday. \"I do not believe it was impeachable.\"\n\n\"I think if you're trying to get information on a political rival to use in a political campaign is not something a president or any official should be doing,\" Representative Will Hurd of Texas said on Fox News Sunday. \"I believe that's something that would make it \u2014 have to truly consider whether impeachment is the right tool or not.\""

        "text": "I can't believe they've actually done it, but the New York Times is going to make me defend Joe Biden with a new ridiculous story about how elitist critics of Elizabeth Warren are \"sexist.\" \n\nThe Times once again has shoehorned a poorly argued opinion story into their news section with this ridiculous headline quote:\n\n\"Biden's attacks on Warren turn personal, drawing some complaints of sexism.\" Obvious questions begin to arise, of course, complaints from whom? What accusations exactly? They go on to explain that Biden's use of the term \"Condescending, angry, or elitist\" is somehow adopting a gendered trope. This is patently insane. Maybe Biden's use of the terms condescending, angry, or elitist come from the fact that Elizabeth Warren is actually quite condescending and elitist.\n\nLuckily I don't need to hash that out. Warren's extraordinarily evident condescension or elitism because friend of the show Zaid Jilani did it very well last week. Let's take a listen:\n\nThe focus here should not just be on Warren's conduct, however, it should be on the paper of record once again being used as an opposition research firm for candidates that share its politics. Remember that headline said complaints of sexism? Well who exactly do those complaints come from. I'll save you the trouble, the first person that they quote is Elizabeth Warren, the next person is an Elizabeth Warren supporter, and then the person after that is also an Elizabeth Warren supporter.\n\nThey didn't even do what they usually do, which is go get quotes from some women's organization that is obviously in the tank for Elizabeth Warren and dress it up as expert analysis. They just quoted the candidate and her supporters. That does sound like strong journalism to you? It sounds like a press release.\n\nElizabeth Warren's pathetic defense and the enlisting of the New York Times to write this ridiculous story should offend all of us. Gaslighting the American public into thinking that all criticism of Elizabeth Warren is sexist does an actual disservice to future events when sexist attacks against her are actually launched against her.\n\nAnd here's the thing.\n\nWarren isn't the only candidate that is pulling this card. Minnesota Senator Amy Klobuchar also basically called sexism on the fact that she and some other female senators have been eclipsed by Mayor Pete Buttigieg on the stage during a CNN interview. Let's take a listen:\n\n This would make a lot more sense if the leading person in the Democratic primary right now was not\u2026.Oh let me check my notes, oh yes one Senator Elizabeth Warren. Or you know, if the Democratic nominee for president last cycle wasn't named\u2026Uh Hillary Rodham Clinton. And you know what maybe Senator Klobuchar? Maybe Pete Buttigieg would be doing a lot worse in the polls if there was a story about him eating a salad with a comb and being one of the most verbally abusive bosses on Capitol Hill. Just a thought.\n\nAlso, I seem to remember a very upstart woman of color and former bartender who beat an incumbent Democratic member of Congress who went on to completely change American political discourse and got more earned media than any other democrat in modern memory. My bet is if she was old enough and could run for president, she'd lap Amy Klobuchar ten times over, what would exactly would she blame then?\n\nYou all I'm sure remember when Klobuchar's opponent and Senate colleague Kamala Harris tried this recently, while blaming voters for being too sexist or too racist to accept her candidacy. What? This should drive us all crazy about these things is the complete denial of a lack of agency for these candidates and lack of general trust in the motivations of the Democratic primary electorate, who I'm going to go ahead and assume here they actually share most of the same gender and racial values these senators purport to have.\n\nAttacking a former law professor in both Warren and Barack Obama's case is not sexist, it's actually pretty accurate. Blaming your failing campaign for sexism or racism when you're a bad candidate is lazy, and it's even worse when it gets lapped up by the mainstream media who are desperate to prove their woke bonafides to all of their friends.\n\nI don't know how many times I have to say it. If you have interesting ideas and you're a good candidate, then you're going to do pretty well in the primary. Amy Klobuchar is not doing well because voters don't trust that she can either A, beat Donald Trump or B, doesn't have a positive vision of the country that aligns with them in a way they would like to see. That's it, that's really all there is too it. Candidates and the media would do well to learn it too if they want to maintain credibility with their voters."

        "text": "President Donald Trump continues to muddle the timeline of events to falsely suggest that the White House release of a memo summarizing his July phone call with the president of Ukraine silenced whistleblowers and contradicted Democratic leaders.\nContrary to Trump's claims:\n\u2022\tThe whistleblower did not \"disappear\" after or because Trump released the memo. The whistleblower has chosen not to reveal his identity, but through his attorney, he has offered to provide written responses to lawmakers' questions.\n\u2022\tThe second whistleblower did not \"disappear\" after release of the memo, either. The second whistleblower did not step forward until after the memo was released.\n\u2022\tThere's no evidence House Speaker Nancy Pelosi was \"angry as hell\" that the memo did not match the whistleblower's account. In fact, the memo corroborates the main points of the complaint. After the memo's release, Pelosi said it \"confirms that the President engaged in behavior that undermines the integrity of our elections.\"\n\u2022\tRep. Adam Schiff's dramatic, and embellished, reading of the July 25 conversation was not exposed by the release of the memo. Although Trump claimed he \"caught\" a \"very embarrassed\" Schiff in a lie when the White House \"released the transcript,\" the memo was actually made public a day before Schiff's recounting of it.\nThe whistleblower complaint was filed on Aug. 12. However, the first rough outlines of the complaint only began to trickle out publicly in mid-September, beginning with an anonymously sourced story in the Washington Post on Sept. 18. Several days later, the Wall Street Journal, again citing anonymous sources, reported that Trump \"in a July phone call repeatedly pressured the president of Ukraine to investigate Joe Biden's son,\" and urged President Volodymyr Zelensky to \"work with Rudy Giuliani on a probe that could hamper Mr. Trump's potential 2020 opponent.\"\nHere's the order of events that happened next over three days in late September.\nOn Sept. 24, Pelosi announced that the House would begin an impeachment inquiry.\nOn Sept. 25, the White House released a memo of the call, which confirmed that Trump asked Zelensky to investigate the Bidens. The memo isn't a verbatim transcript, but rather the notes taken by assigned staff.\nOn Sept. 26, the House intelligence committee released a redacted copy of the whistleblower complaint.\nIn his repeated retelling of events, however, Trump falsely claims that the White House release of the memo silenced the complaints, or contradicted them.\nTrump, to reporters, Nov. 4: I think that the whistleblower gave a lot of false information. And you have to see who the whistleblower is. Once I released the transcript, which was almost immediately, the whistleblower's report was very wrong, because as you know, the whistleblower covered mostly my transcript \u2014 my call \u2014 my call with the president of Ukraine. So once I released that call \u2014 I released a very detailed version of that call \u2014 all of a sudden, the whistleblower's report was incorrect. And the whistleblower seems to have disappeared. And I also wonder what happened to the second whistleblower. And what happened to the informant. They all disappeared once I released the report.\nTrump, at a rally in Monroe, Louisiana, Nov. 6: You know the whistleblower? The one that came out with this \"Trump said this and Trump said that.\" And then when they heard my real phone call the whistleblower disappeared. Shifty Schiff, he's a corrupt politician. Schiff didn't want to have the whistleblower anymore because nobody thought I was going to release the phone call. \u2026 But the whistleblower, before they knew I was going to release, he came out with a whistleblower, you know, like he's some wonderful person. Take a look at the whistleblower. But the whistleblower came out with his horrible statement about this call, so I really had no choice. I said immediately \u2014 talk about transparency. I said, \"Release it, Release it immediately.\" And then, the whistleblower saw it and shifty Schiff saw it, he's a total crook. Schiff saw it. Pelosi saw it, and they said, we've got a problem. We don't want to have anything to do with the whistleblower anymore and the whistleblower disappeared. You know who else disappeared? The second whistleblower. And you know who else disappeared? The informer to the whistleblower if there was such a person, which I doubt, which I doubt.\nTrump, in a tweet, Nov. 4: The Whistleblower gave false information & dealt with corrupt politician Schiff. He must be brought forward to testify. Written answers not acceptable! Where is the 2nd Whistleblower? He disappeared after I released the transcript. Does he even exist? Where is the informant? Con!\nTrump, in an interview with WKYT-TV in Lexington, Nov. 4: And I think the whistleblower is very suspect, because \u2026 what he wrote is very wrong, and I released the conversation. And when we released the conversation the whistleblower \u2014 he disappeared. Everybody sort of disappeared after I did that.\nTrump packs a lot of misinformation into those statements.\nMemo Backed Up Whistleblower Complaint\nFor starters, it's not true that the memo of the call showed the whistleblower complaint to be \"false\" and \"totally wrong,\" as Trump has repeatedly claimed. As we have written, the whistleblower's account of the July phone call largely matches up with the White House-released memo.\nSpecifically, the whistleblower made these three claims that were corroborated by the memo: Trump asked Zelensky to \"initiate or continue an investigation\" into former Vice President Joe Biden and his son, Hunter Biden; assist the U.S. in investigating allegations that \"Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential election originated in Ukraine\"; and \"meet or speak\" about these matters with Trump's personal attorney, Rudy Giuliani, and Attorney General William Barr.\nAt a House intelligence committee hearing on Sept. 26, Acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire testified that the whistleblower's complaint \"is in alignment with what was released yesterday by the president.\"\nWhistleblowers Didn't \u2018Disappear'\nContrary to Trump's claims, the whistleblower did not \"disappear\" after the release of the memo. From the beginning, the whistleblower has resisted being unmasked, and federal law states that the identity of a whistleblower cannot be disclosed without their consent. In an Oct. 25 op-ed for the Washington Post, the whistleblower's attorneys argued that \"the identity of the whistleblower is irrelevant.\"\n\"Much of what has been disclosed since the release of our client's complaint actually exceeds the whistleblower's knowledge of what transpired at the time the complaint was submitted,\" Andrew P. Bakaj and Mark S. Zaid wrote. That includes release of the summarized transcript of the call, text messages provided to the House of Representatives by the former U.S. special representative for Ukraine, and congressional testimony from numerous government officials involved in the activities highlighted by the whistleblower. \"Because our client has no additional information about the president's call, there is no justification for exposing their identity and all the risks that would follow.\"\nBut the whistleblower has not \"disappeared.\" The whistleblower's attorneys nixed the idea of him testifying privately in person before Congress, or perhaps remotely with his identity protected. But the lawyers for the whistleblower have notified both the House and Senate intelligence committees that the whistleblower is willing to respond in writing to questions and under oath.\nAs for the second whistleblower \"disappearing\" after the White House release of the phone call memo, that doesn't jibe with the timeline.\nThe second whistleblower, who works in the intelligence community, did not come forward until the first week of October, more than a week after the White House released its memo. Zaid, one of the attorneys representing the original whistleblower, told ABC News Chief Anchor George Stephanopoulos on Oct. 6 that he was now representing a second whistleblower.\nZaid said the second whistleblower had not filed a complaint but had spoken to the intelligence community's inspector general and that the person had \"first hand knowledge that supported the first whistleblower.\" Zaid tweeted that his client \"made a protected disclosure under the law and cannot be retaliated against.\" According to the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, \"Whistleblowing can range from a simple conversation with a supervisor, to contacting an Inspector General (IG) Hotline, to providing information, through the proper channels, to Congress. In each instance of lawful whistleblowing, an individual is getting the right information to the right people.\"\nEven more absurd is Trump's claim that the \"informer to the whistleblower if there was such a person, which I doubt\" has also disappeared since release of the memo. The original whistleblower, described by the New York Times as a CIA officer who was detailed to the National Security Council, wrote in his complaint that while he did not participate in Trump's phone call with the Ukrainian president, \"in the course of official interagency business\" he was informed about details of the phone call by \"multiple White House officials with direct knowledge of the call.\"\nAs we wrote when Trump made similar claims, given that the original whistleblower did not participate directly in the Ukraine phone call, and yet got key details about it correct, it stands to reason he was provided that information by an informant.\nMore important, numerous government officials have now testified before House committees about the phone call and other aspects of the whistleblower's complaint, and have confirmed its key points. (See \"The Whistleblower Complaint Timeline\" for more information.)\nSchiff \u2018Parody' Came After the Memo Release\nTrump also has altered the timeline regarding a rendition of the phone call that Schiff, the chairman of the House intelligence committee, gave prior to the Sept. 26 testimony of Acting Director of National Intelligence Maguire. Although Trump claims Schiff was \"embarrassed\" by the subsequent release of the phone call memo, the memo was released a day before Schiff's remarks at the beginning of the House hearing.\nTrump, at Values Voter Summit, Oct. 12: This crooked Adam Schiff made a statement \u2014 long, beautiful statement \u2014 and it was a fraud. He repeated my call, but it wasn't me. He made it so bad. \u2026 But then I did something that they didn't expect. I immediately called up Ukraine, through my representatives. \u2026 I got approval to immediately make that call public. \u2026 I heard it [Schiff's version], I said, \"That's not what I said.\" He made up a conversation. And it was vicious what he said. And then we caught him. \u2026 By the way, [Schiff] only did it because he never thought that I was going to release the transcript. \u2026 He did it and then I released the transcript. They never thought in a million years, even in terms of violation with another country, but we got the approval. So, he's very embarrassed.\nTrump, at a rally in Lexington, Kentucky, Nov. 4: How about Schiff? He makes up a conversation. He gets up before the United States Congress. He repeats my conversation with the head of the Ukraine, the new president, a good guy, repeats it. I said, \"I never said that.\" He made a horrible statement. It was a total lie, and then, I actually went and released the actual conversation, and you haven't heard about the whistleblower after that. Have you?\nAs we said, Trump gets the order backward. At the Sept. 26 House intelligence committee hearing, Schiff presented a dramatic retelling of Trump's phone call with Zelensky that Schiff said was partly \"in parody.\" As we have previously written, Schiff said he was recounting \"the essence of what the president communicates\" in his call with Zelensky \"in not so many words.\"\nSome of what Schiff said was similar to the White House's memo of the phone call. But Schiff also embellished the conversation, claiming, for example, that Trump told Zelensky, \"you better listen good. I want you to make up dirt on my political opponent.\" Trump never said anything about making up dirt, according to the White House memo on the July 25 phone call. As we've written before, we'll leave it for readers to judge whether it was immediately clear that Schiff was purposefully giving his own dramatic representation that didn't completely square with the facts.\nHowever, Schiff wasn't surprised and \"embarrassed\" by the release of the memo of the call, because, as Trump claimed, Schiff \"never thought that I was going to release the transcript.\" Indeed, the memo had been publicly released by the White House the day before, on Sept. 25.\nNo Evidence Pelosi \u2018Angry' Due to Memo\nTrump also falsely characterized Pelosi's reaction to the White House-released memo.\nFor example, at a rally in Lake Charles, Louisiana, on Oct. 11, Trump said: \"Nancy Pelosi said, \u2018Well, that's what he said. Isn't it?' But she was angry as hell when she got to read the transcript. Because she said, \u2018Wait a minute, that's not what I was told.' But she was stuck, she was stuck.\"\nAt another rally in Louisiana on Nov. 6, Trump said that when Pelosi read the White House memo of the call, she said, \"We've got a problem.\"\nPelosi did announce that the House would begin an impeachment inquiry the day before the White House released the phone call memo, and two days before the public release of a redacted copy of the whistleblower's complaint.\nBut on the day the White House memo of the call was released, Pelosi did not express concerns that she had misrepresented Trump's actions in calling for the impeachment inquiry. Rather, in a released statement, she said, \"The release of the notes of the call by the White House confirms that the President engaged in behavior that undermines the integrity of our elections, the dignity of the office he holds and our national security.\"\n\"Either the President does not know the weight of his words or he does not care about ethics or his constitutional responsibilities,\" Pelosi stated. \"The transcript and the Justice Department's acting in a rogue fashion in being complicit in the President's lawlessness confirm the need for an impeachment inquiry. Clearly, the Congress must act.\"\n"

        "title": "AP FACT CHECK: GOP presses empty Ukraine meddling theory",
        "text": "Congressional Republicans pressed the discredited theory that Ukraine meddled in the 2016 U.S. election in defending President Donald Trump in Wednesday's impeachment hearings.\n\nA look at [some of the remarks](https://apnews.com/Trumpimpeachmentinquiry) in the House Intelligence Committee proceeding:\n\n___\n\nREP. DEVIN NUNES, top Republican on the panel: \"The Democrats cooperated in Ukrainian election meddling. ... Officials showed a surprising lack of interest in the indications of Ukrainian election meddling that deeply concerned the president at whose pleasure they serve.\"\n\nTHE FACTS: The theory that Ukrainians interfered in the U.S. election and that Democrats cooperated in that effort is unsubstantiated. If U.S. officials showed a lack of interest in pursuing the matter, it's because they considered it \"fiction,\" as one put it.\n\nTrump himself was told by his officials that the theory was \"completely debunked\" long before the president pressed Ukraine to investigate it anyway, according to Tom Bossert, Trump's first homeland security adviser. And in testimony at the closed-door hearings that preceded Wednesday's public session, Fiona Hill, former special assistant to Trump on the National Security Council, said it was bogus.\n\n\"It is a fiction that the Ukrainian government was launching an effort to upend our election,\" Hill testified. \"I'm extremely concerned that this is a rabbit hole that we're all going to go down in between now and the 2020 election, and it will be to all of our detriment.\"\n\nBroadly, the theory contends that a hack of the Democratic National Committee in 2016 was a setup designed to cast blame on Russia but actually cooked up by or with the help of Ukrainians. But the evidence points conclusively to Russia, not Ukraine.\n\nBased on a security firm's findings that Russian agents had broken into the Democrats' network and stolen emails, special counsel Robert Mueller indicted 12 members of Russia's military intelligence agency and concluded that their operation sought to help Trump's candidacy, not Hillary Clinton's, as the conspiracy theorists and Trump have it.\n\n___\n\nREP. ADAM SCHIFF, committee chairman, responding to Nunes' claim that the Democrat knows the identity of the whistleblower and his staff has spoken with that official: \"That's a false statement. I do not know the identity of the whistleblower.\"\n\nTHE FACTS: Nunes is correct about one part of that statement: Schiff's staff has been in touch with the whistleblower.\n\nSchiff may not know the whistleblower's identity himself, but someone on his committee staff very well could.\n\nSchiff wrongly stated in September that his committee had not communicated with the whistleblower before that official's complaint was filed.\n\nIn fact, Schiff spokesman Patrick Boland said the whistleblower contacted the committee for guidance, speaking to an aide who counseled the official to contact the inspector general and get his own counsel.\n\n___\n\nREP. JIM JORDAN, Ohio Republican, on why the hold on military aid to Ukraine doesn't amount to a quid pro quo: Ukrainian President Volodymyr \"Zelenskiy had to commit to an investigation of the Bidens before the aid got released. And the aid got released, and he didn't commit to an investigation.\"\n\nTHE FACTS: It's true that the aid was released without Trump's demand for a Ukrainian probe of former Vice President Joe Biden and his son Hunter being met. But Jordan and other Republicans who made this point ignored a key detail about the failure of the this-for-that deal to be consummated: The administration got caught holding up the aid to Ukraine.\n\nAccording to the hearing, the aid that Congress had approved months earlier and Trump had frozen was finally freed Sept. 11.\n\nThat was days after congressional committees had begun looking into the matter, aware that the assistance had been sidelined and that a whistleblower had a complaint in motion.\n\nThe fact that this episode was coming to light also got Zelenskiy off the hook from having to decide between announcing the investigation Trump wanted or defying the U.S. president.\n\nAccording to testimony to the committee, Zelenskiy was planning to go on CNN to announce the probe \u2014 satisfying Trump's wish to have him commit to one publicly \u2014 when the disclosure of the pressure campaign by Trump and his underlings relieved him of that need.\n\n___\n\nNUNES: \"The whistleblower was acknowledged to have a bias against President Trump.\"\n\nTHE FACTS: That may or may not be so. Whatever the whistleblower's political beliefs, though, that official's complaint was deemed credible by the inspector general who received it.\n\nMoreover, the July 25 phone conversation described by the whistleblower closely tracked the account later released by the White House.\n\nIt was during that call that Trump pressed Zelenskiy to investigate Democrats, along with Biden and his son, as a \"favor.\"\n\n___\n\nNUNES, on the Trump administration's military aid to Ukraine: \"This was a very strong message that Americans are willing to provide more than blankets. This was the Obama administration's approach.\"\n\nTHE FACTS: He's exaggerating.\n\nWhile the Obama administration [refused](https://apnews.com/01513aa090fc40ceb388734f22e4c7b0) to provide Ukraine with lethal weapons in 2014 to fight Russian-backed separatists, it offered a range of other military and security aid \u2014 not just \"blankets.\"\n\nBy March 2015, the Obama administration had [provided](https://www.dsca.mil/news-media/news-archive/first-us-armored-hmmwvs-arrive-ukraine-greeted-president-poroshenko) more than $120 million in security aid for Ukraine and promised $75 million worth of equipment, including counter-mortar radars, night vision devices and medical supplies, according to the Defense Department. The U.S. also pledged 230 Humvee vehicles.\n\nThe U.S. aid offer came after Russian President Vladimir Putin in 2014 annexed Crimea and provided support for separatists in eastern cities near Russia's border.\n\nUltimately between 2014 and 2016, the Obama administration [committed](https://fas.org/sgp/crs/row/R45008.pdf) more than $600 million in security aid to Ukraine.\n\nIn the last year of the Obama administration, the U.S. established the Ukraine Security Assistance Initiative, which provided U.S. military equipment and training to help defend Ukraine against Russian aggression. From 2016 to 2019, Congress appropriated $850 million for this initiative.\n\nThe Trump administration in 2017 agreed to provide lethal aid to Ukraine, later committing to [sell](https://www.dsca.mil/major-arms-sales/ukraine-javelin-missiles-and-command-launch-units) $47 million in Javelin anti-tank missiles.\n\n___\n\nWHITE HOUSE: \"Don't rely on second, third, and fourth-hand accounts. Read the transcript for yourself.\" \u2014 tweet Wednesday.\n\nNUNES: \"Officials' alarm at the president's actions was typically based on second-hand, third-hand, and even fourth-hand rumors and innuendo.\"\n\nSTEPHANIE GRISHAM, White House press secretary: \"Dems star witnesses can't provide any first hand knowledge.\" \u2014 tweet Wednesday.\n\nTHE FACTS: The White House and GOP allies are incorrect in suggesting the impeachment inquiry is based purely on secondhand and thirdhand information.\n\nIt is true that William Taylor, the highest-ranking U.S. official in Ukraine who testified Wednesday, was not on the call at the center of the whistleblower complaint and that his account relies in great part on what he learned from other witnesses. Even the most sensational aspect of his testimony \u2014 that Trump spoke with Gordon Sondland, U.S. ambassador to the EU, about investigations into Democrat Joe Biden one day after his call with Zelenskiy \u2014 was based on what he learned from staff.\n\nBut key elements of his account have been subsequently confirmed by Sondland, including in an addendum Sondland filed last week. In addition, text messages of Taylor's discussions with Sondland and Kurt Volker, another envoy, lay out the contours of a quid pro quo.\n\nBoth Sondland and Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman, a top Trump national security adviser who listened in on Trump's call, are scheduled to testify next week.\n\nMeanwhile, the White House has sought to prevent those closer to Trump from appearing before the House committee, including acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney and former national security adviser John Bolton.\n\nMore broadly, the rough transcript of the July 25 phone call between Trump and Ukraine's leader does not clear Trump. It is largely in sync with the whistleblower's complaint and the words of a succession of career civil servants and Trump political appointees brought before Congress.\n\nTogether they stitched an account that shows Trump pressing for a political favor from a foreign leader and, as key testimony has it, conditioning military aid on getting what he wanted."

        "text": "USA TODAY has obtained a copy of \"A Warning,\" a book written by a self-described senior official in the Trump administration. The author paints a scathing portrait of a president and administration in chaos. The White House has denounced the book as a work of fiction, with press secretary Stephanie Grisham saying, \"the coward who wrote this book didn't put their name on it because it is nothing but lies.\"\n\nSome key excerpts:\n\nOn the transition to the White House\n\n\"Advisors brandished their knives, back-stabbing each other to get the jobs they wanted.\n\nAt the same time, a parade of job-seekers made the pilgrimage to Trump Tower in New York to pay homage to the incoming commander in chief, seeking a place on his short list. Most had conveniently changed their minds about the president-elect. Factions formed. Conspiracies to undermine potential candidates ?while boosting others ?were hatched and dissolved, sometimes in the same day. There was the Kushner camp, the\n\nBannon camp, the Conway camp, and others such as Penceland or the so-called Flynn-stones, acolytes of the anointed national security advisor. They were united at times and divided at others. This was a real-life version of 'The Apprentice.' \"\n\n'Anonymous' author::Trump 'will not exit quietly,' even if defeated or impeached\n\nOn the courts\n\n\"The president has proposed doing away with judges on more than one occasion. Too many of his policies are getting stuck in legal limbo, he says. \u893ban we just get rid of the judges? Let\u8ab7 get rid of the f---ing judges,?Trump fumed one morning. \u894ehere shouldn\u8ab8 be any at all, really.?He went a step further and asked his legal team to draft up a bill and send it to Congress to reduce the number of federal judges. Staff ignored the outburst and the wacky request.\"\n\nOn shooting migrants\n\n\"In fact, it was Trump himself the previous year who suggested shooting immigrants found crossing the border. Yes, shooting them, real human beings, with bullets from guns held by members of our armed forces. 'They are throwing rocks viciously and violently,' he said, discussing an incoming caravan of people, most of whom were fleeing poverty. They\u8aa8 been on the march for weeks and had gotten past Mexican authorities. 'We are not going to put up with that. If they want to throw rocks at our military, our military fights back. I told them to consider it a rifle. When they throw rocks like they did at the Mexico military and police, I say consider it a rifle.'\n\nOn Russian President Vladimir Putin\n\n\"The president\u8ab7 obvious admiration for Vladimir Putin ('great guy,' 'terrific person') still continues to puzzle us, including those on the team who shrug off his outlandish behavior. Where did the Putin hero worship come from? It\u8ab7 almost as if Trump is the scrawny kid trying to suck up to the bully on the playground. Commentators have speculated, without any evidence, that Moscow must 'have something' on the president. I wish I could say. All I know is that whatever drives his love for Putin, it\u8ab7 terrible for the United States because Vladimir is not on our side and no US president should be building him up.\"\n\nOn Trump son-in-law Jared Kushner\n\n\"Jared is a likable person, a youthful and energetic advisor and an empathetic listener. However, when the secretary of defense is cut out of Jared\u8ab7 meetings regarding a crucial part of the world, or the national security advisor isn\u8ab8 back-briefed on an important conversation Kushner has with a foreign ambassador, it can cause problems, sometimes big problems. It isn\u8ab8 clear the president is satisfied that so many issues run through his son-in-law\u8ab7 office, but the arrangement persists because Jared is careful to always demonstrate loyalty to his wife\u8ab7 father, even at the expense of his standing among other top officials. Thus, the unclear and unhealthy lanes of authority persist.\" \n\nOn Hillary Clinton\n\n\"Trump remains fixated on his previous presidential rival years into his tenure, continuously disparaging and demeaning her. It might be a different situation if he expected to face off again with Hillary Clinton, yet she appears to be finished with public office. Don\u8ab8 get me wrong. No one in the Trump White House is a fan of Hillary Clinton, but we started to find the president\u8ab7 chronic animosity toward her to be a little weird. He has tweeted about Clinton hundreds of times since taking office. He has even flirted with using the powers of his office to investigate and prosecute her. ... Electoral defeat is not enough; Donald Trump wants total defeat of his opponents.\""

        "title": "On final day of fall session, Illinois lawmakers propose new disclosures for lobbyists, public officials",
        "text": "The Illinois legislature on Thursday approved what lawmakers on both sides of the aisle described as a small step toward fixing the state's governmentethics laws amid an ongoing federal public corruption probe that has ensnared politicians from Chicago City Hall to the Capitol in Springfield.\n\nWith bipartisan votes in both chambers, lawmakers approved a measure that would require state lobbyists to disclose more information to the public and create a combined online database for information on lobbyists, campaign contributions and public officials' annual statements of economic interest. A companion measure lawmakers also approved would create a 16-member commission to recommend additional changes to ethics laws.\n\n\"We need to do it in a thoughtful, systematic and comprehensive way,\" House Democratic leader Greg Harris of Chicago said.\n\nThe proposal from Democrats came on the final day of the General Assembly's fall veto session, which began in late October as then-state Rep. Luis Arroyo was being charged in federal court in Chicago with bribing a state senator to support sweepstakes gambling legislation that would have benefited one of Arroyo's City Hall lobbying clients.\n\nGov. J.B. Pritzker, who called for lawmakers to take up ethics legislation this week following the criminal charge against Arroyo, praised the measures as an important first step.\n\n\"It's just a beginning,\" Pritzker said Thursday at an unrelated news conference. \"Because we're here, we have three days of veto session, there isn't a lot of time to go after the big things that need to be addressed and that I'm insisting be addressed.\"\n\nAmong other changes, the measure would require state lobbyists to disclose any unit of local government that they lobby and any elected or appointed office they hold.\n\nBut even before the legislation came to the House floor for a final vote, Democrats removed a provision that would have required lawmakers and other public officials to disclose more information about their personal financial interests.\n\nHarris said the change was in response to objections from Republicans, who felt the new disclosure requirements didn't go far enough, as well as concerns House Democrats raised in a closed-door caucus meeting. What officials should have to disclose about their personal finances is one of many issues the new commission will study, he said.\n\nRepublican Rep. Grant Wehrli of Naperville said it was \"disingenuous\" to say Republicans wanted that part of the measure removed.\n\n\"I would just like it to be clear that you're not making these changes to benefit this side of the aisle,\" Wehrli said. \"These changes came out of your caucus.\"\n\nRepublicans also criticized Democrats over lack of action on numerous ethics proposals they've filed, including one that would ban lawmakers from lobbying at the local level, as Arroyo has done.\n\nRep. Margo McDermed, a Mokena Republican, called the measures approved Thursday, \"wallpapering of a big, ugly, festering wound on the state of Illinois.\"\n\n\"This is just one more kick-the-can-down-the-road effort of this General Assembly,\" said McDemerd, who nonetheless voted in favor of both proposals.\n\nSign up for The Spin to get the top stories in politics delivered to your inbox weekday afternoons.\n\nWhile banning lawmakers from lobbying local governments or requiring disclosure of that activity sounds simple, Harris said, there is \"not a single definition of what lobbying means, nor is there consistent registration among localities or municipalities.\"\n\nHe said the commission should come up with a uniform definition of lobbying and who is required to register as a lobbyist at the state and local level so that \"people cannot go outside the four corners of the page and find any way not to disclose themselves.\"\n\nHouse and Senate Republicans also raised objections about the composition of the ethics commission, arguing that appointments by Attorney General Kwame Raoul and Secretary of State Jesse White \u2014 both Chicago Democrats \u2014 would skew the partisan balance.\n\nIn response to those criticisms, the final measure requires Raoul and White to name the inspectors general from their offices as one of their two appointments. Pritzker, who gets four appointments to the commission, could name up to four Republicans but only two Democrats.\n\nThat wasn't enough to appease Senate Republicans, none of whom voted in favor of the measure creating the commission.\n\nRepublican leader Bill Brady of Bloomington said it would create an \"unbalanced, partisan commission.\"\n\n\"That's what the people will see, and that will disgust them,\" Brady said.\n\nWhile the lobbying provisions approved Thursday don't address the issues brought to light by Arroyo's arrest, another branch of the ongoing federal investigation is digging into the lobbying practices of ComEd and its parent company, Exelon. The utility giant has a long history of hiring former state lawmakers and staffers of House Speaker Michael Madigan.\n\nFederal authorities are scrutinizing whether ComEd and Exelon hired politically connected lobbyists to curry favor with lawmakers to support favorable legislation, including electric rate increases.\n\nThe Chicago Tribune reported this week that the FBI recorded phone calls of Michael McClain, a former lawmaker, close confidant of Madigan and ComEd lobbyist who retired in 2016. Federal authorities raided McClain's Quincy home in May, sources have said.\n\nAround the same time, agents raided the home of former Chicago Ald. Mike Zalewski and former Madigan political operative Kevin Quinn, the brother of 13th Ward Ald. Marty Quinn. Authorities were seeking records related to efforts to get Zalewski lobbying work for ComEd after he retired last year, according to a law enforcement source.\n\nAuthorities also are looking into checks written to Kevin Quinn by current and former ComEd lobbyists after he resigned from Madigan's political organization in the wake of sexual harassment allegations.\n\nFederal agents also sought records related to ComEd and four unnamed Exelon officials \u2014 among a host of other materials \u2014 during a September raid on the Capitol office of state Sen. Martin Sandoval, according to a search warrant. The Chicago Democrat's daughter, Angie Sandoval, works for ComEd."

Democrats have already heard this week\u8ab7 witnesses testify for hours privately; now they\u8ab6e taking those stories to the televised world in hopes of captivating viewers and bringing voter sentiment behind the notion that Trump abused his power and should become just the third president in the country\u8ab7 history to be impeached.\n\n\u893dven though we don\u8ab8 anticipate additional information beyond ?what we have already made public, there is a real value in hearing directly from the witnesses so the American people can hear it from their mouths and firsthand,?said a Democratic aide working on the inquiry.\n\nRep.

Only a sharp shift in public backing for impeachment is likely to sway Trump\u8ab7 Republican defenders in the Senate, where a two-thirds majority is needed to remove a sitting president. And GOP leaders have dug in to back their ally in the White House: Not one House Republican voted to back an impeachment inquiry last month.\n\nBut the stakes are also high for Trump and Republicans, who are seeking to defend the president\u8ab7 conduct amid mounting evidence that he enlisted a foreign leader to find dirt on a political opponent amid his bid for reelection. And GOP leaders in both the White House and the Capitol on Tuesday were bracing for the public fight. \n\nA new CBS poll released Tuesday indicates both sides face a divided electorate as they seek to capture the public\u8ab7 favor, finding that 56 percent of voters feel Trump has handled the impeachment process poorly, while 52 percent think Democrats have done the same.\n\nFor Democrats, there are potential perils in taking the investigation live. Over the summer, in the midst of their probe into Russia\u8ab7 2016 election interference, they compelled the public testimony of former special counsel Robert Mueller, whose shaky, stoic delivery changed few minds in the general public ?and none on Capitol Hill. More recently, Democrats brought in Corey Lewandowski, Trump\u8ab7 former campaign manager, in a hearing that quickly devolved into a partisan shouting match.\n\nHouse Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff\u8ab7 (D-Calif.) challenge is to steer the Ukraine hearings toward something in between ?to draw out a compelling narrative without allowing the proceedings to degenerate into a spectacle of acrimony and partisan grandstanding.\n\nWith that in mind, Democrats seem to be bracing for political shenanigans.\n\nSchiff, for one, has acknowledged that \u8971he temptation to turn this solemn process into a political circus?might be \u8965rresistible.?He\u8ab7 urging lawmakers in both parties to tone it down and focus on the substance of the investigation.\n\n{mossecondads}\u8942 hope that all Members will approach these proceedings with the seriousness of purpose and love of country that they demand,?he wrote Tuesday in a \u893cear Colleague?letter.\n\nStill, Republicans are also gearing up for the open hearings, holding closed-door practice sessions as they strategize how best to counter Democrats?accusations that Trump conducted a shadow foreign policy at the expense of national security.\n\nIn a memo sent from Republican staff to GOP members Tuesday morning, Republicans argue that the \u8961vidence gathered does not establish an impeachable offense.?\nIn particular, Republicans plan to swat down Democrats?claims that Trump and his personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani sought to press Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to open two politically motivated investigations that would benefit him heading into 2020.\n\nAllegations that Trump used nearly $400 million in aid as leverage to press Zelensky to open a corruption probe into his top 2020 political rival, former Vice President Joe Biden, is at the heart of the inquiry that threatens to topple Trump\u8ab7 presidency.\n\nRepublicans contend that because Ukraine did not know the aid was being withheld until very late in the negotiations, there could not be a quid pro quo. Still, some witnesses have testified that Kyiv knew much earlier than Trump\u8ab7 allies have said.\n\n\u894aresident Zelensky and President Trump have both said there was no pressure on the call; The Ukrainian government was not aware of a hold on U.S. security assistance at the time of the July 25 call; and President Trump met with President Zelensky and U.S. security assistance flowed to Ukraine in September 2019 ?both of which occurred without Ukraine investigating President Trump\u8ab7 political rivals,?according to the GOP staff memo circulated Tuesday morning.\n\nDemocrats have lined up two high-level State Department officials to appear as witnesses on Wednesday, including the top U.S. diplomat to Ukraine, William Taylor, who had testified last month that Trump\u8ab7 dealings with Zelensky amounted to a \u895dlear?quid pro quo.\n\n\u894decurity assistance money would not come until the President committed to pursue the investigation,?said Taylor, who testified during his closed-door deposition \u8971hat was my clear understanding.?\nDemocrats hope Taylor\u8ab7 years in foreign service will lend credibility to his claims about the president\u8ab7 Ukraine policy.\n\nBut Republicans have sought to undermine Taylor by claiming that he lacked firsthand knowledge of key events, a GOP talking point that has been hammered by the White House and the president\u8ab7 defenders as they seek to undercut witness testimonies.\n\n\u894ehe one thing we know is Bill Taylor never ever talked with the president. There were all kinds of important meetings that he wasn\u8ab8 present at, but he got information second-, third-hand so the American people can judge that for themselves tomorrow,?said Rep. Jim Jordan (R-Ohio), a close ally of the president.\n\n\u894ehe facts are on the president\u8ab7 side, the truth is on the president\u8ab7 side,?added Jordan, who was temporarily moved to the House Intelligence Committee to defend the president during the impeachment hearings.\n\nBut Democrats say they\u8abae pulled in testimony from a range of witnesses who have different levels of contact with the president.\n\nWednesday\u8ab7 second witness is George Kent, a senior State Department official, who will sit alongside Taylor before the committee. He had previously painted a bleak portrait of Giuliani\u8ab7 activities in Ukraine, saying the president\u8ab7 personal lawyer carried out a \u895dampaign of lies?in order to oust U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch, according to a transcript of his testimony.\n\n\u8947r. Giuliani, at that point, had been carrying on a campaign for several months full of lies and incorrect information about Ambassador Yovanovitch, so this was a continuation of his campaign of lies,?Kent testified on Oct. 15, according to his now-public transcript.\n\nWhile Wednesday will be Democrats?first opportunity to create a strong impression with the American people, the House Intelligence Committee has other public hearings in the works that can back up the testimony given by Kent and Taylor.\n\nOn Friday, Yovanovitch is slated to testify publicly about the shadowy campaign to oust her, led by Giuliani, corrupt Ukrainian representatives and disreputable media figures.\n\nIt remains unclear how long the public hearing phase of the Democrats?investigation will last. Schiff, in his \u893cear Colleague?letter, said that \u895bdditional witnesses will be announced this week.?He did not say who will appear ?or when.\n\nAmid the media\u8ab7 clamor for new information, Democrats are revealing just one thing: They intend to be persistent.\n\n\u8953ou should just expect that we\u8ab0l continue to make news every day,?said the Democratic aide. \u894do don\u8ab8 ask us what\u8ab7 on tap. Just know something\u8ab7 on tap.?,https://thehill.com/policy/national-security/470184-democrats-face-make-or-break-moment-on-impeachment/,,_x000D_\nN59042,1,Testimony in Stone trial suggests Donald Trump lied to Mueller,MSNBC,Chuck Rosenberg"

        "text": "The House impeachment inquiry begins public hearings Wednesday after weeks of closed-door depositions investigating President Donald Trump's dealings with Ukraine.\n\nMuch of the evidence gathering occurred behind closed doors, as three key committees gathered depositions from State Department and National Security Council officials. But now the entire House \u2013 and the country \u2013 will be able to watch as testimony unfolds.\n\nDemocrats suggest that Trump's demand that Ukraine investigate his rival while withholding nearly $400 million in military aid could warrant impeachment. During a July 25 call, Trump urged Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden, and his son, Hunter, who served on the board of Ukrainian energy company Burisma Holdings. But Trump has dismissed the investigation as a partisan \"witch hunt\" and said he was justified in fighting corruption in Ukraine.\n\nThe hearings will educate the American public about what happened in anticipation of a possible House vote on whether to impeach Trump. If the House adopts articles of impeachment, the Senate would hold a trial on whether to remove the president from office.\n\n\"In my view, the public hearings have the potential for significant impact,\" said John Marston, a former federal prosecutor now in private practice at Foley Hoag LLP. \"If the case is made clearly and with compelling evidence in the hearings, that can move the needle in the public, and that is what will drive the views of congress. So public hearings have the potential for significant, even determinative, impact as this moves forward.\"\n\nMovie nights, phone calls:How Trump is uniting the GOP to fight impeachment\n\nTwo witnesses are scheduled Wednesday. Bill Taylor, the top U.S. diplomat in Ukraine, who told lawmakers about gradually learning about demands for investigations, first as a condition for a meeting between Trump and Zelensky and then as a condition to receive military aid. George Kent, a deputy assistant secretary of State, raised concerns about Giuliani steering policy privately. The witness Friday is Marie Yovanovich, the former ambassador to Ukraine, who explained how Giuliani's criticism and pressure led to her ouster in April.\n\nHere are five things to look for in the public hearings:\n\nHow far will GOP go defending Trump?\nHouse Republicans have remained unified in defending Trump against the Democratic rules for the impeachment inquiry. To this point, Republicans have focused their opposition to how the inquiry was conducted. Three key panels took depositions behind closed doors that other lawmakers couldn't attend. Then the House authorized public hearings with the support of just Democrats.\n\nTrump said Saturday that there shouldn't be any hearings because there shouldn't be any investigation. He encouraged people to read the summary of his July 25 call with Zelensky rather than listen to witnesses with third-hand knowledge.\n\n\"There shouldn't be anything. There shouldn't be impeachment hearings, is what I said,\" Trump said. \"This is a witch hunt at the highest level, and it's so bad for our country.\"\n\nThe approach of hearings focused attention on the president's actions, but some Republicans have said even if Trump's request for investigations was inappropriate, it doesn't merit impeachment.\n\nRep. Mac Thornberry of Texas, the top Republican on the Armed Services Committee, said it was inappropriate for a president to ask a foreign leader to investigate a political rival. But Thornberry said the July 25 call sounded like how Trump talks regularly and shouldn't be grounds for impeachment.\n\n\"I believe it was inappropriate,\" Thornberry told ABC's \"This Week with George Stephanopoulos\" on Sunday. \"I do not believe it was impeachable.\"\n\nImpeachment inquiry:Read all the transcripts from the closed-door testimony in the Trump impeachment inquiry\n\nRep. Will Hurd, R-Texas, also said a president shouldn't urge the investigation of a political rival, but that calls for impeachment were premature.\n\n\"I think if you're trying to get information on a political rival to use in a political campaign \u2013 is not something a president or any official should be doing,\" Hurd, a former CIA officer who serves on the Intelligence Committee, said on \"Fox News Sunday.\" \"I think everybody has \u2013 most Republicans have said that that would be a violation of the law.\"\n\nSen. John Kennedy, R-La., said he would look for evidence of the president's motivations if the House sends articles of impeachment for trial in the Senate.\n\n\"Here are the two possible scenarios,\" Kennedy said Sunday on CBS's \"Face the Nation.\" \"No. 1, the president asked for an investigation of a political rival. No. 2, the president asked for an investigation of possible corruption by someone who happens to be a political rival. The latter would be in the national interest. The former would be in the president's parochial interests and would be over the line.\"\n\nWill a consistent narrative emerge?\nThe initial witnesses will describe how two channels of diplomacy emerged. Taylor learned gradually from May through September about demands for Ukraine to investigate the Bidens and Burisma, first as a condition for a meeting between Trump and Zelensky and then as a condition for Ukraine to receive military aid. Taylor called the trade-off \"crazy.\" Kent raised concerns about Giuliani's private back-channel efforts, testifying that Trump \"wanted nothing less than President Zelensky to go to microphone and say investigations, Biden, and Clinton.\" And Yovanovich explained how Giuliani's criticism and pressure led to her ouster in April.\n\nCongressional Republicans asked to hear from Kurt Volker, the former U.S. special envoy to Ukraine, on the same panel as Taylor and Kent because Volker dealt first-hand with Giuliani and others. Rep. Lee Zeldin, R-N.Y., argued that witnesses such as Taylor and Kent had only indirect knowledge of the arrangements because neither spoke directly to Trump or Giuliani.\n\nClosed-door testimony:Who are the 15 witnesses in the Trump impeachment inquiry and what have they said?\n\nVolker in his closed-door testimony described Trump's longstanding presumption of corruption in Ukraine. \"And like a lot of business people, I think he just recoiled at the corrupt environment,\" Volker said. The special envoy also said \"no,\" when asked if Trump asked Ukraine to manufacture dirt on the Bidens, in contrast to looking for evidence of whether Burisma tried to influence the 2016 U.S. election.\n\n\"Even if he's asking them to investigate the Bidens, it is to find out what facts there may be rather than to manufacture something,\" Volker said.\n\nJimmy Gurule, a former federal prosecutor who is now a law professor at Notre Dame, said the hearings will put arguments about serious allegations into a public forum for the American people to decide whether the president's conduct was appropriate. Republicans and Democrats may have made up their minds already, he said.\n\n\"But there are independents, many of whom are on the fence and many of whom haven't made up their minds about the nature of this scheme and whether it was an abuse of power or not,\" Gurule said. \"I think that in the end is the intended audience.\"\n\nHow much was Trump involved?\nMuch of the closed-door testimony credited Giuliani with guiding Ukraine policy to push for investigations. But how much was Trump involved?\n\nGordon Sondland, the U.S. ambassador to the European Union, said Trump told him at a May 23 briefing on Ukraine to deal with Giuliani, who \"emphasized that the president wanted a public statement from President (Volodymyr) Zelensky committing Ukraine to look into anti-corruption issues.\"\n\nFiona Hill, a former National Security Council senior director for Europe and Russia, asked Sondland in late June who assigned him to oversee Ukraine. \"And he said, the president,\" Hill said.\n\nGiuliani also said repeatedly he was working for Trump. Giuliani tweeted Nov. 6 that his investigation was done solely as a defense attorney to protect Trump from false charges.\n\nTaylor said during a July 18 conference call that an unidentified Office of Management and Budget staffer said the directive to withhold military aid \"had come from the president to the chief of staff to OMB.\"\n\nTrump and his Republican defenders have insisted that while he asked Ukraine to investigate the Bidens during the July 25 call, he didn't explicitly mention the trade-off for military aid.\n\n\"The fundamental facts have never changed and will never change,\" said Rep. Jim Jordan of Ohio, the top Republican on the Oversight and Reform Committee who joined the Intelligence Committee to participate in the hearings. \"There was no pressure, no pushing, no quid pro quo.\"\n\nWill Republicans attack Yovanovitch?\nYovanovitch was a career foreign service officer serving as U.S. ambassador to Ukraine when she was removed abruptly in late April, after months of criticism by Giuliani. Hill called the removal \"a real turning point\" among diplomats recognizing Giuliani's influence because \"there was no basis for her removal\" based on a  \"a mishmash of conspiracy theories\" that had \"no merit whatsoever.\"\n\nRepublicans have questioned whether Yovanovitch collaborated with Democrats, as they have alleged with the whistleblower. Zeldin asked during her closed-door deposition about her contacts with the House Foreign Affairs Committee after her recall from Ukraine. Yovanovitch testified that she received two emails from a staffer and referred the person to the State Department.\n\nBut Zeldin said department emails suggested she had more contacts, saying she apparently \"did not accurately answer this question\" under oath. Republicans earlier drew attention to the whistleblower's intermediary contacting the House Intelligence Committee before filing a complaint about Trump's July 25 call.\n\nTrump retweeted Zeldin's exchange with Yovanovitch, calling it \"a terrible lie. How can she do such a thing?\"\n\nBut the committee headed by Rep. Eliot Engel, D-N.Y., tweeted in reply to Trump that the panel had \"already debunked this ugly smear.\"\n\nWhat's happening with GOP witnesses?\nRepublicans on the House Intelligence Committee asked Saturday for nine categories of witnesses at the public hearings scheduled to begin Wednesday. Under rules the House adopted for the hearings, Intelligence Chairman Adam Schiff, D-Calif., could reject any of the requests. Republicans could ask for a vote on any rejections, but Democrats control the committee and it's not clear how many will be allowed or rejected.\n\nRepublicans requested testimony from the whistleblower, the only witness Schiff rejected outright, and any individuals who helped the person prepare the complaint about the July 25 call.\n\nSchiff said the panel wouldn't help Trump threaten, intimidate or retaliate against the person who filed the complaint with the inspector general for the intelligence about the call. Andrew Bakaj, one of the whistleblower's lawyers, said his client was willing to answer written questions, but not in person out of concern about being identified.\n\nGovernment officials who testified in closed-door depositions are also on the Republican witness list: David Hale, the undersecretary of State for political affairs; Tim Morrison, the National Security Council senior director for Europe and Russia; and Volker.\n\nRepublicans also requested subpoenas for Hunter Biden and Devon Archer, a Biden business partner who was a fellow board member for Burisma, to ask about possible corruption at the company.\n\nMitt Romney:a solitary GOP voice battling Trump for the soul of the Republican Party\n\nAnd Republicans sought testimony from two witnesses associated with the 2016 election: Nellie Ohr, a contractor for the research firm Fusion GPS that produced the dossier of alleged ties between Trump and the Kremlin, and Alexandra Chalupa, a Democratic National Committee staffer with alleged connections to Ukrainian efforts to interfere with the election.\n\nSchiff replied to Rep. Devin Nunes of California, the top Republican on the Intelligence Committee, that he was reviewing the requests. But Schiff sounded pessimistic in his Saturday reply to Republicans about accepting the Bidens or political operatives as witnesses.\n\n\"As we move to open hearings, it is important to underscore that the impeachment inquiry, and the committee, will not serve as vehicles for any member to carry out the same sham investigations into the Bidens or debunked conspiracies about the 2016 U.S. election interference that President Trump pressed Ukraine to conduct for his personal political benefit,\" Schiff said.\n"

        "title": "Did Trump just commit witness tampering? I asked 7 legal experts.",
        "text": "When Marie Yovanovitch, the former ambassador to Ukraine, testified on Capitol Hill Friday morning during the second day of impeachment hearings against President Donald Trump, it didn't take the president long to send a tweet attacking her.\n\n\"Everywhere Marie Yovanovitch went turned bad,\" Trump wrote. \"She started off in Somalia, how did that go? Then fast forward to Ukraine, where the new Ukrainian President spoke unfavorably about her in my second phone call with him. it is a U.S. President's absolute right to appoint ambassadors.\"\n\nYovanovitch was ousted from her ambassadorship back in April after she apparently got in the way of Trump's efforts to persuade the government of Ukraine to investigate Joe Biden.\n\nHer testimony on Friday was clear, calm, and mostly unflattering to the Trump administration. \"As Foreign Service professionals are being denigrated and undermined,\" she told members of Congress, \"the institution is also being degraded. This will soon cause real harm, if it hasn't already.\"\n\nTrump has a habit of blasting critics on Twitter. But some observers \u2014 including some loyal to the president \u2014 said this tweet was, at best, a very bad idea.\n\nBut did this tweet really cross a legal line into witness tampering?\n\nI put this question to seven legal experts. Their responses, edited for clarity and length, are below.\n\nThere wasn't a perfect consensus, but most experts agreed that Trump's tweet falls pretty clearly within our understanding of an impeachable offense. As to whether or not it constitutes a crime, the question is almost irrelevant since prosecution is all but impossible.\n\nCiara Torres-Spelliscy, law professor, Stetson University\nAccording to the Department of Justice, intimidation of witnesses testifying before Congress is a crime under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1515(a)(1). However, in this case it is the president who is allegedly doing the witness intimidation and an OLC opinion (see Indicting a President Is Not Foreclosed: The Complex History - Lawfare) states that a sitting president cannot be indicted.\n\nJust as Trump cannot be indicted for campaign finance crimes while president such as those involving Michael Cohen, he similarly could not be indicted for witness intimidation including his tweets this morning either while he is still in office. But accountability can come in different forms. The House of Representatives could add witness intimidation as a separate article of impeachment. Also, once Trump is an ex-president, federal prosecutors could charge him with witness intimidation if they chose.\n\nJoshua Dressler, law professor, Ohio State University\nTo be guilty, Trump would need to actually intimidate the witness from testifying, which he didn't, and it would have to be proven that it was his intention to intimidate. He could easily argue that he is just informing us of how bad the witness was at her job or he even could say, \"you know I bad mouth people, witness or no witness. That's just my ugly habit.\"\n\nPaul Butler, law professor, Georgetown University\nTrump's tweet is a stone cold thug move. Let's say I am federal prosecutor investigating a mob boss. A witness testifies that she felt intimidated by the mob boss. As she speaks, the mob boss denigrates the witness in a tweet.\n\nI would halt the proceeding \u2014 for the safety of the witness \u2014 and ask the judge for a warrant for the arrest of the mob boss. The United States Criminal Code makes witness intimidation a felony. The fact that a mob boss lives in the White House should not excuse him from being brought to justice.\n\nDiane Marie Amann, law professor, University of Georgia\nImpeachment is a legal process, in that the US Constitution provides for charging of \"high crimes or misdemeanors\" by the House, followed by trial in the Senate. Impeachment is not a federal criminal proceeding, however.\n\nFor this reason, evaluation of the president's statements \u2014 in tweets, in phone conversations, at press gaggles, and the like \u2014 should turn not on whether the precise elements of a federal crime like witness tampering have been met, but rather on whether the statements constitute, or contribute to, abuses of the public trust that justify the president's impeachment and removal from office.\n\nPeter Shane, law professor, Ohio State University\nIf Trump were a criminal defendant charged with witness tampering, I assume his defenses would be: (1) he couldn't have been intimidating Ambassador Yovanovitch because she was already testifying, and (2) his tweets were not directed specifically at any other witness.\n\nBecause I am not a criminal law expert, I do not know if (2) would or would not be a legally cognizable defense. (If a mob boss tweets, \"Bad things are gonna happen to anyone who testifies about my kid,\" I don't know if it's a defense that he would not have explicitly targeted a specific witness.)\n\nPutting that aside, however, it must be said for the gazillionth time that impeachment is not a criminal process. For the president of the United States to seek to interfere by intimidation with testimony before a congressional hearing plainly falls within Alexander Hamilton's understanding of an impeachable offense: \"an abuse or violation of some public trust\" that amounts to an injury \"done immediately to the society itself.\"\n\nPeter Margulies, law professor, Roger Williams University School of Law\nTrump's live-tweeting during Ambassador Yovanovitch's testimony was inappropriate but did not constitute witness tampering. The federal crime of witness tampering requires proof of intent to influence the witness. Trump's critique of Yovanovitch's performance as a diplomat in Somalia and elsewhere doesn't show that crucial intent to influence.\n\nIf Trump had threatened Yovanovitch's position in the U.S. foreign service \u2014 for which she thankfully has statutory protections \u2014 the charge of witness tampering might stick. But mere criticism \u2014 no matter how partisan, ill-founded, and unfair \u2014 doesn't equal witness tampering. That's also true of witness tampering in the context of impeachment.\n\nIn Federalist No. 66, Alexander Hamilton envisioned impeachment as a political process run by Congress. That means Congress can impeach a president even if the executive actions at issue are not literally crimes but are abuses of power, as in the presidential phone call that triggered the Ukraine impeachment inquiry.\n\nBut Hamilton and the rest of the framers knew that politics is sometimes unfair; with the rise of political parties early in the Republic, all of the major players during the founding era were subject to scurrilous charges on a daily basis. For example, supporters of Jefferson attacked President Washington as a supposed lackey of Hamilton and Hamilton as an agent of Great Britain. Washington wisely didn't see fit to respond to these allegations himself, but criticizing his accusers would not have been witness tampering, even if Washington's opponents had sought to impeach him (as they came close to doing with Washington's successor, John Adams).\n\nThe \"abuse of power\" theory of impeachable offenses allows the President and his supporters the right of reply in the political realm. Criticism of a witness's past is part of that political process. It may show that the president doesn't \"get it\" and will continue to abuse his power, making impeachment all the more imperative. But it's not witness tampering.\n\nJed Shugerman, law professor, Fordham University\nHigh crimes and misdemeanors are not limited to felonies. In its articles of impeachment, the House should add Trump's repeated practice of witness intimidation over three years as an abuse of power and as high misdemeanors. In context, this behavior is clearly impeachable.\n\nBut many legal commentators argued explicitly that Trump's tweets this morning were crimes of witness intimidation, tampering, and obstruction, and I think that's a mistake. Such an interpretation runs the risk of creating a slippery slope to infringe on the free speech of potential defendants to criticize witnesses and make public their own defense. They run the risk of communicating an overly aggressive scorched-earth approach to criminal law by Trump's critics, who have no shortage of stronger legal arguments.\n\nThe content of the tweets were not threats. One statement that commentators focus on is the following: \"They call it \u2018serving at the pleasure of the President.'\" They suggest it's a threat to fire a current employee. But in context, it was an explanation for his power to have removed her earlier. There is a valid question about whether a boss needs to be more careful than even a remote implication about firing in retaliation, but a fair reading of context suggests this didn't cross that line.\n"

        "text": "The future of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program that protects hundreds of thousands of young undocumented immigrants from deportation could be in the hands of Chief Justice John Roberts, after the Supreme Court's conservative and liberal blocs seemed split on the policy during oral arguments Tuesday.\n\nThe five conservative justices, including Roberts, expressed skepticism toward arguments that President Trump insufficiently explained his reasons for rescinding the Obama-era program in 2017. But Roberts also asked questions that indicated he could join the court's liberal justices in keeping the DACA program alive.\n\nThe four liberal justices questioned whether the administration had sufficiently weighed the fact that not just DACA recipients, but their families, co-workers, schools and the military had relied on the program for years before Trump moved to end it. Federal law requires an administration to offer a rational basis for certain policy decisions, which the parties challenging Trump's action \u2014 including the state of California and the University of California system \u2014 argue would include rescinding DACA.\n\nSome in the liberal bloc also asked how the court should handle the legality of DACA itself. Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg called the administration's rationale \"infected\" with the idea that DACA itself was illegal, which courts have not held.\n\nJustice Sonia Sotomayor asked whether the administration had ever conceded that its decision amounted to, in her paraphrase, \" \u2018our choice to destroy lives.' \"\n\nDACA protects young undocumented immigrants who came to the U.S. as children. If the court sides with the Trump administration, all of them could lose the ability to work legally in the U.S. and be subject to deportation to countries most of them have never known.\n\nThen-President Barack Obama created DACA in 2012 to offer recipients protection from deportation and the ability to work and study in the U.S. Nearly 800,000 immigrants had benefited under the program by the time Trump decided to terminate it. An estimated 200,000 recipients live in California, more than in any other state.\n\nThe Trump administration argued that DACA was likely to be struck down in the courts, and thus should be ended in an orderly fashion. But states, advocacy groups and DACA recipients quickly challenged the move. Federal judges in California, New York and Washington, D.C., prevented the administration from ending DACA and ordered the Department of Homeland Security to continue renewing recipients' two-year permits; but no new immigrants have been enrolled.\n\nMuch of the 80-minute argument session Tuesday focused on whether the court is able to review Trump's termination of DACA. The Justice Department has argued that choosing whether to enforce the law is an act of executive discretion, which is not subject to judicial review.\n\nJustices interrogated attorneys for both sides about that assertion, bringing up examples such as an administration developing a policy not to prosecute certain marijuana crimes.\n\n\"Everybody's struggling, including me: Where is the line?\" asked Justice Stephen Breyer, a Bill Clinton appointee who typically votes with the court's liberal bloc. He and Justice Neil Gorsuch, a Trump appointee, took turns peppering California Solicitor General Michael Mongan with such questions. Mongan argued the case on behalf of the states challenging Trump's effort to rescind DACA.\n\nMongan argued that the court did not need to come up with a rule to decide all cases in which an administration exercises discretion, but could focus on the merits of the DACA decision itself. Given the scope of DACA and the number of people affected by it, he said, the justification for terminating it is something the courts can scrutinize.\n\nGinsburg, another Clinton appointee, suggested to U.S. Solicitor General Noel Francisco that the administration's argument had a \"strange element\" in claiming the Department of Homeland Security had no choice but to end the program because it was probably illegal, while also claiming the decision was discretionary.\n\n\"How can it be committed to your discretion when you say, \u2018We have no discretion?' \" Ginsburg asked.\n\nIf the court decides the judicial branch has no authority to review the decision, Trump would likely be free to end DACA as he planned. Trump has repeatedly described ending DACA as designed to force Congress to pass a law accomplishing the same effect.\n\nIn a tweet Tuesday, Trump said without evidence that some DACA recipients \"are very tough, hardened criminals,\" though a criminal background check is required to qualify for the program.\n\nBut Trump also tweeted that \"if Supreme Court remedies with overturn, a deal will be made with Dems for them to stay!\" The president has dangled the possibility of such a deal before, but has walked away from Democratic offers that would include his border wall, holding out for more hard-line measures.\n\nThe justices also wrestled with whether the administration had sufficiently justified its decision to terminate DACA. Ginsburg, Sotomayor, Breyer and Obama appointee Justice Elena Kagan all expressed skepticism that Trump and his Cabinet officials had adequately explained their rationale.\n\nBreyer noted the hundreds of friend-of-the-court briefs from health organizations, religious groups, educational institutions, military entities, businesses and others that said rescinding DACA would have widespread negative consequences for the country.\n\nTheodore Olson, a former U.S. solicitor general and now a lawyer who represented some of the private plaintiffs in the case, described the administration's assessment of those consequences as, \"Too bad.\"\n\nBut the conservative justices questioned what more the government could do to explain itself, and got plaintiffs' lawyers to concede the administration does have the authority to end the program \u2014 just with a better rationale.\n\n\"What more would you have the government say?\" Gorsuch asked the plaintiffs' lawyers, who have urged the court to send the DACA recission back to the administration for another attempt. \"If it's a failure of adequacy of explaining ... what good would another five years of litigation over the adequacy of that explanation serve?\"\n\nRoberts has emerged as the court's swing vote in closely watched cases. While he often sides with his conservative colleagues, he also provided the key vote in blocking Trump from adding a question about citizenship to the 2020 Census.\n\nRoberts' interjections on Tuesday offered few clues as to how he was leaning. At times, he seemed sympathetic to arguments that ending DACA was not reviewable. But he also suggested the Department of Homeland Security was wrong to conclude that a court challenge to DACA would have resulted in its abrupt, chaotic termination.\n\nCalifornia Attorney General Xavier Becerra was on hand for the oral arguments, as was UC President Janet Napolitano, who was the Homeland Security secretary who signed the memo creating DACA.\n\nOn the Supreme Court steps after the arguments ended, Becerra said the administration tried to terminate DACA \"the wrong way.\"\n\n\"Just as our parents would tell us, or a referee on the field would tell you, if you do it the wrong way, you get penalized,\" Becerra said.\n\nThe court is expected to rule on the case by June.\n\nSan Francisco Chronicle staff writer Tatiana Sanchez contributed to this report.\n"

        "title": "Taylor testifies he was told Trump cared more about 'investigations' than Ukraine",
        "text": "William Taylor, the top U.S. diplomat in Ukraine, on Wednesday said that U.S. Ambassador to the European Union Gordon Sondland told a member of his staff in July that President Trump cared more about an investigation into former Vice President Joe Biden than he did about Ukraine.\n\nTaylor described the conversation relayed to him last week by a member of his staff during his opening remarks at the first hearing in the House impeachment inquiry on Wednesday.\n\n{mosads}According to Taylor, the conversation took place on July 26, the day after a phone call between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in which Trump raised investigations into the 2016 election interference and the Biden family. Taylor said his staffer, who he did not name, overheard a phone call between Sondland and Trump during which the president asked the EU ambassador about the investigations.\n\n\u8939mbassador Sondland called President Trump and told him of his meetings in Kyiv. The member of my staff could hear President Trump on the phone, asking Ambassador Sondland about \u8a54he investigations,\u6cbc Taylor said.\n\n\u8939mbassador Sondland told President Trump that the Ukrainians were ready to move forward. Following the call with President Trump, the member of my staff asked Ambassador Sondland what President Trump thought about Ukraine. Ambassador Sondland responded that President Trump cares more about the investigations of Biden, which [Trump attorney Rudy] Giuliani was pressing for,?he continued.\n\nTaylor said that Sondland made the comments following a meeting with a top Zelensky aide, Andriy Yermak, in Ukraine. Taylor said he was not aware of the details when he testified behind closed doors in connection with the impeachment inquiry last month and that he was including it for \u895dompleteness.?\n\u8942 reported this information through counsel to the State Department\u8ab7 Legal Adviser, as well as to counsel for both the Majority and the Minority on the Committee. It is my understanding that the Committee is following up on this matter,?Taylor said. \n\nSondland, who testified privately before the committees before Taylor, has also corrected his remarks to say that he told Yermak during a meeting on Sept. 1 that aid to Ukraine would not likely flow until Kyiv made a public statement about pursuing investigations related to 2016 election interference and Burisma, a Ukrainian energy firm with ties to Hunter Biden.\n\nSondland has sought to distinguish the issue of Burisma from the Bidens, though other witnesses have connected the two. Trump specifically named Biden on the call with Zelensky in July. Sondland is due to testify publicly next Wednesday.\n\nThe Trump administration eventually released military aid to Ukraine, and Kyiv did not make a public statement about pursuing investigations sought by Giuliani and Trump.  \n\nTaylor is testifying on Wednesday as part of the first open hearing in House Democrats?impeachment inquiry. Trump has insisted he did nothing wrong in his interactions with Zelensky, describing the July 25 phone call as \u896derfect?and accusing Democrats of a partisan effort to damage him politically. Trump has said he wanted Ukraine to investigate \u895dorruption?and that his comments had nothing to do with politics.\n\nTaylor testified behind closed doors in connection with the inquiry on Oct. 22. His private testimony was released last week by the House committees leading the impeachment inquiry.\n\nIn his detailed opening remarks, Taylor described many of the interactions with Trump administration officials and other points he touched on during his prior testimony.\n\nTaylor described an effort by the administration driven by Giuliani to leverage a White House meeting and aid to Ukraine to press Kyiv to launch investigations that could benefit Trump politically, emphasizing his concerns about it.\n\nHe reiterated his belief that \u8974ithholding security assistance in exchange for help with a domestic political campaign in the United States would be crazy??echoing a remark he made in a text message to Sondland.\n\nAt the same time, Taylor also emphasized he wasn\u8ab8 taking sides ?Republican or Democrat ?during the impeachment hearing and was there only to relay the facts as he knows them.\n\n\u8942 want to emphasize at the outset that while I am aware that the committee has requested my test as part of impeachment proceedings, I am not here to take one side or the other,?Taylor said at the beginning of his remarks.\n\nThe White House later dismissed Taylor and George Kent, the second State Department official testifying, as \u895cureaucrats with a foreign policy gripe?and said they offered no firsthand information. \n\n\u893cems star witnesses can\u8ab8 provide any first hand knowledge of any wrongdoing by @POTUS. Their own testimony contradicts the Dems false quid pro quo narrative. These are essentially two bureaucrats with a foreign policy gripe,?White House press secretary Stephanie Grisham tweeted.\n\nTaylor, a career State Department official who served in both Republican and Democratic administrations, came out of retirement earlier this year at the request of Secretary of State Mike Pompeo to lead the U.S. embassy in Ukraine.\n\nTrump has criticized Taylor and the lawyer representing him as \u8948ever Trumpers,?at one point suggesting last month that Pompeo had made a mistake bringing him on at the State Department.\n\n\u8948EVER TRUMPERS!?Trump tweeted earlier Wednesday morning before the impeachment hearing began.\n\n\u894cEAD THE TRANSCRIPT!?he wrote, referring to the rough transcript of his call with Zelensky that has been released by the White House. \n\nThe White House said that Trump was working in the Oval Office and not watching the impeachment hearing on Wednesday. \n"

        "text": "The Baltimore County Republican official whose social media posts about trash in West Baltimore prompted President Donald Trump to verbally attack the late Rep. Elijah Cummings says she's running for Cummings' former seat in Congress.\n\nKimberly Klacik, 37, who runs a nonprofit and is a member of a county Republican Central Committee, said she will file next week for the special election in the 7th Congressional District, a seat Cummings held for more than two decades.\n\nCummings, who had cancer, died Oct. 17.\n\n\"I am throwing my hat in the race for the 7th Congressional District,\" Klacik said in an interview. \"I've seen firsthand what a lot of people are going through. Our violent crime is up 52% in Baltimore County and it's rising in Baltimore City, too. I don't think it's a coincidence.\"\n\nKlacik lives in Middle River, which is not in the 7th District, but she said she'll move to West Baltimore if elected. The law only requires a congressional candidate to live in the state; they do not need to live in the district they seek to represent.\n\nShe is planning a campaign launch event Tuesday from 6:30 p.m. to 9:30 p.m. at Ryleigh's Oyster House in Hunt Valley. Baltimore County Del. Ric Metzgar, State Sen. Johnny Salling and WBAL radio host Yuripzy Morgan are expected to speak.\n\nKlacik gained attention in July when she posted videos to social media of blight and trash in West Baltimore. Her postings caught the eye of Fox News, which showed them, and then Trump, who launched a blistering attack against Cummings. That kicked off a weeklong war of words between the Republican president and boosters of deep blue Baltimore.\n\nShe has participated in several cleanup events in the district since then.\n\n\"Talking to residents about rats and infrastructure and vacant homes, there's so much that can be done,\" Klacik said.\n\nThree Republican candidates have already filed for the special election to fill the seat, including Liz Matory, who in 2018 sought the 2nd Congressional District seat held by C.A. Dutch Ruppersberger. Republican Chris Anderson said he would announce the start of his campaign Monday in Baltimore.\n\nThe district's voters are 68% Democratic, with just 16% Republican voters and the rest unaffiliated or belonging to third parties, making it difficult for any candidate who is not a Democrat to win the seat.\n\nOn the Democratic side, former congressman and NAACP President Kweisi Mfume and state Del. Talmadge Branch have announced campaigns for the office. State Sen. Jill P. Carter has formed an exploratory committee and is holding fundraising events. Maya Rockeymoore Cummings, Cummings' widow and chairwoman of the Maryland Democratic Party, and former Baltimore Mayor Stephanie Rawlings-Blake are among others who have said they are considering running.\n\nEight other Democrats have formally filed to run.\n\nThere's a deadline of Nov. 20 to file to run in a special primary Feb. 4 in the district, which includes parts of the city of Baltimore and the counties of Baltimore and Howard. After the special primary, a special general election will be held April 28, with early voting beginning April 16. The winner of that election will fill the remainder of Cummings' term, which runs into January 2021.\n\nApril 28 also is the date of Maryland's regular primary election for candidates for Congress from all eight districts in the state; winners will go on to compete in November for two-year terms that begin in January 2021.\n"

        "text": "North Carolina Republicans approved a new congressional map Friday that would cost the party at least two House seats and potentially roil the state's delegation \u2014 but Democrats immediately objected, saying it's still a GOP gerrymander.\n\nRepublicans represent 10 of the state's 13 districts and would be very likely to lose two seats: those held by Republican Reps. George Holdingand Mark Walker. Democrats, though, argue the new map doesn't go far enough and quickly challenged it in state court.\n\n\"The congressional map passed by Republicans in the North Carolina legislature simply replaces one partisan gerrymander with a new one,\" said former Attorney General Eric Holder, who leads the National Redistricting Foundation, which backed the lawsuit. \"This new map fails to respond to the court's order by continuing to split communities of interest, packing voters in urban areas and manipulating the district lines to provide Republicans with an unfair partisan advantage.\"\n\nDemocratic-linked plaintiffs who challenged the initial map filed a brief last Friday contesting the redraw, a move that could delay primaries for Congress and continue to muddle the state's political future with a year to go until the 2020 elections.\n\nRepublicans, meanwhile, are already confronting significant upheaval in their delegation \u2014 even if Democrats don't succeed in convincing the court to go further to unravel the GOP's advantage. Holding is hinting about retirement. And Walker, who was also drawn into a safe, Democratic district, is raising the prospect of primarying a fellow member.\n\n\"We basically have a Wild West of redistricting,\" GOP Rep. Patrick McHenry, who holds a district in the western half of the state, said this week. \"This will be the fourth map in six cycles, and I think that is so confusing for voters.\"\n\nLast month, a three-judge panel appeared poised to strike down the old map, prompting the GOP-controlled state Legislature to act first in the hopes of minimizing losses to the party's congressional delegation.\n\nUnder the GOP's redraw, Holding's district now includes more of Wake County, taking in the city of Raleigh. Walker's new seat unites Greensboro and Winston-Salem \u2014 and an insurmountable number of Democratic voters.\n\nHolding has repeatedly suggested that he would retire if there was no suitable district in which he could run.\n\n\"I never came here to make a career out of being in Congress. There are plenty of other things to do,\" he said this week, repeatedly adding: \"No one is entitled to a congressional seat.\"\n\nBut Walker, a Baptist pastor first elected in 2014 who briefly considered running for Senate earlier this year, said he was not resigned to an early departure and floated the possibility he could run in one of two neighboring districts with new lines that include parts of his original 6th District.\n\n\"Not to overspiritualize it, but we're kind of praying through the process, my family and I,\" he said Friday. \"They have taken the bulk of my district and put the constituents in two other districts, so we're kind of looking at all these options.\"\n\nThe primary is set for March 3, known as \"Super Tuesday,\" though the court could order special primaries at a later date if it rejects the new map. Walker declined to rule out challenging McHenry or Republican Rep. Ted Budd, whose redrawn districts absorbed some of his old seat.\n\n\"You know, I don't even like to think about that,\" Walker said. \"But, I mean, you want to do what's right, ethically. But if you have the bulk of the people that you represent, have just been \u2014 a line's been moved over \u2014 I mean, is that something you take a look at?\"\n\nThe reconfigured map would likely elect eight Republicans and five Democrats, but a few seats have the potential to be competitive, according to a POLITICO analysis. President Donald Trump received less than 55 percent of the vote in seats corresponding to those held by Republican Reps. Richard Hudson and Dan Bishop. Hillary Clinton got 54 percent of the vote in the district held now by Democratic Rep. G.K. Butterfield.\n\nHudson's new district takes in Fayetteville, making it more favorable to Democrats. \"It is what it is. I can't control it,\" he said Thursday.\n\nBishop, who was just elected in a September special election, avoided grabbing a larger slice of Mecklenburg County, which includes the city of Charlotte. But he could still have a somewhat challenging reelection. Trump would have carried the seat by 10 points, down slightly from 12 points under the lines in this year's special election.\n\nMeanwhile, Republican Rep. Mark Meadows took in all of the liberal enclave of Asheville but said he was not worried. \"It's still a conservative district,\" Meadows said. \"If you'll look at the previous elections, I could still take all of Asheville and win by double digits.\"\n\nCopies of the new map began circulating Thursday shortly before Congress convened for an afternoon vote. Butterfield came to the House chamber armed with printed-out copies.\n\nHe insisted he would win his new district comfortably, even though it no longer includes the city of Durham. And as a former state Supreme Court justice, he suggested the map still gave Republicans an unfair advantage.\n\n\"We need a 6-7 map, or a 7-6 map, or a 6-6-1 map. Those would be fair maps,\" he said. \"This appears, on the face of it, to be a 5-8 map, which doesn't quite get us where we need to go.\"\n\nA Democratic challenge of the map could prompt the judges to appoint a special master to craft a new one. An obvious choice would be Nathaniel Persily, a Stanford University law professor who has overseen past court-mandated redraws in the state and is the author of a handful of congressional maps in use throughout the country.\n\nThe DCCC is in talks with prospective candidates in districts that may become more favorable under a new map. Holding already has a few challengers running against him, but the party will likely need to recruit in others.\n\nWhatever map is adopted will be in place only for the 2020 elections. North Carolina legislators will redraw it again after the 2020 census, and the state is slated to gain at least one congressional seat in the next decade.\n\nState legislators are used to constantly reconfiguring their political maps.\n\nFederal judges scrapped the initial map in 2016, deeming it an illegal racial gerrymander. The delegation was forced to run in new districts in a rescheduled congressional primary, where Holding beat then-GOP Rep. Renee Ellmers in a member-versus-member race.\n\nIn interviews Thursday, several North Carolina Republicans said they would wait to reserve judgment on the map until it was finalized, but they seemed to be discussing it privately among themselves in the House chamber as they took votes.\n\nWalker talked separately with NRCC Chairman Tom Emmer (Minn.), and with Budd and Meadows. McHenry, Hudson and Rep. David Rouzer also convened in a back corner.\n\nAs they left the chamber, Hudson denied they had been discussing a specific redistricting map.\n\n\"Might have been talking about the Panthers,\" he joked before hopping on the Capitol subway.\n\nTucker Doherty and Zach Montellaro contributed to this report.\n"

        "text": "The White House is seeking to undercut the accounts of three witnesses who have testified in the Democrats' impeachment inquiry, attacking their claims about President Trump's contacts with Ukraine ahead of this week's public hearings.\n\nIn an email sent Tuesday morning to GOP congressional offices, the White House claimed that the testimonies of top Defense official Laura Cooper as well as Catherine Croft and Christopher Anderson, two onetime assistants to former U.S. special envoy to Ukraine Kurt Volker, \"were filled with hearsay.\" {mosads}\n\nDemocrats had released the transcripts of their testimonies on Monday.\n\nAmong the \"topline takeaways\" the White House put forward was the claim that all three witnesses \"based everything on second, third, and fourth hand information,\" arguing that none of them were on the July 25 phone call between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. \n\nThe White House in particular sought to challenge the claims made by Cooper, the deputy assistant secretary of Defense for Russia, Ukraine and Eurasia, who expressed her dismay over the summer's delay of nearly $400 million in U.S. military aid to Ukraine, painting a portrait of a Pentagon doing battle with the White House over the release of funding deemed \"vital\" to national security.\n\nCooper said she had a \"very strong inference\" that Kyiv knew the aid was being withheld after having conversations with Volker and William Taylor, the top U.S. diplomat to Ukraine who is slated to testify in Democrats' first public hearing on Wednesday.\n\n\"The conversation with Ambassador Volker, because it related to the security assistance needing to be lifted and the importance of that, and he was relating conversations he had had with Ukraine officials. It could have been my inference, yes, a very strong inference that there was some knowledge on the part of the Ukrainians,\" Cooper testified.\n\nThe White House is characterizing her perspective as being unfounded.\n\n\"Cooper's comments about when Ukraine knew about the aid being withheld were conjecture based on information she heard from others,\" the talking points memo reads. \"Cooper's conjecture about when Ukraine knew about the aid being withheld was based on hearsay \u2013 and even then she couldn't recall specifics.\"\n\nThe White House also claimed that Cooper \"testified that she wasn't on the call with Zelensky and doesn't have direct knowledge about the call\" beyond the summarized readout the White House released earlier this year.\n\nBut the talking point appears to undercut the argument Republicans are using in claiming that summary of the call is evidence that the president did not explicitly use the aid as a quid pro quo. Congressional Republicans also did not participate on this call.\n\nThe White House hammered the point that Taylor in his testimony said Ukraine did not know the aid was being withheld until late August, despite him testifying that it was \"my clear understanding\" that the aid was contingent on Zelensky pursuing an investigation into former Vice President Joe Biden, one of Trump's 2020 political rivals.\n\nYet, Croft has challenged this claim, with her telling House investigators that Kyiv knew the aid was being withheld earlier than previously known. \n\nIn her closed-door testimony last month, Croft told House investigators that officials at the Ukrainian Embassy approached her two separate times to privately inquire about the decision to withhold aid, stating that these contacts occurred sometime after July 18 and before Aug. 28, when Politico reported the hold.\n\n\"They found out very early on, or much earlier than I expected them to,\" she told investigators on Oct. 30.\n\nThe White House sought to challenge Croft's testimony by saying that she did not have firsthand knowledge of the July 25 call.\n\nAnd in terms of Anderson, who was Croft's predecessor, the White House also noted he was not on the July 25 phone call. \n\nBut the memo sought to twist Anderson's words, claiming he said \"the issue of investigations never came up in discussions over Zelensky coming to the White House.\"\n\nAnderson testified that while the specific investigations were not explicitly identified in July 18 meeting with Taylor, who was talking about \"the need to avoid specific investigations,\" the former Volker deputy testified that he was aware that Trump's personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, was pushing Ukraine to initiate these two investigations."

Some of the president's Republican allies in Congress have also maintained that quid pro quo deals are an integral and ordinary part of international diplomacy.\n\nExtortion, on the other hand, entails a person or party forcing someone to do something through coercion and threats. The term is also more widely understood than quid pro quo, a Latin phrase meaning \"this for that.\"\n\nFULL TRANSCRIPT:\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: The question is, of course, with our next guest, the assumption, Democratic Congressman Eric Swalwell joins us now, is that when it goes from your committee, from these hearings were about to begin before House intelligence that there will be articles of impeachment voted on that will pass the Democratic controlled House and then end up in the other side of the court in front of Senator Kennedy there. There will be 13 Democrats, nine Republicans who get to ask questions in this next round of three diplomats in the coming days. What is going to be different about this? I mean yeah, cameras are in the room, but is this just show?\n\nREPRESENTATIVE ERIC SWALWELL: Good morning, MARGARET. It's important that the president has due process and evidence is not a conclusion. We have enough evidence from the depositions that we've done to warrant bringing this forward, evidence of an extortion scheme, using taxpayer dollars to ask a foreign government to investigate the president's opponent. But it's important that these witnesses raise their right hands and take questions from both Republicans and Democrats. The president is going to get that. It's important that the Republicans be afforded the opportunity to suggest witnesses that we should call and that we determine whether that is relevant, that-that, you know, the facts are just as important -- as the process behind the facts as far as what, if anything, goes over to the Senate.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: But do you expect anything new from these testimonies or is it going to be a recitation of what we can read in these depositions already?\n\nREP. SWALWELL: These witnesses have been fairly consistent. And for the most part, they've not been coordinating or talking to each other. But again, this is America. And we don't just have, you know, railroading of justice. These witnesses, you know, should come public and you know the American people should judge for themselves, as well as we will, as to what happened here.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Well, on the issue of witnesses that Senator Kennedy was talking about, the- the Republican Party put forward yesterday a list of suggested witnesses they would like to see called. On there Hunter Biden and his business partner. Is it safe to say they will never come before the House Intelligence Committee?\n\nREP. SWALWELL: Well, as Chairman Schiff has said we're not going to go back in time and revisit conspiracy theories that are implicated in the president's call. And you know, it was said- former Secretary of Homeland Security Tom Bossert, who told Jake Tapper a couple of weeks ago that he was telling the president that much of what the president alleged in that phone call to President Zelensky about the Ukrainians involved in 2016 was just nonsense. And so we don't want to revisit conspiracy theories. If people have relevant information to this investigation and the president's conduct, of course, we want to hear from them.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: So that's no to the Bidens?\n\nREP. SWALWELL: I'll leave that to the chairman.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Okay.\n\nREP. SWALWELL: I don't see any relevancy with the Bidens. There's no evidence that any- anything improper has happened and witnesses have been asked about the Bidens and said that Vice President Biden in every way, these witnesses, in the way they worked with him, conducted himself with integrity.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: One member of the National Security Council, Tim Morrison, was on the Republican list. Kurt Volker, the former U.S. envoy to Ukraine. Is it safe to assume they will be before your committee?\n\nREP. SWALWELL: You know, we're going to handle that this week. You know, taking up the Republican witness list and we're going to be fair about it, because, again the fairness behind the process is just as important as the facts.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: You wrote- talking about the fairness of the process, one of the things that gets criticized by Republicans of Democrats is that the outcome's presupposed.\n\nREP. SWALWELL: Yeah.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: And if you just look back at your own record--\n\nREP. SWALWELL: Yeah.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: --back to the spring, you were calling for impeachment. You wrote an op-ed in June calling for impeachment. That was before this whistleblower ever came to light.\n\nREP. SWALWELL: You know what's interesting about--\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: So how can that look fair?\n\nREP. SWALWELL: Yeah.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: How can that be fair?\n\nREP. SWALWELL: You know what's interesting about the op-ed I wrote, I wrote it in response to the president's interview with George Stephanopoulos, where he said if he was offered again dirt on a political opponent from a foreign power, he would again take it. I didn't know when I wrote that op-ed that he was already engaging in this manner with the Ukrainians. But his prior conduct with the Russians suggested that he might do that, which is why I thought at that time we have an upcoming election. We want it to be pure and one that is above, you know, any questions. And this president, you know, needs to be held accountable for his actions.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Former National Security Adviser John Bolton, he has not been subpoenaed. He's deferring to a court to sort of decide who he needs to listen to. The- the White House tells him not to comply or Congress who has asked him to come and answer questions. Why don't you think you need to hear from him? Why can't you wait until December until a court would decide?\n\nREP. SWALWELL: We'd like to hear from him, but we've heard from three of his deputies who've provided consistent testimony about what was going on in this shakedown scheme. We've asked him to come in, but the White House has told him not to come in. And we're not going to chase witnesses to the courts, because even if a court ruled in December that he has to come in it would be- it will be appealed to a circuit court of appeals and then ultimately up to the Supreme Court. We don't have time with an upcoming election that potentially could be compromised by the president's conduct. We need to, you know, move expeditiously but fairly on what we have now.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: But why expeditiously? Why can't you just wait a few weeks?\n\nREP. SWALWELL: Well, it's not a few weeks. It could be all the way up to a year. And we see this as a tactic by the administration to obstruct our investigation. We also believe if the president believed that John Bolton or Mick Mulvaney could offer testimony that would show that he's innocent, he would send them in on horses to our committee to testify. They can't. Which is the reason we believe he's obstructing, which goes to a consciousness of guilt.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: The House Republicans have sort of reshuffled their deck ahead of these hearings and added Congressman Jim Jordan to the committee. And I'm wondering what you think that will do to these public hearings this week. I mean, what will this change?\n\nREP. SWALWELL: You know, they- they could put Johnnie Cochran on their side to ask questions. It's not going to change the facts of this case. Now, if there are going to be stunts, you're going to see again, those stunts will be used by the American people against them to show a consciousness of guilt and a lack of seriousness. I think this is a very serious investigation. This is an opportunity for my Republican colleagues to reset and recognize, also, they're not the public defenders for the president. They don't have to defend him at all costs. They can actually approach this objectively, give him a fair process, ask the right questions and then make a judgment on the facts. But this is not a time for stunts.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: I want to ask you, you had been a presidential race contender for 2020. We saw Michael Bloomberg say he may jump into the race, isn't officially declared. What do you think that does to the lineup?\n\nREP. SWALWELL: It gives the voters more options. But look, I- I think options are good and whoever emerges from this will be battle tested. It's going to flush out weaknesses, this large field, and whoever emerges is going to be a very strong candidate to take on and defeat Donald Trump if he's their nominee next year.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: All right. Thank you very much.\n\nREP. SWALWELL: My pleasure.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: We'll be back in one minute with the new national security adviser to President Trump, the master, Robert O'Brien. Stay with us. It's just ahead.\n"

Every day is an opportunity to make something good happen.\n\n{mosads}\"And I would say, \u2018I've got lawyers and staff people handling this impeachment inquiry, and they should just have at it,'\" he continued. \"Meanwhile, I'm going to work for the American people. That's what I would do.\"\n\nClinton is in a rare position to offer insight on how Trump might handle the prospect of impeachment, given the GOP-controlled House impeached the former Democratic president in 1998.\n\nThe House held its first public hearings on Wednesday in its impeachment inquiry into allegations that Trump pressured a foreign government to investigate a domestic political rival.\n\nWhile Clinton managed to approve legislation and work through an agenda throughout his impeachment process, Trump has said multiple times he will not work with Congress while the Democratic-controlled lower chamber investigates him. That posture has thrown into jeopardy the president's efforts to pass a trade deal and approve legislation to lower drug pricing, among other items.\n\nClinton phoned in to CNN on Thursday to discuss a shooting at a southern California high school that left two dead and multiple people injured. The incident is the latest in a string of school shootings that have unfolded with increasing regularity in recent years.\n\nThe former president signed off on an assault weapons ban in 1994 that has since expired, and he was critical of Republicans in Congress and the Trump administration for failing to address the surge in mass shootings.\n\n\"I mean, I think what happened was \u2014 [Trump] did indicate a couple times he might go along with this and then obviously the gun lobby got ahold of him and pulled him back,\" Clinton said. \"But at some point, you know, denial is no longer an option. And Congress is basically in denial of the consequences of doing nothing. Or at least the people who are opposed to it.\"\n\nThe Trump administration had been in talks with lawmakers earlier this year in the aftermath of back-to-back mass shootings in El Paso, Texas, and Dayton, Ohio. While Trump expressed openness to stronger background checks, talks eventually fell by the wayside.\n\nAttorney General William Barr on Wednesday announced an initiative focused on more rigorously prosecuting gun crimes. Asked about the potential for congressional action on gun violence, Barr told reporters that negotiations had been sidelined because of impeachment.\n\n\"That's just an excuse,\" Clinton said Thursday.\n\nHe advocated for reinstating an assault weapons ban, or at least a clean background check bill that would take advantage of modern technology. Clinton argued that Democrats are unlikely to face the electoral consequences they did in the 1990s given the growing enthusiasm around the issue.\n\n\"If you're just worried about the naked politics, it's at least a wash,\" he said. \"And people should instead do what's right for the children.\""

It makes the case that Democrats failed to present any evidence of quid pro quo in Trump's July 25 call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.\n\nJOE BIDEN SAYS THERE'S 'ZERO RATIONALE' FOR GOP TO CALL ON SON HUNTER TO TESTIFY IN IMPEACHMENT HEARINGS\n\nThey say Trump had a \u8960eep-seated, genuine and reasonable skepticism of Ukraine and U.S. taxpayer-funded foreign aid\" due to the country's history of \"pervasive corruption\" since the collapse of the Soviet Union.\n\nThe memo points out that both Trump and Zelensky have said they felt no pressure during the call. Another piece of evidence cited by the memo's authors is that Ukrainian government officials interfered in the 2016 presidential election in opposition to Trump in an effort to sway the race in favor of former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, a claim that Trump has made but has not been proven.\n\nThe United States provided Ukraine with much-needed security assistance despite it not investigating former Vice President Joe Biden and his son, Hunter, according to the letter. The Ukrainian government was also not aware that security assistance was being withheld at the time of the call.\n\nThe memo cites testimony transcripts of several State Department officials called by House Democrats to give their depositions behind closed doors. The Republicans also accuse Democrats of lacking transparency and hiding information.\n\nThe memo says that Rep. Adam Schiff, chairman of the Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, has been leading the impeachment inquiry from his \"Capitol basement bunker.\" The closed-door impeachment inquiry has generated more than 100 hours of testimony from 15 witnesses. \n\n\u894ehe fact-finding is all unclassified, so the closed-door process is purely for information control.

The memo claims they will still be \u896cne-sided, partisan and fundamentally unfair.?The GOP authors of the letter say there is no co-equal subpoena power, no due process for the president, and no guarantee Schiff will call witness put forward by Republicans.

        "text": "It was Sept. 22 when Secretary of State Mike Pompeo fielded a straightforward question about just-emerging reports that President Donald Trump had sought to pressure Ukraine's president to open two investigations motivated by domestic politics: \"What do you know about those conversations?\"  \n\nPompeo offered an evasive answer, giving the impression that he was unfamiliar with the details of Trump's July 25 call with Ukraine's president, Volodymyr Zelensky. That phone call triggered a whistleblower complaint alleging that Trump had solicited foreign interference in the 2020 election.\n\n\"So you just gave me a report about a, I see, whistleblower complaint, none, none of which I've seen,\" Pompeo told ABC News on that Sunday morning.\n\nIt has now become clear that Pompeo was, in fact, intimately familiar with the campaign by Trump and his personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, to get Zelensky to say publicly that Ukraine would investigate former Vice President Joe Biden and would also probe a debunked conspiracy theory that Ukraine, not Russia, interfered in the 2016 presidential election.\n\nCritics say that Pompeo's credibility has collapsed amid revelations that the State Department chief enabled Giuliani to run a shadow foreign policy operation that undermined Ukraine, a vital U.S. ally under attack from Russia. The scandal has left America's top diplomat weakened in Washington and on the world stage, former diplomats say.\n\nMichael McKinley, a former top aide to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, leaves Capitol Hill in Washington, Oct. 16, 2019, after testifying before congressional lawmakers as part of the House impeachment inquiry into President Donald Trump.\nTestimony takeaways:How Democrats and Republicans are laying out their arguments for impeachment\n\n\"So far, the choices that the secretary of State appears to have made have alienated him from his team, diminishing his ability to carry out our foreign policy,\" said Lee Feinstein, a former U.S. ambassador to Poland and longtime State Department official. Every secretary of State faces a delicate balancing act of trying to keep the president's confidence while giving him blunt advice and navigating complex geopolitical relationships, Feinstein and others say.\n\nBut Pompeo is \"on shifting sand\" as he tries to defend Trump's actions amid a revolt from career State Department diplomats, said Cameron Hume, a 40-year veteran of the foreign service and former ambassador to Algeria, South Africa and Indonesia, among other posts.\n\nThe State Department did not respond to detailed questions for this story. James Jay Carafano, a foreign policy expert at the conservative Heritage Foundation, dismissed the House Democrats' impeachment inquiry as partisan and said Pompeo handled the situation appropriately. \n\n\"There's no evidence that he did anything wrong,\" Carafano said.\n\nPompeo has shrugged off questions about his own actions and dismissed the inquiry as \"Washington noise.\"\n\nBut that \"noise\" has pulled back the curtain on what Pompeo knew about the Ukraine pressure campaign and how he responded. Here's what the testimony so far has shown:\n\nFirst-person cable from Ukraine: 'I am concerned' \nOn Aug. 29, about a month before the Ukraine allegations burst into public view, Pompeo received an urgent cable from his top U.S. diplomat in Ukraine, Bill Taylor, raising alarm bells about the Trump-Giuliani pressure campaign. In that classified missive, Taylor said he was specifically concerned that the Trump administration was withholding vital U.S. military aid, which Ukraine needed to counter Russian attacks, as leverage to force Zelensky to accede to Trump and Giuliani's demands.  \n\n\"I told the secretary that I could not and would not defend such a policy,\" Taylor told lawmakers on Wednesday, during the House Democrats' first public impeachment hearing. \n\nTaylor said he sent that Aug. 29 cable on the advice of John Bolton, then Trump's national security adviser, who also told him to write it in the first person, because that would be sure to catch Pompeo's attention. Most such missives are written in the third person.\n\n\"There are not many first-person cables coming, so it gets attention when it comes in from the ambassador saying: 'I am concerned',\" Taylor recounted during his closed-door testimony in the impeachment inquiry.\n\nTaylor told lawmakers that he never received a response from Pompeo to that message, though he heard the secretary of State took it with him to a White House meeting focused on the Ukraine security. \n\nPompeo has refused to answer questions about what he did with the cable. \"I'm not going to talk about the inquiry this morning,\" Pompeo told the Wichita Eagle on Oct. 24, when he was in Kansas for an event with Ivanka Trump, the president's daughter and a White House adviser.\n\nThe reporter pressed: \"So did you relay (Taylor's) concerns to the president?\"\n\n\"Look, I came here today to talk about workforce development,\" Pompeo responded.\n\nSondland: 'All my actions involving Ukraine had the blessing of Secretary Pompeo'\nGordon Sondland, the ambassador to the European Union, was a central player in carrying out Trump and Giuliani's efforts to pressure Ukraine \u2013 communicating their demands to Ukrainian officials and other U.S. diplomats.\n\n\"I understand that all of my actions involving Ukraine had the blessing of Secretary Pompeo,\" he told lawmakers last month, according to a transcript of his testimony. When he raised Giuliani's involvement in the Ukraine matter, \"Pompeo rolled his eyes and said: 'Yes, it's something we have to deal with,'\" Sondland recalled.\n\nPompeo's response seems to stand in stark contrast with that of Bolton, who warned his deputies to steer clear of Giuliani and called him a \"hand grenade that is going to blow everybody up,\" according to testimony from Fiona Hill, who served under Bolton as the National Security Council's senior director for Europe and Russia.\n\n\"Ambassador Bolton had said repeatedly that nobody should be meeting with Giuliani,\" Hill told lawmakers during her testimony. She said after one meeting with Sondland, Bolton told her to report the conversation to the NSC's lawyer, John Eisenberg. \n\n\"You go and tell Eisenberg that I am not part of whatever drug deal Sondland and (Trump's chief of staff Mick) Mulvaney are cooking up on this,\" Hill recounted. Sondland was working with Mulvaney, who ordered the freeze on aid to Ukraine.\n\nThe White House eventually lifted the freeze amid a bipartisan backlash in Congress. But Sondland told lawmakers that there was essentially a quid pro quo when it came to Trump's Ukraine policy, although he did not use that term.\n\nSondland told lawmakers that a White House visit for Zelensky \u2013 something the Ukrainian leader desperately wanted as a public demonstration of U.S. support \u2013 would be granted only after Zelensky publicly committed to the investigations Trump and Giuliani wanted. Sondland said he \"presumed\" that U.S. military assistance was linked to a public Zelensky statement because there was no other credible explanation.\n\nBoth Hill and Sondland said the Trump administration's actions, in particular delaying the military aid, undermined Ukraine as it was trying to project strength in its war with Russian-backed separatists. That, in turn, undermined U.S. national security.\n\n\"This is actually my worst nightmare,\" Hill said. \"My worst nightmare is the politicization of the relationship between the U.S. and Ukraine and, also, the usurpation of authorities, you know, for other people's personal vested interests.\"\n\nIn her words:Read the transcript of Fiona Hill's impeachment testimony\n\nPompeo has repeatedly argued that Trump's policy toward Ukraine strengthened the country and that the administration was focused on helping Ukraine root out rampant corruption. \n\n\"We have robustly helped the Ukrainian people, and we collectively at the State Department have been focused like a laser on\" helping Ukraine become a pro-Western democracy, he said in an interview Nov. 4 with a Kansas City talk radio show.\n\nPompeo and others have emphasized that under Trump, the U.S. began providing lethal weapons to Ukraine, a more aggressive form of support than the Obama administration had provided.\n\n\"They chose to provide blankets,\" Pompeo said in another recent interview, referring to the Obama administration's Ukraine policy. \"We gave them real weapons, where they could fight against the Russians. I am proud of what the administration did with its Ukraine policy.\"\n\nUkraine Ambassador: Pompeo 'tried to protect me but was no longer able to'\nPompeo helped carry out one of Giuliani's key demands: the removal of Marie Yovanovitch, the former U.S. ambassador to Ukraine. Giuliani alleged she was insufficiently loyal to the president, and he targeted her with \"a campaign of lies,\" according to George Kent, the State Department's deputy assistant secretary for European and Eurasian affairs. \n\nAfter being asked to extend her tenure until 2020, Yovanovitch got phone call in late April of this year: \"I was then abruptly asked to come back to Washington from Ukraine on the next plane,\" she told lawmakers. \n\nShe asked for an explanation, during that initial phone call and again when she got home. She was told that she had not done anything wrong and that Pompeo had \"tried to protect me but was no longer able to do that.\"\n\nFormer U.S. ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch, arrives on Capitol Hill, Oct. 11, 2019, in Washington.\nKent and other top State Department officials felt Yovanovitch had been mistreated, and they pressed Pompeo to release a public statement of support for Yovanovitch. P. Michael McKinley, who was a senior adviser to Pompeo until he resigned last month, said he asked Pompeo about issuing such a statement three times, but Pompeo did not respond.\n\n\"It shouldn't be difficult to put out a short statement that's not political, stating clearly that we respect the professionalism, the tenure of Ambassador Yovanovitch in the Ukraine,\" McKinley told lawmakers in describing his request to Pompeo.\n\nPompeo has not said why he didn't come to the ambassador's defense.\n\nMcKinley said he resigned over Pompeo's refusal to defend career diplomats and a belief that Trump was using the State Department to dig up dirt on a political opponent. McKinley said it was a shocking first in his long career as a diplomat.\n\n\"If I can underscore, in 37 years in the Foreign Service and different parts of the globe and working on many controversial issues, working 10 years back in Washington, I had never seen that,\" McKinley told lawmakers, according to the transcript of his testimony.\n"

        "text": "A U.S. ambassador's cellphone call to President Trump from a restaurant in the capital of Ukraine this summer was a stunning breach of security, exposing the conversation to surveillance by foreign intelligence services, including Russia's, former U.S. officials said.\n\nThe call \u2014 in which Trump's remarks were overheard by a U.S. Embassy staffer in Kyiv \u2014 was disclosed Wednesday by the acting U.S. ambassador to Ukraine, William B. Taylor Jr., on the dramatic opening day of public impeachment hearings into alleged abuse of power by the president.\n\nNew testimony ties Trump more directly to Ukraine pressure campaign\n\n\"The member of my staff could hear President Trump on the phone\" asking U.S. Ambassador to the European Union Gordon Sondland about \"the investigations,\" Taylor testified, referring to the president's desire for a probe of the son of Trump's potential political opponent in 2020, Joe Biden, and the Ukrainian energy company on whose board Hunter Biden once served.\n\nSondland, Taylor said, told Trump in that conversation that \"the Ukrainians were ready to move forward\" on the investigations.\n\nThe U.S. Embassy staffer who overheard the call, political counselor David Holmes, is scheduled to testify Friday before House impeachment investigators in a closed session.\n\n\"The security ramifications are insane \u2014 using an open cellphone to communicate with the president of the United States,\" said Larry Pfeiffer, a former senior director of the White House Situation Room and a former chief of staff to the CIA director. \"In a country that is so wired with Russian intelligence, you can almost take it to the bank that the Russians were listening in on the call.\"\n\nThe impromptu Sondland-Trump conversation took place a day after an official call July 25 between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, in which Trump had pressed for investigations. Zelensky at that time was eager to secure a White House visit. The Trump-Zelensky call and the pressure on the authorities in Kyiv to conduct investigations that could aid Trump's 2020 campaign are at the heart of the impeachment hearings.\n\nIt was also noteworthy in that ambassadors typically don't just pick up the phone and call presidents. \"They never do so to discuss Ukraine policy,\" former U.S. ambassador to Russia Michael McFaul said in a tweet. \"Doing so on a cellphone from Kyiv means [the] whole world was listening in.\"\n\nRussia already has shown its ability to monitor U.S. diplomats' calls in Kyiv, and the Kremlin has no hesi-ta-tion in leaking them when it suits its interests. In early 2014, an intercepted phone conversation between then-Assistant Secretary of State for European and Eurasian Affairs Victoria Nuland and then-U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine Geoffrey Pyatt appeared on YouTube. On the call, Nuland was heard referring dismissively to slow-moving European Union efforts to address a looming political and economic crisis in Ukraine. \"F--- the E.U.,'' she said.\n\nShe also was heard assessing the political skills of Ukrainian opposition figures with unusual candor. The leaked call was embarrassing to Washington and appeared to be an effort by Moscow to drive a wedge between the United States and the European Union. The State Department acknowledged the call was authentic, and Nuland apologized to E.U. officials. But U.S. officials also were quick to blame Russia for the leak, describing it as a form of information warfare.\n\nCalling a president from a cellphone violates protocols set up to protect senior administration officials' communications. \"It's indicative of a lack of concern for operational security,\" said a former senior U.S. intelligence official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to avoid being accused of making statements motivated by political bias. Senior officials, he said, \"are routinely briefed on the threats to their communications. You could assume that talking on an unencrypted line from a foreign country would be on that list.\"\n\nIt is also dangerous for a president to take an off-the-books call like that, Pfeiffer said. That is why call logs are kept, he said. Without them, someone could assert that the president said something on a call, and a log \"protects the president's ability to deny something happened,\" he said. \"Good bureaucratic record-keeping is a protection for someone in the position of the president.\"\n\nThis is not the first time questions have arisen over Trump's un-or-tho-dox phone use. He has been known to give his personal cellphone number to other world leaders, despite aides' warnings that his cellphone calls are not secure. Russia and China in particular have targeted his personal cellphone calls, the New York Times reported.\n\nIn general, Trump has appeared unusually cavalier about operational security. In February 2017, at his Mar-a-Lago Club in Palm Beach, on an open terrace in full view of other diners, Trump and Japan Prime Minister Shinzo Abe had a sensitive discussion about how to respond to a ballistic missile test by North Korea.\n"

        "title": "Gay bar and beer joint appearances: 2020 candidates woo Californians before Democrats convene in Long Beach",
        "text": "Kamala Harris plans to greet supporters at a historic Long Beach gay bar Friday, and Bernie Sanders will get backing from the East L.A. punk-funk band Ozomatli at a local rally Saturday. Amy Klobuchar met voters at a Bay Area brewery Thursday, and Joe Biden pitched his candidacy to young voters at Los Angeles Trade-Technical College.\n\nMore than a dozen presidential candidates are visiting California this week \u2014 an unusual amount of activity in a state that has been viewed primarily as a source of campaign dollars. Most of the top Democrats in the race, and a newcomer to the contest, are congregating this weekend to woo party leaders and activists at a state convention in Long Beach. Two front-runners, however \u2014 Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren and former Vice President Biden \u2014 are skipping the event.\n\nCalifornians probably won't see brightly painted campaign buses crisscrossing the state anytime soon. That's a factor of the timing of other contests and how difficult it is to meet many of the voters in such a vast state. Even after the state moved the date up to March, its presidential primary still will probably be less of a decisive moment than a rubber stamp on the existing trends in the race.\n\n\"The only thing California accomplished by moving up our primary is making the first four states even more important,\" said Dan Schnur, a political science professor at USC and UC Berkeley, referring to Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada and South Carolina, which all vote in February. \"We have Hollywood, we have Silicon Valley, we've got the beach and we've got the mountains. Let Iowa and New Hampshire have some fun.\"\n\nCandidates will be consumed with campaigning in those states, and then they will turn to the Super Tuesday states \u2014 more than a dozen, including California \u2014 that vote March 3.\n\n\"It's a virtual national primary on March 3,\" said Bill Carrick, a veteran Democratic strategist who is not aligned with any candidate in the presidential race. \"I think when the campaigns do a cost-benefit analysis, it will be very sobering.\"\n\nEven if candidates could invest the time campaigning here that they do in states like Iowa and New Hampshire, they still wouldn't be able to reach more than a small fraction of California's 20.3 million registered voters \u2014 unless they spent big on television advertising.\n\n\"Who can afford California? It's the biggest, most expensive state across the board,\" said Sheri Sadler, a veteran Democratic media consultant.\n\nCalifornia contains the most expensive media markets in the nation, notably L.A., San Francisco and San Diego, and a substantive statewide media buy could cost millions of dollars per week, Sadler said. She expects to see candidates start advertising in mid- to late January: \"It's fascinating. I don't know who's going to jump in first.\"\n\nSeveral campaigns are hiring staff and opening field offices in the state, no one more aggressively than Sanders. The Vermont senator has 40 paid staff members in the state, the most of any campaign. Sanders has said California is crucial to his path to securing the Democratic nomination.\n\n\"I need your help to win here in California, because the candidate who wins here in the largest state in the country will, in all likelihood, win the nomination,\" Sanders said at a rally in Sacramento in August. \"And when we win the nomination, we will have to work like hell.\"\n\nRecent polls show a three-way contest in the state among Sanders, Biden and Warren.\n\nBut the way the bulk of California's 495 voting delegates \u2014 the most from any state \u2014 are awarded means candidates who are not polling high still have opportunities to win delegates by micro-targeting their most likely supporters. The state's 53 congressional districts each have up to nine delegates, and each candidate with 15% or more of the district's votes is guaranteed at least one of its delegates.\n\n\"The reality is this is about delegate accumulation,\" said Pete Kavanaugh, Biden's deputy campaign manager. \"We are looking at this almost on a congressional-district-by-congressional-district basis.\"\n\nHe said Biden is uniquely positioned to do well in the state because he has the ability to cross the 15% threshold in every district.\n\nBiden has spent significant time in California raising money, but has not attended Democratic Party gatherings or held large public events with voters. He held his first rally in the state Thursday, at Los Angeles Trade-Technical College.\n\nOther candidates, notably Sanders, Warren and South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg, have held several rallies and other public events around the state. Some are getting together with voters in advance of the California Democratic Party convention this weekend \u2014 including Harris, who plans to greet voters at Portuguese Bend Distilling and Hamburger Mary's in Long Beach on Friday night.\n\nWhen Harris first entered the race, political experts thought California's junior senator may have a home-state advantage. But she has fallen in the polls in the state, as she has nationally. Harris has since gone all in in Iowa, moving staff members from here and elsewhere to the first-to-vote Hawkeye State.\n\nIf she does better than expected in the early states and has momentum going into Super Tuesday, Californians may rally around her, said Dan Newman, a Democratic strategist who previously worked for Harris' campaigns for attorney general and Senate but is not affiliated with her presidential campaign.\n\n\"Home state pride in the past has never been enough on its own to carry somebody,\" he said. But \"if she exceeds expectations in Iowa and South Carolina, and then gets voters to tap into some state pride \u2026 that would be the path.\"\n\nHarris is one of eight candidates chosen to take part in the Real America Presidential Forum sponsored by the state party and Univision News at the convention on Saturday. New Jersey Sen. Corey Booker, former Obama Housing Secretary Juli\u00e1n Castro, billionaire Tom Steyer, businessman Andrew Yang, Minnesota Sen. Klobuchar, Buttigieg and Sanders are also participating.\n\nThree candidates who didn't do well enough \u2014 in polling and support from grass-roots donors \u2014 to make the cut for the forum will address convention-goers earlier in the day. They are self-help author Marianne Williamson and former Reps. John Delaney of Maryland and Joe Sestak of Pennsylvania.\n\nFormer Massachusetts Gov. Deval Patrick, who announced his surprise late entry into the presidential race Thursday, will speak at the convention Saturday morning and take questions from reporters. The appearance will be his first speech in front of a large group of voters since entering the contest. He previously released a video announcing his bid, did several media interviews and met with voters in Manchester, N.H., after filing for a spot in that state's primary.\n\nBiden and Warren's decision not to attend the convention drew condemnation from state party Chairman Rusty Hicks, who called it a \"snub\" of California Democrats and Latinos.\n\nThe candidates' campaigns said scheduling conflicts got in the way: Biden will be stumping in Nevada, and Warren will be rallying voters in Iowa.\n"

        "title": "Briggs: Democrats took over Indianapolis. Now, they have to lead.",
        "text": "The most delightful reaction to Tuesday's Indianapolis election was short, simple and full of joy \u2014 and surprise.\n\n\"I won!\" Ali Brown said in a tweet that seemed partially intended to convince herself the victory was real.\n\n\nBrown, a Democrat, had just defeated Republican Adam Cox in a race to represent the City-County Council's most northeastern district, an area that had been regarded as safely Republican. The district leans so conservative that Cox's campaign strategy seemed to consist of little more than pointing out that Brown happened to be a Democrat who supports liberal-sounding things.\n\nShe won.\n\nBrown's exuberant two-word reaction perfectly encapsulated the night for Democrats, who look to have secured at least 19 and quite possibly 20 out of 25 City-County Council seats pending final results, plus a re-election blowout for Mayor Joe Hogsett. That performance will reshape the council in January from a 14-11 Democratic majority, which has necessitated Republican support to push most proposals across the finish line, to a supermajority in which Democrats will be able to pass anything they can agree on internally.\n\nTo get a sense for just how well Democrats did, consider this: The party had identified nine difficult council races that might have been winnable in a best-case scenario. Democrats swept them all, plus picked up victories in places where they didn't even expect to compete.\n\nDemocrats' longshot victories included Brown in a district that includes Geist; Keith Potts in a district that includes Broad Ripple; Crista Carlino in a district that includes Eagle Creek Park; Ethan Evans in a district that, like Brown's, borders Hamilton County; and Jared Evans, an incumbent, who nevertheless won re-election as a Democrat in a district that supported President Donald Trump in 2016.\n\nRepublicans have explained their 2019 thumping by offering reasons ranging from anti-Trump sentiment to Marion County ballots that made it confusing to skip past the straight-ticket voting option. Some Democrats say their success stems from a coordinated effort between a popular mayor and 25 council candidates.\n\nAs far-fetched as it seemed a few months ago for Democrats to take such a dominant majority on the council, though, that probably won't turn out to be the hard part.\n\nNow, those Democrats have to govern.\n\nThe challenges ahead for council Democrats include overcoming factional battles that are certain to occur, reconciling their caucus' likely left-moving agenda with the heretofore cautious Hogsett administration and gearing up for what could be a contentious redistricting process after the 2020 Census is completed.\n\nIn the short term, though, the greatest challenge for new Democrats might be akin to a police officer who enters the profession to arrest bad guys and finds that most time is spent handling paperwork.\n\nThe passion that propelled the Democrats' 2019 political surge does not necessarily translate well to the day-to-day duties of sitting on the council. For starters, the new members will have to spend much of their time learning how city government works.\n\nWhen the City-County Council meets next year, it will have 12 members, including nine Democrats, who did not occupy their seats a year earlier. That is a substantial influx of council members who might be unfamiliar with the nuances of city contracts, development deals, street repairs, as well as details as minor as following proper meeting etiquette.\n\nFor those councilors, it could feel like whiplash to go from the excitement of knocking on doors and, in some cases, casting a vision for social change, to hearing from constituents who are angry about illegal trash being dumped near their properties.\n\nIt is a difficult and occasionally unfulfilling transition.\n\nIn early 2017, I wrote about seven then-freshmen on the City-County Council who had bonded in part through their shared visions of making the council work better for the city. Of those seven, three just won re-election, one lost, one resigned about a year ago and two decided not to run again.\n\nMany of the council members who were just elected for the first time will not make it to second terms. The most effective ones will be able to channel the energy that drove them to victory last week into doing the best work possible for the people who live in their districts.\n\nThat may or may not lead to sweeping policy changes over the next four years. It may or may not lead to a shift toward Indianapolis being perceived as a more liberal city. None of that is as important as the unsexy things elected officials can do daily to make a positive difference (a space where Hogsett has performed particularly well).\n\nThe Democrats won \u2014 bigger than they could have even hoped for.\n\nNow, they'll be judged by how they handle a thousand small details.\n"

        "text": "Several more witnesses scheduled to testify in the House impeachment hearings over the next week are expected to say they too worried about President Donald Trump's push for Ukraine to investigate Democrats as the U.S. withheld military aid from the country.\n\nWhat's ahead on the impeachment schedule:\n\nMORE WITNESSES\n\nThe House intelligence committee, which is conducting the impeachment hearings, has set a packed schedule of open hearings over the next week.\n\nOn Friday, lawmakers will hear from former U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch, who was ousted in May at Trump's direction. She told lawmakers in a closed-door deposition last month that there was a \"concerted campaign\" against her as Trump and his personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani pushed for probes of Democrat Joe Biden and other political opponents.\n\nEight more witnesses will testify next week, some in back-to-back hearings on the same day. Among them will be Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman, a National Security Council official who said he raised concerns in the White House about Trump's push for investigations; Gordon Sondland, Trump's European Union ambassador, who spoke to the president about the Ukraine policy; and Fiona Hill, a former Russia adviser to the White House who told lawmakers about national security adviser John Bolton's concerns about Ukraine.\n\nAll witnesses testifying this week and next have already spoken to investigators in closed depositions, some of them for 10 hours or more.\n\n___\n\nBACK BEHIND CLOSED DOORS\n\nThough those private depositions are largely done, Democrats have scheduled two more for this week \u2014 at the same time they are conducting the open hearings.\n\nDemocrats have scheduled a closed-door session with David Holmes, the political counselor at the U.S. Embassy in Kyiv, for Friday. An official familiar with the matter said Holmes is the person Taylor referred to in his testimony on Wednesday when he said an aide had overheard a conversation between Sondland and Trump in July about Ukraine conducting investigations.\n\nThey have also scheduled a Saturday deposition with Mark Sandy, an official at the Office of Management and Budget. Sandy is one of several OMB officials who have been invited by the committee to appear as lawmakers try to find out more about the military aid that was withheld. So far, none of those officials has shown up for their depositions as Trump has instructed his administration not to cooperate.\n\nWhile the open hearings are being conducted by the intelligence panel, the closed-door hearings have been held by the intelligence, Foreign Affairs and Oversight and Reform committees.\n\n___\n\nHEADED TO JUDICIARY\n\nThe public hearings are expected to last at least another week. After that, the three committees will submit a report to the Judiciary panel, which will oversee the impeachment process.\n\nJudiciary is expected to hold its own hearings and, eventually, vote on articles of impeachment. Democrats say they are still deciding whether to write them.\n\nNext would come a floor vote, and if articles of impeachment are approved by the House, there would then be a Senate trial.\n\nHouse Democrats are hoping to finish the process by the end of the year. A Senate trial, if called for, would likely come in 2020.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writer Matthew Lee contributed to this report.\n"

        "title": "Transcripts Show GOP 'Terror Campaign' to Out Whistleblower",
        "text": "Republican lawmakers have sought to hijack several impeachment depositions in a crusade for information on the whistleblower who sparked the inquiry, according to a review of the transcripts by The Daily Beast. \n\nEfforts from Republican lawmakers and their counsel to elicit information on the whistleblower\u2014both by asking leading questions and asking point-blank for the person's identity\u2014were repeatedly batted down by Democrats, and in one case the attorney of the witness in disputes that became increasingly caustic. \n\nLast week, The Daily Beast reported that Derek Harvey, an aide to Rep. Devin Nunes (R-CA), the ranking member of the House Intelligence Committee, provided notes for House Republicans ahead of the high-profile testimonies of Trump administration appointees with the name of the alleged whistleblower. The goal was that once the transcripts became public, so would the name of the individual. \n\nIn one example, during the deposition of Lt. Col. Alexander S. Vindman, the National Security Council's top Ukraine expert, minority counsel Steve Castor asked flat-out, \"Is the whistleblower [redacted]?\" \n\nDuring the deposition of acting Ambassador to Ukraine William Taylor, who had testified that military aid to Ukraine was held up against the wishes of top officials including National Security Adviser John Bolton, Rep. Mark  Meadows (R-NC) pressed Taylor for more details on the names of individuals he spoke to at the National Security Council who provided information about Bolton's thinking on the Ukraine situation.\n\n\"I guess I'm a little concerned on who at NSC would've been telling you about Ambassador Bolton,\" Meadows said. \"You felt like he was a kindred spirit on this. So who was telling you from the NSC that he was?\"\n\nLater, Castor asked Taylor if he communicated with or knew of the official that conservative media has identified as the alleged whistleblower. Taylor said he did not know the individual. \n\nTom Devine, legal director for the Government Accountability Project, said if the effort to out the whistleblower's identity was successful it's certainly \"a felony\" under the Whistleblower Protection Act, though he doubted the Department of Justice would prosecute the offenders. \n\n\"It's an attempt to terrorize other witnesses from providing other testimony,\" he said.\n\n\"This new tactic is threatening their lives, it's a terror campaign against anyone bearing witness against the president.\" \n\nThe legal risks of their attempts to out the individual did little to deter those involved, even as Democrats attempted to thwart their efforts. \n\nRepublicans exited certain depositions complaining that House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff (D-CA) \u2014 who ruled that questions about the whistleblower would be off-limits during the hearings\u2014was shutting down their lines of questioning. That was particularly the case with the testimony of Vindman, who was on Trump's July 25 call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and who Republicans believed might know the whistleblower.\n\nThough Vindman said in his opening statement that he would not answer questions about the whistleblower's identity, the released transcripts reveal that Schiff had to cut off Republicans at least five different times over the course of the 10-hour proceeding. \n\nSchiff seemed to get increasingly exasperated as Castor, along with lawmakers such as Rep. Jim Jordan (R-OH) and John Ratcliffe (R-TX), tried different tactics to coax the information about the whistleblower out of the witness, from the blatant\u2014like Castor's straight-up ask\u2014to the more subtle, like asking which people he might debrief about an important call.\n\n\"I am concerned about a bad-faith effort to out a whistleblower who has a statutory right to remain anonymous,\" said Schiff, who instructed Vindman that he did not have to answer any question that might have come close to identifying the whistleblower. \"We will not be a party to the attacks on the whistleblower. We will not put this whistleblower's life at risk or anymore risk than it already is.\"\n\nMinutes later, Schiff and Jordan got into a heated argument when more whistleblower questions came up. Jordan claimed he wanted to protect the whistleblower but went after Schiff for allegedly withholding the person's name, a charge that leans on the chairman's admission that the whistleblower first anonymously contacted his committee for guidance on how to file their complaint. \n\n\"It doesn't make it any more true the tenth time you said it than the first time.\" responded Schiff, \"It just means you're more willful about the false statement?\"\n\nThe questions also exasperated Vindman's attorney, Michael Volkov. Later in that deposition, when Castor went at the whistleblower angle again, Volkov asked, \"If you want to keep going down this road, we're going to just keep objecting, OK?\"\n\nDuring a portion of the deposition of former NSC official Fiona Hill, the GOP attorney rattled off a list of several officials, asking Hill if she knew any of them. That portion was largely redacted in the transcript, hiding its contents from public view, but it appeared similar to a tactic used by Castor during Taylor's deposition to try to narrow the universe of who knew the information contained in the whistleblower complaint. \n\nVisible in the transcript of Hill's deposition, however, was the attendance of Nunes aide Harvey, who was a colleague of Hill's on the NSC during the first year of the Trump administration.  \n\nWhile the whistleblower may have very little recourse under the law, Devine noted that the District of Columbia is one of the only jurisdictions where the individual could seek relief from the effort to out them. In order to do so, Devine said, they would need to file a First Amendment suit in District Court, seeking injunctive relief, including a temporary restraining order, against revealing their identity. \n\n\"It's not true they can do this with impunity,\" he said. \"The assertion that these politicians can engage in this behavior at will is completely false.\" \n\n\u2014 With additional reporting by Spencer Ackerman\n"

        "text": "A U.S. government employee overheard President Donald Trump ask Ambassador Gordon Sondland on the phone about \"the investigations\" and heard the ambassador reassure the president that the Ukrainians were \"ready to move forward,\" a senior diplomat told Congress Wednesday in the first public impeachment hearing.\n\nThe revelation from William Taylor, the top U.S. diplomat in Ukraine, is a significant new development that emerged in a hearing that lawmakers had anticipated would largely reconstruct on television depositions that had taken place previously behind closed doors. But Taylor said he'd only learned from the staffer about the call last week \u2014 after he'd already been deposed privately.\n\nTaylor, who served as the acting ambassador in Ukraine, said his staffer had informed him of events that transpired on July 26, while several senior Trump administration officials were visiting Ukraine. He said one of his staffers had accompanied Sondland to a meeting with Andriy Yermak, a top aide to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy.\n\nAfter that meeting, Taylor said, his staffer was at a restaurant with Sondland, the U.S. ambassador to the European Union, and overheard him on the phone with Trump. Taylor testified that his staffer heard Trump ask Sondland about \"the investigations.\"\n\n\"Ambassador Sondland told President Trump that the Ukrainians were ready to move forward,\" Taylor testified in his opening statement to the House Intelligence Committee.\n\nTaylor said that after the call, his staffer asked Sondland about Trump's views of Ukraine.\n\nRelaying what the staffer had told him about the conversation, Taylor said, \"Ambassador Sondland responded that President Trump cares more about the investigations of Biden, which Giuliani was pressing for.\"\n\nTrump has been accused of pressuring Ukraine to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden and his son Hunter's work for a Ukrainian energy firm. Taylor said Rudy Giuliani, the president's personal attorney, directed an \"irregular\" back channel on Ukraine policy at odds with well-established U.S. policies.\n\nTaylor did not identify the aide who informed him about the incident, but two sources familiar with the matter told NBC News that it was David Holmes, the State Department official just added to the calendar to testify in closed session Friday.\n\nHolmes is the counselor for political affairs at the U.S. Embassy in Ukraine. As Wednesday's hearing got underway, two officials working on the impeachment inquiry told NBC News that Holmes' deposition had been scheduled.\n\nPressed for more details about the incident by the committee's chairman, Adam Schiff, D-Calif., Taylor said Sondland had told his staffer that Trump also cares about Burisma, the Ukrainian natural gas company associated with Hunter Biden that Trump wanted the Ukrainians to investigate.\n\nSchiff asked Taylor whether \"the investigations\" referred to probes into the Bidens and a conspiracy related to the 2016 election.\n\n\"That is correct,\" Taylor said.\n\nTaylor said the overheard conversation between Trump and Sondland had taken place on a cellphone while Sondland was visiting the Ukrainian capital.\n\nSondland, through his attorney, declined to comment.\n\nIt was unclear whether Sondland's remark to Trump that the Ukrainians were ready to proceed with investigations was based on his conversation with Yermak minutes earlier. But the July 26 incident marks a second time that investigations came up in relation to a meeting between Sondland and Yermak, the Ukrainian presidential aid.\n\nSondland, in a sworn declaration to Congress, acknowledged having discussed investigations with Yermak in another meeting in Warsaw, Poland, on Sept. 1. He said he'd told Yermak that aid to Ukraine would \"likely\" not be restored until Ukraine delivered a statement that they had been discussing committing to corruption investigations.\n\nAlthough Sondland had not mentioned that meeting in his private deposition by the House, he later told Congress in writing that his memory had been refreshed after other witnesses testified about the chain of events.\n\nAs the top diplomat in Ukraine, Taylor oversees a large staff at the U.S. Embassy in Kyiv. It's not unusual for diplomats from the embassy to accompany visiting officials to meetings with members of a foreign government.\n\nThe revelation is likely to spark heavy interest from congressional investigators as they continue to piece together the timeline of the Trump administration's pressure campaign on Ukraine, even as the impeachment proceedings move into the public hearing stage.\n\nTaylor says that since his staffer didn't inform him about the incident until Friday, he wasn't aware of it on Oct. 22, when he testified behind closed doors. The House later released a transcript of his lengthy deposition.\n\nTaylor said that once he learned of the information, he reported it through his attorney to State Department lawyers, as well as to both the Democratic and Republican leadership of the House Intelligence Committee.\n\n\"It is my understanding that the committee is following up on this matter,\" Taylor said.\n\nHolmes, meanwhile, once won an award for voicing dissent within the government when he saw something amiss.\n\nHolmes has a history of speaking up when he disagrees, according to an NBC News review of archived materials from the American Foreign Service Association, or AFSA, the union that represents U.S. diplomats. In 2014, he won the AFSA's William R. Rivkin Award for Constructive Dissent, which honors a mid-career foreign service officer for intellectual courage in speaking up.\n\nAt the time of the award, Holmes was senior energy officer at the U.S. Embassy in Moscow. He was recognized for his work on Afghanistan and South Asia, during which he filed a formal dissent channel message in February 2013. He argued that the division of authority for Afghanistan-Pakistan policy among different parts of the State Department \"hindered our diplomatic effectiveness.\"\n\n\"My efforts over this period, and then my formal dissent, were intended to give a voice to an important perspective that I felt lacked an advocate,\" Holmes was quoted as saying in an article in the September 2014 edition of The Foreign Service Journal, the union's monthly magazine.\n\nA dissent cable is a unique State Department mechanism that lets diplomats voice disagreement about U.S. policies, with protections against retribution. They've been used previously during the Vietnam War and in 2017, when diplomats objected to Trump's travel ban on people from several Muslim-majority nations.\n\nThe article says Holmes joined the foreign service in 2002 and has served in Afghanistan and India, as well as on the White House National Security Council as Afghanistan director from 2011 to 2012, during the Obama administration. The article includes an official White House photo of Holmes in the Oval Office shaking hands with President Barack Obama.\n\nA comparison of the photos of Holmes in the AFSA article and on Holmes' Facebook page confirms that the David Holmes who won the award in 2014 is the same David Holmes who is now posted to the U.S. Embassy in Kyiv.\n\nHolmes did not immediately respond to a request for comment, nor did a representative for the AFSA. But two former U.S. officials described him as a straight-shooter.\n\n\"Struck me as very competent and a rising star,\" said a former U.S. ambassador who has worked with Holmes. A former White House official who overlapped there with Holmes said he \"kept his nose to the grindstone and worked a complex issue effectively.\"\n"

Rush Limbaugh @foxandfriends,\" Trump wrote online.\n\n\"Also, why is corrupt politician Schiff allowed to hand over cross examination to a high priced outside lawyer. Did that lawyer ever work for me, which would be a conflict?\" he added.\n\nThe second line of Trump's tweet, which invoked Schiff, appeared to refer to the congressman's plans to yield significant questioning time to Goldman.\n\nIt was not immediately clear whether two of the more well-known lawyers for the intelligence committee's Democratic lawmakers, Goldman and Daniel Noble, ever took on Trump as a client in his capacity as a private businessman \u2014 though such a possibility seems unlikely.\n\nGoldman, the intelligence committee's director of investigations, served 10 years as a federal prosecutor with the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York. Noble, a senior counsel for the committee, also worked in the Southern District, specializing in cybercrime and organized crime prosecutions.\n\n\"The Democrats have stacked the deck against President Trump and the Republicans. They have leaked out everything,\" Trump complained in another morning missive, mentioning the Twitter handles for \"Fox & Friends\" and one of the program's co-hosts, Steve Doocy.\n\nThe president also issued a three-part screed summarizing an appearance on the show by Charles Hurt, a conservative political commentator and the opinion editor of the Washington Times, and later tweeted two of his favored refrains amid the impeachment battle.\n\n\"NEVER TRUMPERS!\" he wrote, adding: \"READ THE TRANSCRIPT!\"\n\nSince 10 a.m., lawmakers have been hearing testimony from Kent, a deputy assistant secretary at the State Department whose portfolio includes Ukraine, and Taylor, the top U.S. envoy to Ukraine.\n\nBoth administration officials were previously deposed before members of three congressional committees last month, and the transcripts of those closed-door sessions were released to the public last week.\n"

She said she found the effect of Trump\u8ab7 words \u8973ery intimidating.?\nSchiff responded: \u8942 want to let you know, Ambassador, that some of us here take witness intimidation very, very seriously.?\nAside from the allegation that this amounts to witness intimidation, this is notably counter to the strategy the GOP employed this week, which was to focus less on attacking the witnesses and more on what they couldn\u8ab8 attest to firsthand.\n\nAnd during the hearing\u8ab7 first break, two high-profile Republicans objected. \u8942 disagree with the tweet,?said Rep. Elise Stefanik (R-N.Y.), who serves on the intelligence committee. \u8942 think Ambassador Yovanovitch is a public servant, like many of our public servants in the Foreign Service.?\nRep. Liz Cheney (Wyo.) the third-ranking House Republican, said Yovanovitch \u895dlearly is somebody who\u8ab7 been a public servant to the United States for decades, and I don\u8ab8 think the president should have done that.?\nKenneth Starr, whose investigation led to Bill Clinton\u8ab7 impeachment in the 1990s, added on Fox News, \u8942 must say that the president was not advised by counsel in deciding to do this tweet. Extraordinarily poor judgment.?\nTrump later denied that he was trying to intimidate Yovanovitch with his tweet.\n\n\u8942 don\u8ab8 think so at all,?he said, when a reporter asked whether his words could be intimidating.\n\nNotably, though, no Republicans took up that thread or defended the tweets.\n\n2. Trump as a one-man foreign policy wrecking crew\nOver the course of her testimony, Yovanovitch painted a picture of a State Department and a U.S. foreign policy establishment held hostage by the whims of the president ?most notably via his tweets.\n\nShe said that when she sought a statement of support from the State Department or Secretary of State Mike Pompeo after Donald Trump Jr. attacked her, she was told no because it could quickly be \u8972ndermined.?\n\u8942 was told there was a concern on the seventh floor??where State Department leaders?offices are ?\u8971hat if a statement of support was issued ?that it could be undermined,?Yovanovitch said.\n\nAsked to clarify, she said it was feared \u8971hat the president might issue a tweet contradicting that.?\nShe also was asked about the rough transcript of the July 25 phone call between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, in which Trump praised the recently removed Ukraine prosecutor general Yuri Lutsenko. She was asked whether it was the position of the U.S. Embassy in Ukraine that Lutsenko was corrupt, and she said repeatedly that it was.\n\nTrump in the call twice praised Lutsenko, saying: \u8942 heard you had a prosecutor who was very good, and he was shut down, and that\u8ab7 really unfair. A lot of people are talking about that, the way they shut your very good prosecutor down, and you had some very bad people involved.?\nIt\u8ab7 not exactly news that Trump\u8ab7 whims can undermine other parts of the government. Yovanovitch basically describes a president who is completely disengaged from official U.S. policy toward top allies and whose tweets his subordinates live in fear of.\n\nLutsenko in March baselessly accused Yovanovitch of giving him a \u8960o not prosecute?list. The State Department issued a statement defending her then, and Lutsenko later retracted the allegation. But even that statement was unattributed to any official, much less Pompeo or any senior officials. That suggested fear of Trump undermining his State Department was a mainstay.\n\n3. A strong rebuke of Pompeo\nYovanovitch is still a State Department employee, despite being removed as ambassador. But she took a moment to pointedly rebuke the leaders of that department.\n\nAnd it wasn\u8ab8 difficult to see her true target: Pompeo.\n\nYovanovitch didn\u8ab8 just accuse State Department leaders of failing to stand by her amid the smear campaign ?which has been borne out in other testimony ?she also said that they failed to maintain a robust Foreign Service.\n\n\u8939t the closed deposition [last month], I expressed grave concerns about the degradation of the Foreign Service over the past few years and the failure of State Department leadership to push back as foreign and corrupt interests apparently hijacked our Ukraine policy,?she said. \u8942 remain disappointed that the department\u8ab7 leadership and others have declined to acknowledge that the attacks against me and others are dangerously wrong.?\nMarie Yovanovitch gives Democrats the compelling ?and sympathetic ?witness they needed\n\nShe added: \u8947oreover, the attacks are leading to a crisis in the State Department as the policy process is visibly unraveling, leadership vacancies go unfilled, and senior and mid-level officers ponder an uncertain future and head for the doors. The crisis has moved from the impact on individuals to an impact on the institution. The State Department is being hollowed out from within at a competitive and complex time on the world stage.?\nYovanovitch did not mention Pompeo by name, but it\u8ab7 not difficult to connect the dots.\n\nTop Pompeo aide Michael McKinley testified that he and other top officials lobbied for a statement in support of Yovanovitch in late September but was told that Pompeo decided against releasing such a statement ?in part to \u896bot draw undue attention to her.?\n4. A gender-centric stunt\n\nAs The Post\u8ab7 Elise Viebeck wrote ahead of Friday\u8ab7 hearing, gender dynamics loomed large over the proceedings. And during the hearing\u8ab7 first break, Rep. Lee Zeldin (R-N.Y.) declared that Democrats were trying to get Yovanovitch to \u895dry for the cameras.?\nBut arguably the most significant moment on that front was one that was manufactured by Republicans ?and rather transparently so.\n\nAfter returning from the first break, Nunes tried to yield time for questioning to Stefanik. But Schiff said Nunes couldn\u8ab8 do that ?that he could yield only to his counsel or ask questions himself. The Republican professed to be perplexed. \u8953ou\u8ab6e gagging the young lady from New York??Nunes said incredulously. The optics would seem to be pretty bad for Schiff; he was silencing the committee\u8ab7 only female Republican, for apparently no reason except spite.\n\nExcept that\u8ab7 hardly the case. The rules as voted on by the broader House last month were clear: The chairman, Schiff, and the ranking member, Nunes, each got 45-minute periods to either ask questions or yield to a staff member. (The resolution says: \u8949nly the chair and ranking minority member, or a Permanent Select Committee employee if yielded to by the chair or ranking minority member, may question witnesses during such periods of questioning.? Afterward, each member would get five minutes, during which they can yield to other members.\n\nStefanik still tried to use the moment for political hay, tweeting, \u8949nce again, Adam B. Schiff flat out REFUSES to let duly elected Members of Congress ask questions to the witness, simply because we are Republicans.?\nThat is just not true ?Schiff was acting firmly within the rules ?and Nunes and Stefanik have to know that. It\u8ab7 pretty apparent this was a stunt.\n"

        "text": "Marie Yovanovitch told lawmakers she had only U.S. interests in mind while serving as ambassador to Ukraine at an impeachment inquiry hearing Friday during which President Donald Trump tweeted insults at her.\n\nYovanovitch, 61, also responded to debunked GOP claims that Ukraine meddled in the 2016 U.S. elections, and agreed that the military aid the Trump administration endorsed \u2013 and is now at the heart of the investigation \u2013 has benefited the Eastern European country in its war against Russia.\n\nYovanovitch, recalled as ambassador in May after falling out of Trump's favor, is a key witness in the House impeachment inquiry into the president's efforts to pressure the East European country to investigate his political rivals.\n\nFriday's open session before the House Intelligence Committee was the second public hearing of the inquiry following testimony Wednesday by veteran diplomats Bill Taylor George Kent.\n\nNot long after the hearing began, Trump began tweeting critically about Yovanovitch as she was testifying about the \"smear\" campaign administration officials had waged that led to her ouster in May.\n\nThe hearing lasted about five hours with Democrats trying to show that Trump removed Yovanovitch to make it easier for his allies to pursue political goals and Republicans saying U.S. policy toward Ukraine improved after Trump became president.\n\nHere are several takeaways from Friday's hearing:\n\nYovanovitch: 'I had no agenda'\nDuring her testimony, the ambassador tried to portray herself as a straight shooter whose top priority was carrying out U.S. priorities.\n\n\"I entered the Foreign Service understanding that my job was to implement the foreign policy interests of this nation, as defined by the President and Congress, and to do so regardless of which person or party was in power,\" she told lawmakers. \"I had no agenda other than to pursue our stated foreign policy goals.\"\n\nFormer Ukraine ambassador Marie Yovanovitch testifies before the Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence on Nov. 15, 2019, in a public hearing in the impeachment inquiry into allegations President Donald Trump pressured Ukraine to investigate his political rivals.\nLater under questioning, Yovanovitch said she was \"shocked, appalled, devastated\" when she learned in September that Trump in a July 25 call to Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky described her as \"bad news.\"\n\nShe said she found the charge startling because she did nothing to undermine U.S. interests under Trump.\n\n\nTrump's tweets intimidated her\nTrump has tweeted his criticism of the inquiry dozens of times since the impeachment process began several weeks ago. But his scorching tweets during Yovanovitch's testimony took center stage at one point.\n\nA little more than an hour into the testimony, Democratic staff displayed two of the tweets on large screens in the hearing room as Schiff read them aloud:\n\n\"I don't think I have such powers,\" Yovanovitch said when Schiff asked for her reaction to the tweets. \"It's very intimidating.\"\n\n\"I want you to know that some of us here take witness intimidation very very seriously,\" Schiff responded.\n\nLethal aid under Trump helped Ukraine\nYovanovitch described as \"really positive\" and \"really generous\" that, at the urging of the Trump administration, Congress approved hundreds of millions in military assistance.\n\nMuch of that money was for Javelins, portable anti-tank missiles.\n\n\"So if the war with Russia all of a sudden accelerated in some way and tanks come over the horizon, javelins are a very serious weapon to deal with that,\" she told lawmakers when asked by Republican Counsel Steve Castor about the importance of the aid. \"But really the more important issue is the symbolism of it, that the United States is providing javelins to Ukraine and that makes Ukraine's adversaries think twice.\"\n\nThe delivery of lethal aid, rejected under Obama, has been a steady talking point from Republicans who said Trump acted to help the Eastern European country in its war with Russia when the previous administration wouldn't.\n\nBut Yovanovitch also criticized the mixed signals sent by the Trump administration's hold-up of the aid, a 55-day period earlier this year that stretched from July 18 to Sept. 11.\n\n\"When there are questions as to whether or not our security assistance is going to go through, that kind of undermines that strong message of support,\" she said.\n\nDemocrats emphasized her integrity\nMuch like they did with Wednesday's witnesses, Bill Taylor and George Kent, Democrats made a point of stressing the integrity of Yovanovitch, a career diplomat whose Ukraine posting was her third stint as an ambassador.\n\nIntelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, D-Calif., praised Yovanovitch during her 33 years in the State Department for earning a reputation for fighting corruption and naming names. She had arrived in the United States after her parents fled the Soviet Union and Nazi Germany, Schiff said. But Yovanovitch was recalled in April, despite being offered an extension of her tour by the State Department, and told President Donald Trump had lost confidence in her, Schiff said.\n\nFirst hearing:New revelations, steady witnesses, Trump tweets: takeaways from the first public hearing on impeachment\n\n\"It was a stunning turn of events for this highly regarded career diplomat, who had been doing such a remarkable job fighting corruption in Ukraine that a short time earlier she had been asked by the State Department to extend her tour,\" Schiff said.\n\n\"All Americans are deeply in your debt,\" Schiff later told her.\n\nNo evidence Ukraine meddled in 2016 elections\nYovanovitch also tried to swat down claims by Republicans that Ukraine was at the heart of a foreign interference campaign in the 2016 election aimed at hurting Trump's election.\n\n\"Our own U.S. Intelligence Community has conclusively determined that those who interfered in the (2016) election were in Russia,\" she told lawmakers.\n\nRussia's aggressive meddling, including its efforts to help \u2013 not hurt \u2013 Trump, was well documented in special counsel Robert Mueller's report on Russian election meddling that came out earlier this year.\n\nYovanovitch said that Ukrainian officials who criticized Trump during the 2016 election did not constitute a \"plan or a plot\" against him.\n\n\"They're isolated incidents,\" Yovanovitch said.\n\nRepublicans: inquiry elbowing out priorities\nEchoing a familiar mantra, Republicans said the impeachment inquiry is stymieing Congress' work on a range of issues including trade agreements and avoiding a government shutdown.\n\n\"It's unfortunate that today and for most of next week we will continue engaging in the Democrats' day-long TV spectacles instead of solving the problems we were all sent to Washington to address,\" California Rep. Devin Nunes, the top Republican on the committee, said.\n\n\"We now have a major trade agreement with Canada and Mexico ready for approval, a deal that would create jobs and boost our economy,\" he continued. \"Meanwhile, we have not yet approved funding for the government, which expires next week. along with funding for our men and women in uniform. Instead, the Democrats have convened us once again to advance their operation to topple a duly elected president.\"\n\nDemocrats who control the House say the criticism is hollow considering the House has passed \u2013 and keeps passing \u2013 important legislation, such as bills to help veterans, that the GOP-run Senate refuses to take up.\n\nAnd House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said the impeachment inquiry isn't stopping the House from working on trade agreements, prescription drug prices and efforts to keep the government open.\n\n\"So as I say, we legislate.  We investigate ... But we litigate,\" she told reporters Thursday.\n\nU.S. foreign to Ukraine improved under Trump\n"

        "text": "The always-heated topic of abortion restrictions will be front and center Tuesday, as lawmakers appear poised to move forward with a measure that in the past has failed to gain traction in the Florida Senate.\n\nThe proposal (SB 404), sponsored by Sen. Kelli Stargel, R-Lakeland, would require parental consent before minors can have abortions. The measure goes beyond current Florida law, which requires parents to be notified before minors can have the procedure.\n\nThe Senate, traditionally viewed as the more moderate of the two legislative chambers, didn't pass a parental-consent bill during the 2019 session, after the House readily endorsed the idea.\n\nBut the proposal is back for the 2020 session, and the House is positioned to approve its parental-consent bill after the session starts in January. And in an election year in which Republicans are eager to boost President Donald Trump's re-election chances in critical swing-state Florida, the proposal has the endorsement of Senate President Bill Galvano, R-Bradenton.\n\nAlso, with Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis appointing three conservative justices to the Florida Supreme Court early this year, a parental-consent requirement could get a green light from the court, which previously has thwarted abortion restrictions.\n\nPeople on both sides of the abortion issue are gearing up for a showdown Tuesday, as the Senate Health Policy Committee takes up the proposal.\n\nJohn Stemberger, president and general counsel of the conservative group Florida Family Action, sent an email alert to supporters encouraging them to attend the meeting, noting \"there is only 90 minutes allotted to this topic and we need you to come out and speak in favor.\"\n\nStemberger also advised supporters who don't want to speak to simply show up wearing blue.\n\nAbortion-rights advocates, meanwhile, plan a rally and march Tuesday at the Capitol to oppose what they have dubbed the \"Trojan horse\" abortion bill. That description stems from comments Sen. Dennis Baxley made during an August appearance at a Christian Family Coalition event.\n\nBaxley, a conservative Republican from Ocala, indicated that the parental-consent measure could provide an opportunity for the revamped court to take \"another look at what the privacy clause means.\" The Supreme Court in the past has rejected abortion restrictions based on the privacy clause in the state Constitution.\n\n\"I contend on the issue of parents taking responsibility of their children that parental consent is an easy argument for us,\" Baxley told the crowd, adding the outcome of the parental consent case \"could open the door for many other accomplishments that save lives.\"\n"

Violation of this policy is not tolerated.\"\n\nThe Associated Press, which first published about Murphy, reported that most politicians who made a claim about Murphy requested anonymity to speak freely about the issue.\n\nTom Courtney, a former Democratic state senator from Burlington who's running for reelection to his old seat, told the AP that a Steyer aide made him an offer but he declined to name Murphy.\n\n\"Tom, I know you're running for Senate. I'm working for Tom Steyer,\" Courtney recalled about the aide. \"Now you know how this works. \u2026 He said, 'You help them, and they'll help you.'\"\n\nOne current lawmaker, Rep. Karin Derry of Johnston, said Murphy didn't explicitly offer a specific dollar amount, but made it clear she would receive financial support.\n\n\"It was presented more as, he has provided financial support to other down-ballot candidates who've endorsed him, and could do the same for you,\" she told the AP.\n\nThere's no evidence that any of the politicians allegedly approached by Murphy accepted the offer or received contributions from Steyer's campaign, according to the AP.\n\nA campaign spokesman for Steyer told the AP that the ex-speaker had not been authorized to offer money and that campaign leadership outside of the Iowa operations had been unaware of his actions.\n\nMurphy later issued a statement through the campaign that said he understands \"how tricky the endorsement process can be for folks in Iowa.\"\n\n\"It was never my intention to make my former colleagues uncomfortable, and I apologize for any miscommunication on my part,\" he said in the statement.\n\nPayments for endorsements, if not disclosed by a campaign, would violate federal campaign finance laws. Separately, Iowa law prohibits state and local candidate committees from accepting contributions from federal candidate committees.\n\nSteyer has received the endorsement of just one Iowan since entering the race in July \u2014 former state Rep. Roger Thomas of Elkader.\n\nIn a statement provided by Steyer's campaign, Thomas said that he endorsed Steyer \"because he's the outsider who can deliver for Iowans on the issues that matter most: getting corporate corruption out of our politics and putting forth a rural agenda that revitalizes communities across Iowa.\"\n\nThomas' endorsement was issued in October after the close of the most recent campaign finance reporting period, which ended Sept. 30. The campaign finance disclosure Steyer filed offered no indication that he directly gave Thomas any money.\n\nHargreaves with the Steyer campaign said Steyer's endorsements come from \"his consistent efforts engaging communities, meeting them where they are, and earning their trust and respect with his unifying messages.\"\n\n\"The campaign will continue to seek them in Iowa and other parts of the country,\" she said.\n\nSteyer, a billionaire activist who has mostly self-funded his quest for the Democratic nomination for president, has faced criticism that he's trying to buy his way into the White House. He spent $47.6 million of his own money in the first three months since launching his bid. At the time of his announcement, he said he planned to spend \"at least $100 million\" on the race.\n\nSteyer appeared on the stage of the Democratic primary debate in October and he has qualified for the debate scheduled later this month.\n"

        "text": "The first public presidential impeachment hearing in over 20 years is set to be held before the House Intelligence Committee on Wednesday, with witnesses Democrats believe will bring to life allegations that President Donald Trump has abused the power of the presidency.\nThe witnesses will emphasize the \"simple abuse of power case\" and illustrate the damage that abuse has caused, multiple sources have told NBC News. Republican lawmakers are expected to focus on the witnesses' lack of direct interaction with the president while giving credence to a debunked conspiracy theory that it was Ukraine and not Russia that meddled in the 2016 presidential election.\nWhen does the hearing start?\nThe hearing is set to start at 10 a.m. Wednesday. House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, D-Calif., will make an opening statement, followed by an opening statement by the ranking Republican on the committee, Rep. Devin Nunes of California, and then statements from the two witnesses.\nWho's testifying?\nThe witnesses testifying Wednesday are Bill Taylor, the Trump administration's top diplomat in Ukraine, and George Kent, deputy assistant secretary of state for European and Eurasian affairs.\nIn his closed-door deposition, Taylorsaid he threatened to quit after he was told Trump was withholding hundreds of millions of dollars in aid to Ukraine because he wanted \"investigations.\" He texted another diplomat that \"it's crazy to withhold security assistance for help with a political campaign.\"\nKent told investigators in his deposition that he'd raised concerns that Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani was poisoning Ukraine policy with \"a campaign of lies\" \u2014 and was warned to \"lay low\" by his boss afterward.\nThe two will testify together side-by-side at the witness table.\nWho's doing the questioning?\nSchiff and Nunes will have 45 minutes each to question witnesses in the first part of the hearing. They can also delegate the questioning to a committee lawyer instead, which Schiff has indicated he'll do.\nSchiff will determine if there is a need for an additional 90 minute staff round or to move on to lawmaker questions.\nOnce the staff question round or rounds conclude, the format will revert to one similar to a traditional congressional hearing, with lawmakers getting five minutes each to ask questions.\nWho's on the committee?\nThere are 13 Democrats and nine Republicans. The Democrats include Schiff, former presidential candidate Eric Swalwell of California and Joaquin Castro of Texas, the brother of presidential candidate Juli\u00e1n Castro. The other Democrats are Jim Himes of Connecticut, Terri Sewell of Alabama, Andre Carson of Indiana, Jackie Speier of California, Mike Quigley of Illinois, Denny Heck of Washington, Peter Welch of Vermont, Sean Patrick Maloney of New York, Val Demings of Florida and Raja Krishnamoorthi of Illinois.\nOn the Republican side are top Trump allies Nunes, John Ratcliffe of Texas and Jim Jordan of Ohio, who was added to the committee just last week. Also on the Republican side are Michael Turner and Brad Wenstrup of Ohio, Chris Stewart of Utah and Elise Stefanik of New York. Rounding out the roster are Mike Conaway and sometimes-Trump critic Will Hurd of Texas, both of whom have announced they are not running for re-election.\nThe hearing is set to take place in the House Ways and Means Committee hearing room because the Intelligence Committee doesn't have its own hearing room. The room is the same one where Hillary Clinton testified before the Benghazi Committee for more than eight hours in 2015.\nWhat to expect from each side\nHimes told Chuck Todd on Sunday's \"Meet the Press\" that the public will \"hear immensely patriotic, beautifully articulate people telling the story of a president who ... extorted a vulnerable country by holding up military aid.\"\nRepublicans are likely to focus on the fact that much of Taylor and Kent's information about what Trump was and was not doing came from other people, not from their direct interactions with the president. Some of those people \u2014 including acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney and former national security adviser John Bolton \u2014 have refused to cooperate with the probe.\nRepublicans are also expected to stress that it's not believed that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy was aware that Trump had placed a hold on almost $400 million in aid to his country during their July 25 phone conversation. During Taylor's deposition, which was released to the public last week, Nunes also used his questioning to suggest that Ukraine was behind the hacking of the Democratic National Committee and not Russia, the country U.S. intelligence agencies have unanimously agreed was the culprit.\nHow long will the hearing take?\nTBD, but it's expected to wrap up between 2:30 and 4:30 p.m., barring any extra questioning or Republican stalling tactics.\nWhere can you watch?\nNBC News will air a special report at 10 a.m. ET led by \"NBC Nightly News anchor\" Lester Holt, NBC News chief legal correspondent Savannah Guthrie and NBC News political director Chuck Todd. MSNBC will anchor special coverage hosted by \"The 11th Hour\" host Brian Williams and \"Deadline: White House\" host Nicolle Wallace.\nThe hearings will be streamed live on NBC News NOW, NBCNews.com and MSNBC.com. NBCnews.com will also feature a live blog with contributors from across NBC News with news, fact checks and analysis. The coverage will be collected at NBCNews.com/impeachment.\nAre more hearings scheduled?\nFormer Ukraine Ambassador Marie Yovanovitch is scheduled to testify before the same committee on Friday. Schiff said in a letter to his colleagues Tuesday that additional witnesses will be announced by the end of the week.\n"

ICE is not the problem,\" the former vice president told reporters Friday afternoon in Concord, New Hampshire. \"The policies behind ICE are the problem, and that's easy enough to fix if the president knows what he or she is doing.\"\n\nBiden's comments were in response to a question about Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders' new immigration plan, which calls for defunding ICE and granting a number of government benefits for illegal immigrants.\n\nLeft-wing critics of President Trump's immigration policies have called for dismantling the agency since February 2017, citing what they see as human rights abuses being committed under its watch.\n\nProminent elected officials within the Democratic Party, including a number of Biden's 2020 rivals, have endorsed the \"Abolish ICE\" movement.

        "text": "U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders and U.S. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez drew more than 2,000 people to Drake University on Saturday to hear them rail against the climate crisis and the oil companies they blame for it, and promote their \"Green New Deal.\"\n\nBut first, the audience sat through a slideshow. It was created by a climate scientist, showing graphs and numbers highlighting the loss of the Arctic ice sheet and increasing carbon dioxide levels, and the precarious balance of \"spaceship Earth's\" life support system. It was far from a typical start to a political rally fewer than 90 days from Iowa's first-in-the-nation presidential-nominating caucuses.\n\nThe big cheers and applause came later in the Des Moines event. Ocasio-Cortez's entrance was greeted by a sea of cellphones popping out to take photos and videos \u2014 evidence of the enthusiasm her political celebrity brought to the swing. She greeted the crowd in turn by asking who was ready for a \"Green New Deal.\"\n\nSaturday's \"Climate Crisis Summit,\" a centerpiece of Sanders' swing with the New York congresswoman, wasn't a traditional campaign rally. Before the politicians' keynote speeches, a panel of local and national activists spoke about problems and solutions for climate change. Sanders' campaign announced last week that it was refocusing its Iowa effort around climate change. It branded its events with Ocasio-Cortez around the \"Green New Deal.\"\n\nUnited States Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) speaks on Saturday, Nov. 9, 2019, at Drake University in Des Moines.\nOcasio-Cortez is a lead sponsor of the \"Green New Deal,\" a comprehensive bill to remake the economy around fighting climate change. Sanders has adopted a similar proposal in his campaign \u2014 an estimated $16.3 trillion effort that would create 20 million jobs, lead to a 100% renewable-energy-powered electric system and a 100% electric transportation system by 2030, according to the campaign. It would also remake much of the agricultural industry toward small farms and away from large agribusiness operations.\n\n\"When it comes to a Green New Deal, it's always, always a question of how we're going to pay for it,\" Ocasio-Cortez said, being drowned out by a standing ovation. \"\u2026 As if we're not paying for it right now, with half the Midwest under water, as if Hurricane Katrina and Maria didn't happen, as if sea levels weren't rising, as if California wasn't on fire. How do we pay for that?\"\n\nOcasio-Cortez was a key reason Wes Wierson, a genome scientist, attended the summit Saturday, he said. He's heard her in 30-second snippets on the news but wanted to hear her in person and at length. But the focus on climate was itself noteworthy, he said.\n\n\"Without the planet, none of the other issues really matter,\" he said.\n\nThat echoed a sentiment made by Sanders himself. In his speech, Sanders noted that his \"Green New Deal\" has a hefty price tag, \"but I want you to tell me what the alternative is to saving the planet.\"\n\n\"I wish from the bottom of my heart, I really do, that I could tell you we don't need aggressive unprecedented action,\" Sanders said. \"... but if I told you that, I'd be lying to you, and I'd be betraying my kids, my seven grandchildren, and future generations.\"\n\nIowa has faced climate-change-induced harm already, Sanders argued. Historic precipitation caused billions of dollars in damage through floods, topsoil loss and more.\n\nThe activists who spoke framed Sanders' proposal as the most ambitious policy to avert a climate crisis. It featured a national leader with the Sunrise Movement, a direct-action protest movement that's taken credit for pushing all the candidates for the Democratic presidential nomination to adopt a climate plan and CNN to host a seven-hour series of town hall events earlier in the race. Sanders also credited the group's efforts from the lectern.\n\nThe Sunrise Movement has also taken shots at other candidates, notably former Vice President Joe Biden. A week before Sanders' climate summit, about 10 Sunrise Movement protesters interrupted Biden at a Des Moines campaign office opening and unfurled a black and gold banner reading \"BIDEN BOUGHT OUT BY BIG OIL.\"\n\nThe protesters also filmed a video at September's Polk County Steak Fry where an activist urges him to embrace the \"Green New Deal\" and accuses him of breaking a pledge not to accept money from fossil fuel executives.\n\nU.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders addresses a crowd in Council Bluffs, Ia., on Friday, Nov. 8, 2019, after being introduced by U.S. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez\nOn Friday in Council Bluffs, Ocasio-Cortez helped the Sanders campaign claim a record 2020 turnout for an Iowa event. More than 2,400 people filled an Iowa Western Community College arena to hear the two.\n\nThe crowd in Council Bluffs was estimated at about 100 more than the figure cited by South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg's campaign for his audience a week earlier at the Iowa Democratic Party's Liberty and Justice Dinner. Both audiences could have included many non-Iowans \u2014 the dinner draws supporters from all over the country, and Council Bluffs is just across the Missouri River from Omaha, Nebraska.\n\n\"We need to stitch this movement together, bit by bit, stitch by stitch, and that's how we're going to win,\" Ocasio-Cortez told the crowd Friday, following a call to \"stitch together\" a cross-class and cross-demographic coalition. \"\u2026 That's not just how we're going to win a Bernie Sanders presidency, but that's how we're going to win our future back. That's how we're going to win our country back. That's how we're going to win it all.\"\n\n\"I love her,\" Hannah Cook, a 20-year-old student from nearby Glenwood, Iowa, said after the event, slumping her shoulders and rolling her eyes up for emphasis. \"I was so excited when I saw that (Ocasio-Cortez was going to be here).\"\n\nCook and her friend Kelsey Pavelka said they both probably would have come out regardless of Ocasio-Cortez's presence. But the freshman congresswoman, and youngest woman ever elected to the U.S. Congress, brought a new energy, they said.\n\nThis story has been updated to include information from Saturday's event.\n\nNick Coltrain is a politics and data reporter for the Register.

        "title": "Under indictment, Philly Councilman Bobby Henon faces two challengers for majority leader",
        "text": "With Tuesday's general election behind them, City Council members are now jockeying for leadership positions, contests that carry added intrigue this year thanks to the indictment of Majority Leader Bobby Henon, two vacancies in other top posts, and several members' ambitions of becoming mayor.\n\nHenon, who has pleaded not guilty to federal charges in the case centered on alleged corruption within the Electricians Local 98 union, said recently that he intends to keep the chamber's No. 2 job.\n\nCouncil members Cherelle Parker and Curtis Jones Jr., however, are seeking support from Democratic colleagues to try to unseat Henon, according to Councilwoman Maria Qui?ones-S\u00e1nchez.\n\nThe retirement of Majority Whip Blondell Reynolds Brown and Deputy Whip Bill Greenlee will also leave room at the top.\n\nThe only outcome seen as a certainty in the leadership contests, which will be decided when members are sworn in for their four-year terms in January, is the reelection of Darrell L. Clarke for a third term as Council president.\n\nAside from the Council president, to whom the city's Home Rule Charter gives immense power, the positions are largely symbolic. If the president has a good relationship with the leaders, they wield influence. If not, they can be easily sidelined.\n\n\"The Council president has all of the power ... and is under no obligation to include anyone if he doesn't want to,\" City Hall lobbyist John Hawkins said.\n\nThe elections, however, can illuminate the ever-shifting factions on Council and can have consequences for how the body operates. Members trying to win support from colleagues, for instance, often promise to pay them back with future favors.\n\nThe posts also come with pay raises: $2,000 to $9,000 on top of members' $131,000 base salary.\n\nJones' challenge to Henon is in a sense a redo of the 2015 leadership race, in which Henon ousted Jones as majority leader after Jones had a falling-out with Clarke.\n\nNow Henon is the one struggling to hold on to political capital, while Jones has striven to rebuild his clout in the chamber.\n\nFew members have openly criticized Henon, the former political director of Local 98, which spends heavily in Philadelphia and statewide races. After Henon, union boss John J. Dougherty, and six others related to the union were indicted in January, no Council member called for his resignation. At the time, however, three close allies of Clarke's who will leave office in January \u2014 Brown, Greenlee, and Councilwoman Jannie Blackwell \u2014 suggested that Henon's role would be reconsidered.\n\nIn September, Qui?ones-S\u00e1nchez became the first member to call for Henon's resignation. On Friday, she reiterated her hope that he will be replaced as majority leader.\n\n\"My interest is to have a team that works together and respects the independence of the members,\" she said.\n\nHenon appears to have the backing of progressive Councilwoman Helen Gym, who told The Inquirer on Election Day that she considered him \"a good majority leader.\"\n\nParker, meanwhile, is an ally of Mayor Jim Kenney's and is frequently mentioned as a potential candidate to replace him in the 2023 election.\n\nShe is also a product of the Northwest Coalition, the influential political organization led by former Councilwoman Marian Tasco and U.S. Rep. Dwight Evans (D., Phila.) that could benefit her as she tries to round up votes. Both she and Councilman Derek Green are Tasco proteges.\n\nJones, who represents West Philadelphia, hails from the political family founded by former U.S. Rep. Chaka Fattah, who is serving a 10-year sentence on federal corruption charges. He will look for support from Councilwoman Cindy Bass, another Fattah alum.\n\nHenon, Parker, and Jones did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nCouncil's three incoming Democratic members \u2014 Isaiah Thomas, Kathy Gilmore Richardson, and Jamie Gauthier \u2014 could play a critical role.\n\nIt's unclear whether the other newcomer, Kendra Brooks of the progressive Working Families Party, will get to vote for majority leader or minority leader. Current rules for leadership elections do not contemplate the possibility of a third-party member, but the new Council can amend them when it convenes in January.\n\nThe freshmen face a choice that could define the start of their careers: Will one of their first votes be to elect an indicted majority leader? Will their support for one candidate anger other factions?\n\nThomas on Thursday declined to comment on the leadership race, saying he had expected it to be resolved without the newcomers' involvement.\n\n\"That's something I was hoping they would figure out,\" Thomas said.\n\nThe current minority leader is Brian O'Neill, one of three Republicans on Council. But with fellow GOP Councilman Al Taubenberger being unseated by Brooks, O'Neill's only Republican colleague come January will be David Oh.\n\nOh, however, said Friday that he doesn't plan to vote for O'Neill for the leadership post, and raised the possibility that there might not be one next session.\n\n\"I think that [Brooks] doesn't want it, I don't want it, and I suppose that [O'Neill] might want it or not, but it doesn't matter because he won't have the votes,\" Oh said. \"I don't know that we need a minority leader because a minority leader's job is to lead the minority party, and there isn't a minority party. There are minority parties.\"\n"

The judges, all of whom were Democratic appointees, refused to rule on Trump's broader claims that a sitting president cannot be personally charged with a crime, but they said that any immunity he has does not allow him to block a subpoena of a third party.\n\n\"There is no obvious reason why a state could not begin to investigate a President during his term and, with the information secured during that search, ultimately determine to prosecute him after he leaves office,\" the panel wrote."

        "text": "U.S. President Donald Trump and some Republican lawmakers are pushing for political and media allies to reveal the name of the whistleblower who prompted an impeachment inquiry.\n\n\"The whistleblower should be revealed because the whistleblower gave false information,\" Trump told reporters on Sunday.\n\nRand Paul, a Republican senator from Kentucky, on Tuesday tweeted a link to an article from a right-wing news outlet that claims to have identified the whistleblower. On Wednesday, the president's son, Donald Trump Jr., tweeted a link to an article including the same name.\n\nDemocrats, some Republicans, and members of the U.S. intelligence community have strongly objected to the effort, calling it everything from inappropriate to illegal.\n\nHere is what U.S. law says about how whistleblowers in the intelligence community should file complaints, and the punishments for retaliation and identification.\n\nWHAT STEPS DID THE WHISTLEBLOWER TAKE?\nOn Aug. 12, the whistleblower lodged a complaint with an internal government watchdog about a July 25 phone call between Trump and Ukraine's new president Volodymyr Zelenskiy. During that call, Trump pressed his Ukrainian counterpart to investigate a political rival, former Vice President Joe Biden, and his son Hunter Biden.\n\nThe whistleblower filed the report with Intelligence Community Inspector General Michael Atkinson, as required under the Intelligence Community Whistleblower Protection Act of 1998 (ICWPA here), which lays out procedures for reporting allegations of fraud, waste, or violations of law.\n\nAtkinson determined the complaint was credible and involved an urgent concern, and shared it with Acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire on Aug. 26, as required under the ICWPA.\n\nThe ICWPA requires the director to report any complaint to Congressional intelligence committees within seven days. Maguire consulted with the White House, and the report was sent to prescribed members of Congress on Sept. 25.\n\nMaguire found the complaint did not meet the legal definition of \"urgent concern.\" But it has since prompted a House of Representatives investigation into whether Trump committed \"high crimes and misdemeanors\" warranting impeachment.\n\nJohn Cohen, a former official in the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, said the whistleblower followed the procedures laid out in the ICWPA, and that much of the whistleblower's complaint has been corroborated.\n\nWHAT DOES U.S. LAW SAY ABOUT REVEALING A WHISTLEBLOWER'S NAME?\n\nThere is only one provision in the ICWPA that deals specifically with whistleblower anonymity, said Kel McClanahan, a national security lawyer in Washington.\n\nThat provision says the inspector general should not disclose the whistleblower's identity without their consent, unless the watchdog determines that \"such disclosure is unavoidable during the course of the investigation.\"\n\nOnce the complaint is out of the inspector general's hands the law does little to guarantee the whistleblower anonymity, said McClanahan, the executive director of National Security Counselors, a public interest law firm.\n\n\"It is presumed that people would want to not publicly expose a whistleblower because of all the public policy reasons for not doing so,\" said McClanahan.\n\nMembers of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence who reveal the whistleblower's identity could violate that committee's rules and face censure from fellow lawmakers, McClanahan said. Censure is largely symbolic, however, and does not remove a House member from office.\n\nThe whistleblower's lawyers said in a statement on Wednesday that efforts to identify their client \"will place that individual and their family at risk of serious harm\" and will deter future whistleblowers.\n\nWHAT OTHER PROTECTIONS DOES U.S. LAW PROVIDE TO INTELLIGENCE COMMUNITY WHISTLEBLOWERS?\n\nA 2012 directive here from former President Barack Obama, formally put into law in 2014, supplemented the ICWPA to protect intelligence community whistleblowers from some forms of retaliation, including termination or security clearance revocation, if they follow rules for making disclosures.\n\nThere are limits to the law's protections, however. Unlike other whistleblowers in the federal government, intelligence community whistleblowers are not permitted to file lawsuits over any perceived retaliation. Instead, they must pursue relief through an internal review process.\n\nNotably, the 2014 law ultimately puts the president in charge of enforcing the whistleblower protections.\n\nCohen, now a professor at Georgetown University, said the law was primarily intended to protect whistleblowers from workplace retaliation by colleagues and supervisors.\n\n\"It does not necessarily prevent disclosure of the identity of the whistleblower, which may subject the individual to retaliation from others,\" Cohen said.\n\nWHAT SECURITY PROTECTIONS DOES THE U.S. FEDERAL GOVERNMENT PROVIDE A INTELLIGENCE COMMUNITY EMPLOYEE WHO IS TARGETED FOR WHISTLEBLOWING?\n\nObama's directive gave intelligence community whistleblowers some protections against workplace retaliation, but does not provide them with security guards or similar protections.\n\nHouse members have considered \"extreme measures\" to protect the whistleblower's identity in the event the individual testifies, including disguising their face and voice, CNN reported.\n\nLawyers for the whistleblower say they have received death threats after conservative media outlets have floated possible names.\n\nIS THERE ARE ANY HISTORICAL PRECEDENT FOR THIS MOMENT?\nNot really. Many government employees and contractors who have gone public with allegations of wrongdoing went directly to the press.\n\n\"I do not think I have ever seen a president, his allies in Congress and even his family work this hard to publicly disclose the name of a whistleblower who has followed the law,\" said Cohen.\n\n\"Its disturbing - particularly in light of the fact that the concerns raised by the whistleblower have for the most part been validated by witnesses with first hand knowledge,\" Cohen said.\n"

        "text": "Social media posts distort the facts around an 11-year-old, dismissed DUI charge against Rep. Matt Gaetz. They also leave the false impression that he \"stole from dying people.\"\n\nFull Story \nPosts about Rep. Matt Gaetz circulating on social media in recent days bend the facts to argue that the Florida Republican is part of the so-called \"swamp.\"\n\n\"Republican Matt Gaetz has had numerous DUIs and his dad got him off each time,\" read the Facebook posts, accompanied by a mugshot of Gaetz. \"He was part of a company that had to pay 75 million in hospice fraud. They stole from dying people. He is the swamp.\"\n\nLike many claims that gain traction on social media, the posts have some factual basis but are muddied by misrepresentation, exaggeration and speculation. We'll start with the first part.\n\nCourt records and press reports show that Gaetz was arrested once, in 2008, on charges that he was driving while intoxicated \u2014 but the case was later dismissed, the Okaloosa County court docket shows. In other words, he was never convicted.\n\nThe posts offer no evidence that Gaetz has \"had numerous DUIs,\" or that his father, Don, a Florida state senator from 2006 to 2016, \"got him off each time.\"\n\nHere's what we know about the 2008 case: Gaetz, 26 at the time, was arrested in October 2008 while driving home from a nightclub \u2014 ironically, called the Swamp \u2014 on Florida's Okaloosa Island, according to the Tampa Bay Times. In reviewing the matter in 2014, the newspaper wrote:\n\nTampa Bay Times, Feb. 18, 2014: Near midnight, Okaloosa County Deputy Chris Anglin clocked Gaetz going 48 in a 35 mph zone. Anglin later reported that Gaetz fumbled for his license and registration, his eyes were watery and bloodshot, and he swayed and staggered when he got out of the car.\n\nSmelling alcohol, Anglin asked Gaetz if he had been drinking. Gaetz replied no. Minutes later, he admitted he had consumed two beers. Twice, Anglin conducted an eye test. Twice, Gaetz's eyes didn't follow the prompt.\n\nGaetz, who had recently begun practicing law, declined any field sobriety tests. He was arrested and refused the breath test.\n\nWeeks after the arrest, Anglin, the officer who arrested Gaetz, reportedly resigned amid several alleged infractions, including that he used excessive force against another DUI suspect soon after Gaetz's arrest.\n\nAfter Anglin quit, \"the prosecutor asked to be taken off the case, because his stepson was friends with Gaetz. Then-Gov. Charlie Crist's office assigned the case to Steve Meadows, the state attorney for the neighboring circuit,\" according to the Tampa Bay Times.\n\nGaetz's defense attorney, Drew Pinkerton, filed a motion to dismiss the case that December. According to a report at the time from the Northwest Florida Daily News, the defense claimed that Gaetz had answered \"no\" to the officer's question about whether he had too much to drink \u2014 not to whether he had anything to drink. Gaetz also claimed in an interview with that newspaper that he was not swerving and that the officer had said threatening things to him.\n\nThe 2014 Tampa Bay Times report continued:\n\nTampa Bay Times, Feb. 18, 2014: Less than a week later, Gaetz had his driver's license reinstated. A field officer for the Department of Highway Safety and Motor Vehicles declared there was no evidence that Gaetz refused a breath test. Yet the refusal was clearly documented in Anglin's affidavit and arrest report.\n\nIt even was documented in Pinkerton's Dec. 18 motion to dismiss charges against Gaetz.\n\nThis three-page document, which Gaetz signed, states there was no evidence that he had been impaired. There was no mention of many of Anglin's observations suggesting that Gaetz was impaired.\n\nIt added a new detail: \"A civilian witness drove by who knew (Gaetz) and observed no indication of impairment.\"\n\nYet the witness was not named, either in Pinkerton's document or other case records at the Okaloosa County Clerk's Office. Still, this anonymous testimony is all that contradicted Anglin's conclusion that there was probable cause to arrest Gaetz on DUI.\n\nMeadows accepted Pinkerton's motion and agreed to drop the case on Dec. 22, 2008.\n\nSo, in short, we know that after the arresting officer quit amid internal allegations of improprieties and after the initial prosecutor transferred the case to avoid a conflict of interest, the new prosecutor dropped the case. There has been no evidence put forward to substantiate the claim that Gaetz's \"dad got him off.\"\n\nAnd while we found numerous traffic violations, such as speeding tickets, against Gaetz in Okaloosa County, we did not find any other cases in which Gaetz was charged with a DUI to support the contention that he has had \"numerous DUIs.\"\n\nA spokesperson for Gaetz told FactCheck.org that it was \"categorically false\" to say the congressman had \"multiple\" DUI arrests, adding that Gaetz had \"never been convicted of a DUI.\"\n\nGaetz has acknowledged the arrest in public before: In 2014, while chairing a criminal justice subcommittee in the Florida House of Representatives, he talked about his booking photo's presence online.\n\n\"If anyone Googles my name, the first image that will appear is my mugshot from my arrest,\" he said. \"And I'm of the view that that is part of who I am. I made bad decisions and [that] resulted in arrest and that is sort of something that we all live with.\"\n\nClaim of \u2018Hospice Fraud'\nFollowing the unsubstantiated claim of \"numerous DUIs,\" the social media posts continue: \"He was part of a company that had to pay 75 million in hospice fraud. They stole from dying people.\" As the post is structured, readers may interpret \"he\" to reference Gaetz. In reality, the claim relates to a company his father founded and later sold.\n\nIn 2017, Chemed Corporation and \"various wholly-owned subsidiaries, including Vitas Hospice Services LLC and Vitas Healthcare Corporation\" agreed to pay $75 million to settle federal charges that the companies submitted false claims for hospice services to Medicare, according to the U.S. Department of Justice. \n\nVitas \u2014 which the Justice Department identified as \"the largest for-profit hospice chain\" in the U.S. \u2014 was co-founded by Don Gaetz. Rep. Matt Gaetz's spokesperson said the congressman was never employed by Vitas.\n\nFederal prosecutors claimed that \"between 2002 and 2013 Vitas knowingly submitted or caused to be submitted false claims to Medicare for services to hospice patients who were not terminally ill.\" (Although the posts say \"they stole from dying people,\" the company was accused of defrauding Medicare.)\n\nThe lawsuit against the company was filed in 2013 \u2014 nine years after Don Gaetz sold the company to Chemed in 2004. It's true that at least some of the instances were alleged to have occurred before that sale date (dating back to 2002), but it's worth noting that Don Gaetz was not a party to the lawsuit. At the time of the lawsuit's filing, he denied that the matters in the complaint related to his work with Vitas.\n\nThe elder Gaetz told the Northwest Florida Daily News that he was active in management until 2000. \"I told my partners I was interested in becoming superintendent of schools, and when I got elected I said I was stepping back,\" he said. \"I gave up all management responsibilities in 2000, though I continued as a shareholder and attended about four board meetings a year.\"\n\nEditor's note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations working with Facebook to debunk misinformation shared on social media.

The other was the city's budget, which council failed to pass.\n\nThis week's meeting lasted nearly four hours.

        "text": "Some will watch, some will catch up via Fox News at night, and others will ignore the event entirely. But no matter what comes out at the public impeachment hearings that got underway Wednesday, President Donald Trump's fervent South Florida supporters say they won't waiver.\n\nTo them, the impeachment inquiry is a sham \u2014 a merit-less attempt by Democrats to damage Trump.\n\n\"It's a joke. All they do is make up lies,\" said Robert Korhonen, of Fort Lauderdale, one of about 100 people who attended the monthly Americans for Trump Broward meeting Tuesday night \u2014 in a county that's biggest Democratic stronghold in the state. \"It's just a big frigging waste of time and I think most Americans are smart enough to understand what's going on here.\"\n\nDemocrats, Korhonen added, are \"trying to throw as much crap against him as they can. Trump is not guilty of anything. He hasn't done anything wrong. They keep throwing crap and trying to trap him in stuff. But he's innocent. They got nothing. They got nothing.\"\n\nDavid Lhota of Plantation, a lawyer, said information that's come out in advance of the public hearings shows the president has done nothing wrong.\n\nDemocrats see it entirely differently, that there's proof Trump pressured the president of Ukraine to meddle in the 2020 election by coming up with dirt that would make Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden look bad. Lhota thinks Biden's dealings in Ukraine from his time as vice president are what should be investigated.\n\nWhat's going on now, he said, is \"a sham, a lot of propaganda. I think it's just a vehicle to try to persuade the public prior to the elections, throw a lot of mud. See what sticks. It's a complete hoax. It's disgusting. I think it's weakening our country. It's spreading lies.\"\n\n\"The election didn't turn out the way they wanted, and now they're trying to change the results,\" Lhota said. \"The only focus is on smearing the president's good name and I think people will see that. And in fact, I think it will backfire on the Democrats if they carry this out too long and keep trying to promote this propaganda.\"\n\nSofia Manolesco of Deerfield Beach, who works in the fitness industry, doesn't see the impeachment inquiry as serious. \"I think that most politicians are paid actors, and they just do what they need to do to ramp up public opinion and try to get people excited.\"\n\nAmericans for Trump attracts die-hard supporters of the president from Broward, Palm Beach and Miami-Dade counties. Raffle prizes between speakers included a \"border patrol kit\" and a \"build the wall kit.\" And U.S. Sen. Mitt Romney of Utah, the only senator somewhat critical of Trump, was labeled a \"rat\" and an \"enemy.\" Romney was the 2012 Republican presidential nominee.\n\nThe Trump club is something of a refuge for his supporters in overwhelmingly Democratic South Florida. \"You feel good among people that think the same way,\" said Maria Canosa, a retiree from Tamarac.\n\nBut Canosa, Korhonen and Lhota have plenty of company among Trump supporters elsewhere in Florida \u2014 and their energy is critical to the president's hope for re-election. Florida awards 29 of the 270 electoral votes needed to win the presidency \u2014 more than any of the half-dozen swing states that will decide the 2020 election.\n\nPolling a month ago from the New York Times Upshot and Siena College found that 49% of Floridians support the impeachment inquiry, with 44% opposed \u2014 which shows the deep political divide in a state known for its extremely close elections.\n\nAmong Floridians who voted for Trump in 2016, Times/Siena poll found 16% supported the impeachment inquiry, and 81% were opposed. Among Hillary Clinton voters, 87% supported the impeachment inquiry and 8% opposed it.\n\nKorhonen, an artist, said \"most of the Democrats live in their own little bubble, their own little world, and they just don't get it. They're just so far off in lunacy world that they just don't get it.\"\n\nCanosa said the impeachment hearings are simply one more way that Democrats are attempting to undermine Trump.\n\n\"They have never given this man a fair shake,\" she said.\n\nAmericans for Trump president Scott Newmark, like most of the club members, expect the Democratic-controlled House to impeach the president and the Republican-controlled Senate to vote against convicting and removing him from office. \"It's like we're watching the movie in real time \u2014 but we know the ending.\"\n\nAnthony Man can be reached at aman@sunsentinel.com or on Twitter @browardpolitics\n"

        "title": "Bloomberg Heads to Arkansas to File for 2020 Presidential Primary",
        "text": "Bloomberg arrived in Little Rock, Arkansas, with a few aides, according to two people familiar with his activities. Arkansas is the second state in which he will be on the Democratic primary ballot, after qualifying to put his name on the ballot in Alabama last Friday. The two southern states both have early filing deadlines, even though they are not among the first primaries on the calendar.\n\n\"Mike wanted to go and do the filing himself,\" said Jason Schechter, a spokesman for Bloomberg. \"If he runs, he's going to go to states that Democrats never go to in the primary campaign. We're starting that today in Arkansas.\"\n\nBloomberg planned to have lunch at Sims BBQ with the mayor of Little Rock, Frank Scott Jr., during a brief visit to the city.\n\nBloomberg is considering a trip to North Carolina as soon as this week, two people briefed on his plans said. The state's filing deadline is not imminent, but similar to Arkansas it is among the Super Tuesday contests in early March that Bloomberg would aim to contest aggressively as a candidate.\n\nMichael John Gray, chairman of the Arkansas Democratic Party, said he had spoken briefly with Bloomberg in Little Rock on Tuesday morning. He said Bloomberg had recalled visiting the city during his time as mayor, for the opening of Bill Clinton's presidential library. Gray said there was \"a lot of buzz\" in the state capital about Bloomberg's visit, since Arkansas has only attracted visits from a few candidates so far in this campaign.\n\n\"I thanked him for being there in Arkansas,\" Gray said, suggesting Bloomberg could generate interest among voters beyond the traditional early-state circuit. \"You do that by showing up in places where people don't show up.\"\n\nOn Tuesday afternoon, in his first Twitter post related to a potential candidacy, Bloomberg trumpeted his trip to Arkansas.\n\nIn a further sign that Bloomberg is likely to run, one of his longtime lieutenants informed the Pete Buttigieg campaign that he could no longer back the South Bend, Indiana, mayor in a primary that included Bloomberg.\n\nBradley Tusk, Bloomberg's former campaign manager in New York, hosted a fundraiser for Buttigieg last month. But on Tuesday, Tusk said that while he still saw Buttigieg as an impressive candidate, circumstances had changed and he would be supporting Bloomberg in the presidential race.\n\nBloomberg, the former New York City mayor and billionaire media executive, is expected to make a final decision within days on whether to proceed with a presidential campaign. People close to him believe his mind is all but made up and his advisers have been recruiting potential campaign staff at a furious pace since the end of last week.\n\nBut Bloomberg has not yet made any formal announcement and there is at least a chance he could back away from the campaign.\n\nBloomberg is one of several prominent Democrats weighing a late entry into the 2020 campaign. Most serious besides Bloomberg is former Gov. Deval Patrick of Massachusetts, who could jump into the race as soon as this week.\n\nPatrick and his allies have been reaching out to Democrats in the early primary and caucus states, and Patrick spoke last week with former Vice President Joe Biden to tell him he was considering the race.\n\nThe former governor initially rejected making a White House bid last year, in part because his wife had received a cancer diagnosis, but she has been given a clean bill of health, according to Massachusetts Democrats.\n\nMoreover, Patrick believes nobody in the race has shown the promise of being able to both unify the party and heal a deeply divided country after the election. Democrats who have spoken to him say he envisions a campaign similar to that of his longtime friend, former President Barack Obama, which would focus more on bringing people together than making a particular ideological case.\n\nOne adviser to Patrick noted that, when he first ran for governor in 2006, his signature vow was that he'd be \"governor of the whole state\" and that he'd make a similar pledge to a fractured country.\n\nIt is a reflection of the unsettled nature of the Democratic race that both men may join the primary fray so late. But Patrick and Bloomberg would likely approach the campaign very differently, starting with their activities this week.\n\nIf Patrick runs, he is likely to file to become a candidate in New Hampshire before the deadline for entry there on Friday. Bloomberg, however, has indicated he would skip all four of the early primary and caucus states in a presidential campaign, focusing instead on the Super Tuesday primaries in March, and he may not even take the step of putting his name on the ballot in New Hampshire.\n"

        "title": "Bloomberg's Team Calls His Crude Remarks on Women 'Wrong'",
        "text": "It was a cheeky birthday gift for a hard-charging boss, a 32-page book of one-liners compiled by colleagues at his company. \"The Portable Bloomberg: The Wit and Wisdom of Michael Bloomberg,\" presented in 1990 to the future mayor of New York City, even featured drawings of its namesake in gladiatorial garb.\n\nOne remark attributed to Mr. Bloomberg went like this: \"If women wanted to be appreciated for their brains, they'd go to the library instead of to Bloomingdale's.\" Another line, purportedly Mr. Bloomberg's sales pitch for his eponymous computer terminal, said the machine will \"do everything,\" including oral sex, although a cruder term was used.\n\n\"I guess,\" Mr. Bloomberg was quoted as saying, \"that puts a lot of you girls out of business.\"\n\nWhen the pamphlet resurfaced during Mr. Bloomberg's 2001 mayoral run, he dismissed the comments as \"borscht belt jokes\" and said he did not recall saying them. The story line receded after the 9/11 terror attacks, and Mr. Bloomberg went on to win election three times over.\n\nBut the comments revealed a cruder side of Mr. Bloomberg, now 77 and a potential presidential candidate, who made his billions in the towel-snapping culture of Wall Street decades before #MeToo became a household term.\n\nLawsuits portrayed the early days of his company as a frat house, with employees bragging about sexual exploits. Even after entering politics, Mr. Bloomberg's cavalier attitude caused trouble: In 2012, the mayor, while admiring a woman at a party, urged two guests to \"look at the ass on her.\" Just last year, he cast doubt on harassment allegations against Charlie Rose, the disgraced CBS anchor. \"I don't know how true all of it is,\" Mr. Bloomberg told The New York Times.\n\nOn Wednesday, after inquiries from The Times, Mr. Bloomberg's team issued a statement addressing his history of insensitive comments.\n\n\"Mike has come to see that some of what he has said is disrespectful and wrong,\" said a spokesman, Stu Loeser, who served as Mr. Bloomberg's City Hall press secretary and is now advising his prospective presidential bid. \"He believes his words have not always aligned with his values and the way he has led his life.\"\n\nMr. Bloomberg is loath to admit fault, and the statement stops short of an apology. But it signals a recognition among aides that his behavior \u2014 little-known outside New York City circles \u2014 will face heavy scrutiny should he enter the 2020 presidential race, at a time when questions of gender and workplace conduct have taken center stage.\n\nA majority of Democratic primary voters are women. The party is trying to unseat a president who has faced multiple allegations of sexual assault, in a year where a record number of female candidates are competing in the Democratic field. And cultural norms have shifted in the aftermath of the revelations that fueled the #MeToo movement: former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., for instance, was forced to explain his penchant for hugging strangers after several women described feeling uncomfortable with his physical interactions.\n\nRepublican lawmakers have said little about President Trump's alleged assaults, but the left has set a different standard, as former Senator Al Franken discovered when he resigned last year.\n\n\"If you have a problem with women, you are not going to be the Democratic nominee,\" said Mary Anne Marsh, a Democratic political strategist who is unaffiliated with any candidate.\n\nMr. Bloomberg's defenders say that his advocacy for women and women's issues are one of his biggest strengths.\n\nHe elevated women to leading roles at City Hall, including Janette Sadik-Khan to transportation commissioner; Amanda Burden to city planning commissioner; and his longtime top adviser, Patricia E. Harris, to first deputy mayor, the first woman to serve in that role. As New York's mayor and in the years since \u2014 he left office in 2013 \u2014 Mr. Bloomberg has donated tens of millions of dollars to support reproductive rights and women's health causes around the world, his aides said.\n\n\"To say he's one of the biggest champions for women in this country and all over the world would be an understatement,\" said Jill Lafer, a former national chairwoman of Planned Parenthood, who recalled Mr. Bloomberg making an unsolicited donation of $250,000 to the organization in 2012 after a major donor pulled funding.\n\nIn interviews, several former New York City officials said that they had not heard Mr. Bloomberg, who sat alongside his deputies in an open-plan office, make sexist or offensive comments during their time working together. \"No one was made to feel any kind of negativity on the basis of any kind of gender or gender orientation,\" said Ester Fuchs, a professor at Columbia who was a senior policy adviser to Mr. Bloomberg during his first term as mayor.\n\nStill, Mr. Bloomberg's boorish reputation in the 1980s and 1990s was a potential stumbling block even in 2001, when he first took a run at political office. Biographies of Mr. Bloomberg, along with contemporary news reports, have described the company in those days as a hotbed of brusque talk that was often demeaning to women.\n\nOne lawsuit, filed in 1997, accused Mr. Bloomberg of reacting poorly upon learning that an employee was pregnant. The employee alleged that Mr. Bloomberg told her, \"kill it,\" referring to her baby, before grumbling about the number of pregnant women at his company. Mr. Bloomberg denied making the remark; the case was settled with no admission of guilt. In 2001, Mr. Bloomberg's staff said he passed a polygraph test concerning the comment, though the results were not released.\n\nA class-action lawsuit filed in 2007, alleging a pattern of discrimination at the company against pregnant employees and new mothers, was dismissed by a federal judge in 2011 for lack of evidence.\n\nMr. Bloomberg \u2014 who once described his dating life as a divorced billionaire as \"a wet dream\" \u2014 was married for 18 years to Susan Brown, with whom he has two daughters. He has dated his current companion, Diana L. Taylor, since 2000.\n\nSome friends and colleagues of Mr. Bloomberg say his crude language developed during his upbringing in the 1950s, his college fraternity years at Johns Hopkins and the 1970s machismo of the investment banking industry, which was dominated by men.\n\nGenerational differences, however, can be politically perilous in 2019, when the Democratic left is attuned to candidates' language about gender relations and issues involving harassment and assault.\n\nIn a 1998 deposition, Mr. Bloomberg was asked about his threshold for believing a rape allegation; \"I guess an unimpeachable third-party witness,\" he replied. The case for which he was deposed, involving a saleswoman who said that she had been harassed and raped by her manager at Bloomberg L.P., was closed in 2001 after the saleswoman's lawyer missed a court-imposed deadline.\n\nMr. Loeser, the Bloomberg spokesman, said on Wednesday that the \"third-party\" comment came in the midst of a hostile deposition. \"That's not what he believes,\" Mr. Loeser said.\n\nMr. Bloomberg's supportive remarks last year about Mr. Rose suggested another potential trouble spot. Mr. Rose, who was close with the mayor, taped his PBS talk show at Bloomberg L.P.'s Manhattan office tower, and he dated Ms. Burden, one of Mr. Bloomberg's highest-ranking city commissioners. In late 2017, Mr. Rose was fired by CBS after being accused of touching various women inappropriately, making sexually provocative remarks and walking around naked in front of some of them.\n\nAsked by The Times last year about the #MeToo movement, Mr. Bloomberg brought up Mr. Rose unprompted. \"You know, is it true?\" Mr. Bloomberg said of the allegations. \"You look at people that say it is, but we have a system where you have \u2014 presumption of innocence is the basis of it.\" He said that only a court could determine the veracity of such misconduct claims.\n\nMr. Bloomberg's aides point to his remarks at a 2018 event for Emily's List, which supports female political candidates who are in favor of abortion rights. \"Thanks to so many women who have courageously spoken out, the #MeToo movement has shone a spotlight on sexual assault, abuse and harassment that, disgracefully, society has tolerated for a very long time,\" Mr. Bloomberg said at the time.\n\nHis team also noted Mr. Bloomberg's efforts as mayor of New York to promote abortion rights policies, like requiring city hospitals to instruct resident doctors on abortion care. Bloomberg L.P. now offers 26 weeks of paid parental leave to a primary caregiver, along with benefits for gender-transition surgery.\n\nStill, Ms. Marsh, the Democratic strategist, said that as a candidate, Mr. Bloomberg would need to prepare for a more stringent spotlight than he may be used to.\n\n\"He has to wrestle with the fact that voters are not looking at him as the mayor of New York, they're not looking at him as the philanthropist who has done many good deeds,\" she said in an interview. \"He's now going to be measured in a way he's never been measured before: Can you be president after Donald Trump? And that comes with a whole different sort of tests.\"\n\nMaggie Haberman contributed reporting. Susan C. Beachy contributed research.\n"

        "title": "Watergate redux? Trump impeachment inquiry heads for live TV",
        "text": "Back in 1973, tens of millions of Americans tuned in to what Variety called \"the hottest daytime soap opera\" ?the Senate Watergate hearings that eventually led to resignation.\n\nIt was a communal experience, and by some estimates, more than 80% of Americans tuned in to at least part of the Watergate telecasts. They were offered by ABC, CBS and NBC, as well as PBS, which won acclaim and viewers by showing not only the live hearings but also the full-length replays in prime time.\n\nSeeing the witnesses lay out the case against the president moved public opinion decidedly in favor of impeachment.\n\nBut this time may be different.\n\nWhen the of President Donald Trump begins its public phase on Wednesday, people will be watching on screens large and small. Many, in fact, are likely to be watching the proceedings on more than one screen, with real-time reinforcement of their preexisting views of Trump on social media platforms and other venues that did not exist in Nixon's time.\n\nIn the Watergate era, there was no Fox News or nationally prominent conservative talk radio shows, which today are favored by many of Trump's supporters. Nor was there the equivalent of MSNBC, which caters to left-of-center partisans.\n\n\"People now have a far greater variety of options as to consume this,\" said professor Tobe Berkovitz, a former political media consultant who teaches communications at Boston University.\n\n\"Everyone might watch the same hearing, but then people are going to divide into camps in terms of how they want to engage with the analysis,\" he said. \"You're going to pick who you want to interpret and propagandize.\"\n\nTwo decades before Watergate, Americans had their first collective immersion in live telecasts of a high-stakes Washington hearing when Sen. Joseph McCarthy, R-Wis., polarized the country with his relentless pursuit of suspected communist sympathizers. Joseph Welch, a lawyer representing the Army, is remembered to this day for his question to McCarthy in 1954: \"Have you no sense of decency, sir?\"\n\nThe Watergate hearings produced a comparably memorable catchphrase, when Sen. Howard Baker, R-Tenn., summarized the gist of the complex inquiry into a politically motivated break-in: \"What did the president know and when did he know it?\" A damning answer eventually surfaced after the Select Committee on Presidential Campaign Activities, as the Senate's Watergate Committee was officially called, obtained secret Oval Office tapes that implicated Nixon in a cover-up.\n\nIn the runup to President Bill Clinton's impeachment by the House in December 1998 and acquittal by the Senate two months later, there was a similar dramatic twist when disclosure of Monica Lewinsky's semen-stained blue dress undercut Clinton's claim that he had never had sex with her.\n\nKathleen Hall Jamieson, director of the University of Pennsylvania's Annenberg Public Policy Center, said Americans expecting an equally dramatic moment in the upcoming impeachment telecasts may be let down, given that so much important testimony already has been presented in closed-door sessions.\n\n\"If you're expecting revelation as opposed to confirmation, you're going to be disappointed,\" Jamieson said. \"It's going to seem anticlimactic unless something new is discovered.\"\n\nShe noted another contrast between Watergate and the Trump inquiry. Nixon and his top aides struggled to communicate persuasively with the public as the investigation unfolded, whereas Trump and his advisers are making intensive use of advertising and social media \"to make sure his base stays locked down.\"\n\nWill the upcoming impeachment telecasts change many minds?\n\nMark Meckler, an early leader in the tea party movement, predicts a lot of Americans won't even watch the broadcasts because they've already reached conclusions.\n\nMany Trump supporters won't tune in \"because they think it's a sham process,\" he said. \"And I don't think most people on the left will watch because they already know the conclusion in their minds. To them, the president has been impeachable since before he was elected.\"\n\nBut Darrell West, a longtime political science professor who is now vice president of the Brookings Institution, said the telecasts will boost public interest.\n\n\"They will put human faces on the closed-door testimony,\" he said in an email. \"Viewers will be able to observe what people say and how they say it as well as the manner in which they answer questions.\"\n\nWest acknowledged that most people have made up their minds on Trump's guilt or innocence.\n\n\"But the testimony doesn't have to shift very many people to be politically influential,\" he wrote. \"If only 10% are affected negatively by the testimony, Trump's removal number jumps from 50 to 60%. That would represent an enormous hit for him and could lead some Republican Senators to consider a vote to remove the President.\"\n\nArthur Sanders, a professor of politics at Drake University in Des Moines, Iowa, recalled that public support for Nixon's impeachment grew as the televised Watergate inquiry progressed, while most Americans remained opposed to Clinton's ouster at every stage of his impeachment process.\n\n\"The Democrats hope this follows the Nixon model ?Trump has always hoped it follows the Clinton model,\" Sanders said.\n\nRegardless of how the TV audience shapes up, Sanders knows of some Americans eager to follow the Trump impeachment drama.\n\n\"What's going on now is horrible for the country, but it's the best time to teach classes on American politics,\" he said. \"The students are so curious, trying to figure out what's going on ?what's normal in American politics and what isn't.\"\n\nAs for PBS, it's not planning a repeat of prime-time impeachment replays but says the daytime telecasts will be available on demand via all of PBS' digital platforms.\n"

        "text": "At the very least, Gordon Sondland's diplomatic inexperience and tendency to go rogue threatened to muddle U.S. policy toward Ukraine. A number of people who have testified in the impeachment inquiry have said or hinted as much about the ambassador to the European Union.\n\nAnother possibility is that Sondland was acting at the direction of President Trump to pressure Ukrainians to investigate his political rivals.\n\nEither way, he is one of the few witnesses in the impeachment inquiry who is in a position to confirm what Trump wanted out of Ukraine in exchange for holding up its military aid. He's testifying publicly Wednesday.\n\nHere are the five questions we have for Sondland.\n\n1. Were you acting of your own volition, or at the direction of Trump?\nThis is the crux of the impeachment inquiry right now: Did Trump orchestrate all of this? We don't know.\n\nWe know Sondland offered Ukrainians a quid pro quo. We know Trump told his acting chief of staff to hold up military aid days before he called Ukraine's president and asked for investigations into the Biden family. But we don't know for sure that Trump tied those things together himself \u2014 military aid in exchange for investigations into his political opponents.\n\nSondland is one of the few people we're hearing from in this inquiry who appeared to have a direct line to Trump and the Ukrainians.\n\nFormer White House official Tim Morrison testified Tuesday that Sondland talked to Trump about half a dozen times this summer as the White House froze aid to Ukraine. In fact, Sondland told Morrison he briefed Trump right before Trump called Ukraine's new president in July. In that call, Trump ignored national security talking points issued by Morrison's team in favor of asking Zelensky to investigate former vice president Joe Biden. At one point, Morrison said Sondland became known as the \"Gordon problem\" in the National Security Council.\n\nSondland has not implicated Trump in this. He testified that he \"presumed\" the frozen aid was linked to investigations Trump wanted, and so he told the Ukrainians as much. Was he just acting of his own volition? Was someone else telling him what to do?\n\nSondland's testimony to Congress doesn't give us any hints he plans to implicate the president: \"I always believed that suspending aid to Ukraine was ill-advised, although I did not know (and still do not know) when, why, or by whom the aid was suspended.\"\n\nWho is Gordon Sondland and why does his public testimony matter?\n\n2. What did you say to Trump \u2014 and Trump to you \u2014 on a July phone call from Kyiv?\n\nDiplomat David Holmes testified Saturday that Sondland was in Ukraine the day after Trump talked to Ukraine's president on the phone. Sondland called Trump from a restaurant. During that call, Holmes testified, he overheard Trump ask about \"the investigations.\"\n\nSo many questions here. Trump has said he didn't remember that phone call. But does Sondland? The rest of that conversation could go a long way to helping uncover whether Trump was ordering Sondland directly.\n\nThat phone call and other moments gave the impression to other diplomats and White House officials working on Ukraine that Sondland had a direct line to the president in a way few, if any, others did.\n\nSign up for The 5-Minute Fix newsletter, focused on explaining the impeachment inquiry every weekday afternoon.\n\n3. You told the Ukrainians their military aid would come when their president made an \"anti-corruption statement.\" Was that code for investigations into the Bidens/the 2016 election interference?\nIn his amended testimony, Sondland confirmed to Congress he effectively gave the Ukrainians a quid pro quo, though he doesn't use those words. In fact, he seems to be glossing over what he wanted the Ukrainians to do: \"I presumed that the aid suspension had become linked to the proposed anti-corruption statement,\" he said in his clarified statement to Congress.\n\nBut the \"anti-corruption statement\" they were working on mentioned the Ukrainian energy company Burisma. Sondland's colleague, former special envoy to Ukraine Kurt Volker, testified Tuesday that in hindsight he realized Burisma was code for the Biden family because former vice president Biden's son served on the company's board. And Volker said he thought that was inappropriate.\n\nSondland needs to explain why he thought that having Ukraine investigate Democrats was the right thing to do.\n\n4. Why didn't you remember the offer you gave to the Ukrainians in your original testimony?\nSondland first testified behind closed doors in October with a lot of \"I don't recall\" statements. It wasn't until Taylor testified that he understood Sondland gave Ukraine a quid pro quo, and then National Security Council official Tim Morrison confirming Taylor's testimony, that Sondland suddenly remembered what he did.\n\nWas Sondland trying to protect himself with his original testimony by effectively denying a quid pro quo? Or Trump? Or both?\n\nThe gaps in Sondland's memory perplex Jack Sharman, a lawyer who worked on the impeachment of Alabama Gov. Robert Bentley and was a counsel for the House during the Whitewater investigations in the 1990s. Wouldn't Sondland have tried to nail down every detail before going under oath to testify in the impeachment inquiry of a president? \"It seems he was a little relaxed given the scrutiny each person was going to get,\" Sharman said. \"It seems unusually loose to me.\"\n\n5. Why did you agree to testify?\nOthers in Trump's orbit have ignored subpoenas, like acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney. Even former national security adviser John Bolton, who seems to want to testify, isn't going to Congress until a court tells him he has to. So I'm genuinely curious why Sondland agreed (after a subpoena, of course). He is someone who has tied his career to Trump even though he said he didn't initially agree with him during the campaign.\n\nNow he's in a difficult position, seemingly wanting to protect himself and the president, but one of the few witnesses who can confirm what Trump knew and when.\n"

Our community is raising up against this racist and cold corporation. The fact that Comcast has yielded ten minutes of their time in front of the Supreme Court to Donald Trump's Department of Justice adds insult to injury. \n\nThere is a rising tide of activism in this country that is targeting corporations that value dollars more than our lives.

        "text": "Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) unveiled sweeping legislation Thursday to invest up to $172 billion over the next decade to drastically upgrade the nation's 1.2 million public housing units as part of a Green New Deal.\n\nThe bill, set to be introduced Thursday afternoon, calls for retrofitting the federally owned homes, improving energy efficiency, converting oil-burning furnaces and gas-fired stoves to renewable-energy electric alternatives, and replacing the lead-leaching pipes causing public health crises in cities across the country.\n\nThe so-called Green New Deal for Public Housing Act marks one of the boldest efforts yet to legislate the Green New Deal movement that, since its debut in mainstream politics with a series of protests a year ago, has reframed the global climate policy debate, providing a popular alternative to the market-friendly dogma that's dominated Western politics for decades.\n\n\"Faced with the global crisis of climate change, the United States must lead the world in transforming our energy system away from fossil fuel to sustainable energy,\" Sanders, a top-tier candidate for the Democratic presidential nomination, said in a statement. \"This bill shows that we can address our climate and affordable housing crises by making public housing a model of efficiency, sustainability and resiliency.\"\n\nThe bill is unlikely to become law because it would face fierce opposition from mainstream Democrats and virtually all Republicans, whose party's ideological project of the past half-century has focused on dismantling the public sector the New Deal expanded rapidly after the Great Depression. Just one other lawmaker, Sen. Jeff Merkley (D-Ore.), co-sponsored the Senate version of the bill.\n\nBut the legislation provides a tangible marker of what a Green New Deal would actually look like, and it offers a glimpse of how Sanders would govern if he were to defeat President Donald Trump next November.\n\nIn much the same way that Sanders's steady drumbeat for \"Medicare for All\" energized the U.S. movement for the kind of single-payer health care system that exists in much of the developed world, the public housing proposal could build a political constituency to revitalize a crucial source of affordable homes for the American working class. The effort comes as public housing units are a shambles, real estate prices are rising faster than wages in 80% of U.S. housing markets and homelessness has climbed for the past two years.\n\nThe legislation also shows for the first time how national policy to slash climate-changing emissions can reduce poverty and racial inequity by targeting long-term investments at largely minority communities, cleaning up sickness-causing pollution and creating demand for jobs that would go to local communities.\n\nOcasio-Cortez endorsed Sanders's bid for the presidency last month and held a rally in front of the Queensbridge Houses in the Long Island City neighborhood of Queens. The nation's largest public housing development \u2015 already suffering from mold and rat and roach infestations after decades of disinvestment and neglect \u2015 neighbors New York City's dirtiest power plant.\n\nThe benefits to the United States' most populous city would be considerable. Eliminating climate pollution from New York City Housing Authority (NYCHA) units would require $48 billion in investments by 2030 but would reduce utility costs by $200 million to $398 million per year and slash asthma rates by up to 30%, according to independent calculations by the left-leaning think tank Data for Progress.\n\nThe employment gains, however, would go overwhelmingly to states that voted for Trump.\n\nThe bill's mandate to revamp the existing public housing structures would spur $119 billion to $172 billion in spending over a decade, Data for Progress found.\n\n\"Who knows what Americans will contribute by really taking public housing seriously, by investing in it seriously, and by making it green and healthy and safe.\"\n\n- Daniel Aldana Cohen, University of Pennsylvania's Socio-Spatial Climate Collaborative\nThe legislation would help create nearly 241,000 good-paying jobs per year with provisions requiring union labor and U.S.-made materials for renovation projects. It would also create 22,300 to 36,000 career-track jobs in maintenance and construction, with average yearly incomes ranging from close to $70,000 in California to $61,600 in Georgia.\n\nOf those jobs, states that went to the Republican presidential candidate in 2016 would receive on average 17,489 jobs compared with 9,428 in blue states, the Data for Progress study showed. Yet, on the congressional level, districts that voted for Democrats in the 2018 election would see a slightly higher influx of jobs, with 14,224 compared with 12,168 in red districts.\n\n\"You're really mobilizing the public sector to deliver benefits to all Americans,\" said Daniel Aldana Cohen, director of the University of Pennsylvania's Socio-Spatial Climate Collaborative and the author of Data for Progress's report.\n\nPublic housing policy has encouraged market shifts that benefited the many before. In the early 1990s, the state-controlled utility New York Power Authority set about reducing the electricity that refrigerators in NYCHA units used. In 1995, following a competition between three top appliance makers, officials awarded a contract to Maytag to manufacture a small, super-efficient refrigerator. The final product used less than half the power of the older refrigerators, going from 1,110 kilowatt hours per year in 1991 to 437 kilowatt hours by 1997, according to a study by the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy.\n\nAnd making a large-scale investment in public housing would make the United States competitive with other nations again, Aldana Cohen said.\n\nIn May, the European Union awarded a prestigious architectural prize to an upgraded public housing complex in Bordeaux, France. Last month, the Royal Institute of British Architects' Stirling Prize went to a 105-home public housing development in the British city of Norwich.\n\nBuildings accounted for about 12% of planet-heating emissions in the United States, federal figures show, but the number could be as high as 39% according to the U.S. Green Building Council. The sector worldwide amounts to 39% of energy-related carbon dioxide released into the atmosphere, the United Nations estimates.\n\n\"In Europe, green public housing is one of the most exciting technological sectors of the building industry,\" said Aldana Cohen. \"Who knows what Americans will contribute by really taking public housing seriously, by investing in it seriously, and by making it green and healthy and safe.\"\n"

        "text": "The permanent funding source that officials at the Greenwood Lake Commission have been seeking for two decades to maintain and improve the lake's New Jersey end could be on its way.\n\nAfter gaining approval from the state Assembly Appropriations Committee on Thursday, a bill that would set aside $500,000 a year for programs to clean up the southern portion of Greenwood Lake is expected to go up for a decisive vote in the full chamber later this year.\n\n\"Greenwood Lake is a great natural, economic, and recreational resource,\" said Assemblyman Jay Webber, R-Morris, a bill sponsor. \"This will put resources directly toward environmental enhancement of the waterway, including water quality improvement and weed harvesting.\"\n\nThe bill, A-3804, was approved by state senators in a 40-0 vote in 2018. An Assembly vote is expected before the end of 2019 and needed before the governor can sign the bill into law. \n\nIf approved, the legislation would divert funding from existing boat registration and renewal fees to the 20-year-old, bi-state commission. The group's co-chairman, Paul Zarrillo, said he is optimistic the bill will pass by a wide margin.\n\n\"It's been a long year-and-a-half struggle, and it's taken since February to have it come up in the appropriations Committee,\" he said. \"That was our biggest hurdle, I think.\"\n\nZarrillo once pushed for lake user fees on recreational boaters in an ill-fated attempt to gain funding for stump removal, water monitoring, phosphorous reduction and other improvement projects.\n\nHe said dedicating funds from statewide fees is a better option, as it requires no new levies or administrative costs. It will also generate about five times more revenue, he said. \n\nA boater waves as he passes on Greenwood Lake on Wednesday, August 8, 2018. \n\"This is significantly better,\" Zarrillo said. \"A lot of people had problems with the user fee, especially the marina owners, who would have had to manage it.\"\n\nThe funding comes at a critical time for Greenwood Lake, which suffered through an algal bloom this summer and fall. Confirmed in mid-July, the bloom triggered beach closures and no-swimming advisories during peak season for recreational boaters, water sports enthusiasts and local businesses.\n\nNew Jersey records show the bloom stretched lakewide. However, there were no advisories in New York State, where different regulations are used to identify and confirm potentially toxic blooms. The discrepancy has triggered skepticism among residents and elected officials in New Jersey about how the Garden State handled the problem.\n\n\"While the algae bloom had a devastating effect on the local economy, the approval of this legislation is the heartening step,\" said state Sen. Joseph Pennacchio, R-Morris. \"The state of New Jersey must prioritize funding to safeguard one of Passaic County's most popular and scenic waterways, rather than let the expense fall on the backs of the local residents and business owners.\"\n\nThe 7-mile-long lake is split between New York and New Jersey but drains into New Jersey's Monksville and Wanaque reservoirs. The reservoir system controlled by the North Jersey Water District Supply Commission can serve more than 3 million people at peak capacity, commission records show.\n\nAccording to the bill, the funding could be used for activities on the New Jersey side of the lake only when there are no matching funds from New York for a lakewide project.\n\nIn January 2018, state officials approved a $500,000 annually renewing funding for Lake Hopatcong. That lake, in Morris and Sussex counties, is the only home-lined lake in New Jersey larger than Greenwood Lake.\n"

A GOP source told Fox News this week that it's unlikely Democrats would go along with the efforts to call Schiff -- who is essentially leading the impeachment probe.\n\nThe source told Fox News that Republicans want answers to questions like: \u8940ow many times did he [Schiff] meet with the whistleblower? What did they advise the whistleblower to do? How much was Schiff involved in this? Did he recommend the whistleblower give the complaint to the intelligence community inspector general, even though there was no intel component so that he could be involved??\nBut GOP lawmakers for days had telegraphed that they were interested in making the attempt.\n\nRep.

The rules of impeachment are very clear we'll have to have a trial,\" said McConnell, who was similarly critical of the motion to dismiss Clinton's 1999 impeachment trial.\n\n\"My own view is that we should give people an opportunity to put the case on.

Kent also described his awareness of a \"campaign to smear\" former U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch, whom Trump then recalled.\n\nDemocrats hope the public hearing will build public support for impeachment by laying out detailed testimony before a national television audience about what steps Trump took to damage Biden, a front-runner in the Democratic presidential primary.\n\n\"It's possible that we can go through this entire public hearing process and nothing will move.

        "text": "The former national security adviser would be an important witness in the impeachment inquiry, but his lawyer wants a court to rule on whether he should testify.\n\nATLANTA \u2014 John R. Bolton, President Trump's former national security adviser, knows about \"many relevant meetings and conversations\" connected to the Ukraine pressure campaign that House impeachment investigators have not yet been informed about, his lawyer told lawmakers on Friday.\n\nThe lawyer, Charles J. Cooper, made that tantalizing point in a letter to the chief House lawyer in response to House committee chairmen who have sought Mr. Bolton's testimony in their impeachment proceedings, arguing that his client would be willing to talk but only if a court rules that he should ignore White House objections.\n\nMr. Cooper did not elaborate on what meetings and conversations he was referring to, leaving it to House Democrats to guess at what Mr. Bolton might know. Mr. Bolton has been one of the most anticipated witnesses because other current and former officials have described him as deeply disturbed by the effort to pressure Ukraine to provide incriminating information about Democrats to help the president's domestic political prospects.\n\nMr. Bolton did not show up for a deposition scheduled on Thursday because, his lawyer said, he wants a judge to determine whether he and his former deputy, Charles M. Kupperman, should testify in defiance of the White House. In effect, Mr. Bolton and Mr. Kupperman are asking for a court ruling on competing demands by the executive branch, which does not want them to testify, and the legislative branch, which does.\n\nHouse Democrats complained that Mr. Bolton was stiff-arming them even though other national security officials have complied with subpoenas or requests for testimony, but the lawmakers have withdrawn a subpoena for Mr. Kupperman and indicated they would not seek one for Mr. Bolton because they said they did not want to get dragged into lengthy court proceedings. Instead, Democrats have suggested that they may cite the refusal to testify by Mr. Bolton and Mr. Kupperman as evidence of obstruction of Congress by the president, which could form its own article of impeachment.\n\nIn representing Mr. Bolton and Mr. Kupperman, Mr. Cooper denied that they were trying to delay proceedings and insisted that their legal position was not coordinated with the White House. Mr. Cooper argued that if the House was serious about an inquiry, then Mr. Bolton would be a logical person to question.\n\nMr. Bolton \"was personally involved in many of the events, meetings, and conversations about which you have already received testimony, as well as many relevant meetings and conversations that have not yet been discussed in the testimonies thus far,\" Mr. Cooper wrote in the letter.\n\nMany witnesses who have testified so far have placed Mr. Bolton at the center of key events, describing him as exasperated by the efforts by people around the president \u2014 led by his personal lawyer Rudolph W. Giuliani \u2014 to pressure Ukraine to investigate Democrats. Mr. Bolton said he wanted nothing to do with the \"drug deal,\" as he put it, that other presidential advisers were orchestrating and called Mr. Giuliani a \"hand grenade who's going to blow everybody up,\" according to testimony by Fiona Hill, the president's former top Russia and Europe adviser.\n\nMr. Bolton directed Ms. Hill to report to a White House lawyer her conversation with Gordon D. Sondland, the ambassador to the European Union who was involved in the pressure campaign. And he objected to Mr. Trump's decision to suspend $391 million in security aid to Ukraine and the decision to call President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine on July 25.\n\nDuring that call, Mr. Trump asked Mr. Zelensky to \"do us a favor\" and investigate Ukrainian connections to Democrats in 2016 and former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. and his son Hunter Biden, even though other administration officials had concluded there was no basis for such investigations.\n\nUnlike most of those who have testified so far, though, Mr. Bolton would bring knowledge of what the president himself said about the matter. Most of the witnesses have described what people around the president said, but few recounted any direct conversations with Mr. Trump. As his national security adviser who saw him daily, Mr. Bolton presumably could take investigators into the Oval Office as none of their witnesses have.\n\nMr. Trump seemed to reference that himself on Friday during comments to reporters before flying to Atlanta for campaign events.\n\n\"I'm not concerned about anything,\" he said, shrugging off the impeachment inquiry. \"The testimony has all been fine. For the most part, I never even heard of these people. I have no idea who they are. They are some very fine people. You have some never Trumpers. It seems that nobody has any firsthand knowledge. There is no firsthand knowledge.\"\n\nHouse Democrats have argued that ongoing court proceedings to compel Donald F. McGahn II, the president's former White House counsel, to testify on other matters should guide Mr. Bolton and Mr. Kupperman. But Mr. Cooper said any final judgment on Mr. McGahn would still not answer the question about whether his clients should testify because they would be asked about national security matters in a way that Mr. McGahn would not be.\n\nMr. Cooper cited the House Judiciary Committee's own brief in the McGahn case, which made the point that the panel's interest in the former White House counsel \"did not involve the sensitive topics of national security or foreign affairs.\"\n\n\"Here, unlike McGahn, information concerning national security and foreign affairs is at the heart of the committees' impeachment inquiry, and it is difficult to imagine any question that the committees might put to\" Mr. Kupperman or Mr. Bolton \"that would not implicate these sensitive areas,\" Mr. Cooper wrote.\n\nMoreover, he wrote, the aides who have agreed to testify in the impeachment inquiry so far did not face the same constraints that Mr. Bolton and Mr. Kupperman because \"they did not provide direct advice to the president on a regular or frequent basis.\"\n\nOnly a court can decide in their case, Mr. Cooper added. \"If the House chooses not to pursue through subpoena the testimony of Dr. Kupperman and Ambassador Bolton,\" he wrote, \"let the record be clear: That is the House's decision.\""

        "title": "Trump ordered quid pro quo freeze on U.S. aid to Ukraine despite legal concerns from Pentagon, State Department: military official",
        "text": "President Donald Trump ordered his staff to freeze nearly $400 million in aid to Ukraine a few days before a phone call in which he pressured the Eastern European nation's leader to investigate the family of political rival Joe Biden, a revelation that comes as more Democrats move toward impeachment proceedings.\n\nTrump, in remarks to reporters at the United Nations on Tuesday, confirmed that he held up the aid but said he did so to fight corruption and urge European nations to share in helping out Ukraine.\n\n\"As far as withholding funds, those funds were paid,\" Trump said. \"They were fully paid. But my complaint has always been, and I'd withhold again and I'll continue to withhold until such time as Europe and other nations contribute to Ukraine.\" He named Germany and France as among the countries that should \"put up money.\"\n\nHe also used the moment to again suggest that the Biden family inappropriately benefited from their ties to Ukraine.\n\nTrump's order was first reported by The Washington Post and was confirmed to The Associated Press by two people familiar with but not authorized to discuss private conversations. They spoke on the condition of anonymity.\n\nLate Monday, an influential group of freshmen Democrats who served in the military and national security before winning office said Trump's actions cut to the core of the country's defenses. Their views, as centrist lawmakers from previously Republican-held districts where Trump has been popular, hold sway with party leadership.\n\nAt issue is a summer phone call with Ukrainian President Voldymyr Zelenskiy, in which Trump is said to have pushed for investigations into Biden. In the days before that call, Trump ordered the aid to Ukraine frozen.\n\nTrump has insisted he did nothing wrong and has denied that any requests for help in procuring damaging information about Biden were tied to the aid freeze.\n\nThe United States began providing military aid to the government of Ukraine shortly after Russia illegally annexed Ukraine's Crimean peninsula in 2014. With Ukraine's new president still grappling with separatist rebels in the east, the aid has long been viewed as a measure of Washington's determination to push back against Russian President Vladimir Putin.\n\nDemocrats, and some Republicans, have urged the White House to be open about Trump's actions, which are at the center of a whistleblower complaint. But with no new information from the administration forthcoming, more than a dozen Democrats, including some in House leadership, added their names to those calling for impeachment proceedings.\n\nThe sudden rush of activity shows the extent to which Trump's call to the foreign leader, and his subsequent comments about the conversation, are raising further questions about whether the president improperly used his office to pressure another country as a way of helping his own reelection prospects.\n\n\"These allegations are stunning, both in the national security threat they pose and the potential corruption they represent,\" wrote the seven freshmen, who include a former Navy pilot, soldiers, officers and intelligence analysts.\n\n\"We do not arrive at this conclusion lightly,\" the lawmakers wrote in a Washington Post op-ed. The lawmakers include Reps. Gil Cisneros of California, Jason Crow of Colorado, Chrissy Houlahan of Pennsylvania, Elaine Luria of Virginia, Mikie Sherrill of New Jersey, Elissa Slotkin of Michigan and Abigail Spanberger of Virginia.\n\n\"These new allegations are a threat to all we have sworn to protect. We must preserve the checks and balances envisioned by the Founders and restore the trust of the American people in our government. And that is what we intend to do.\"\n\nCongress on Monday pressed for full disclosure of a whistleblower's complaint about Trump and pushed the White House to release a transcript of Trump's call with the Ukraine president.\n\nThe president has acknowledged the phone call. On Monday, he said he didn't want to give money to Ukraine \u2014 if there were corruption issues.\n\n\"It's very important to talk about corruption,\" Trump told reporters as he opened meetings at the United Nations. \"If you don't talk about corruption, why would you give money to a country that you think is, is corrupt?\"\n\nLater Monday, Trump denied telling the Ukraine president that his country would only get U.S. aid if it investigated Biden's son. \"I didn't do it,\" he said.\n\nThe fresh calls for impeachment proceedings come as House Democrats are heading into a closed-door meeting Tuesday with Speaker Nancy Pelosi.\n\nPelosi and her leadership team on the various oversight committees are considering bringing forward a resolution that will put the House on the record on this matter, according to a Democratic leadership aide unauthorized to discuss the private talks. The aide was granted anonymity.\n\nStill, Democrats remained divided on moving forward with an effort to impeach Trump. Pelosi has resisted calls for impeachment and is sticking with her position that Congress must not start formal proceedings unless the American public demands it.\n\nHowever, Pelosi said Sunday that unless the administration provides more information to Congress by the scheduled Thursday hearing at the intelligence committee, its officials \"will be entering a grave new chapter of lawlessness which will take us into a whole new stage of investigation.\"\n\nTrump has sought, without evidence, to implicate Biden and his son Hunter in the kind of corruption that has long plagued Ukraine. Hunter Biden served on the board of a Ukrainian gas company at the same time his father was leading the Obama administration's diplomatic dealings with Kyiv. Though the timing raised concerns among anti-corruption advocates, there has been no evidence of wrongdoing by either the former vice president or his son.\n\nREAD MORE: Trump's claims about the Bidens, explained\n\nThe matter is under new scrutiny following the whistleblower's mid-August complaint, which followed Trump's July 25 call with Ukraine's president. The person who filed the complaint did not have firsthand knowledge of the call, according to a person familiar with the matter.\n\nLawmakers are demanding details of the complaint, but the acting director of national intelligence, Joseph Maguire, has refused to share that information, citing presidential privilege. He is set to testify Thursday before the House.\n\n\"Let's see the transcript,\" said Sen. Mitt Romney, R-Utah, about Trump's call with the Ukraine president.\n\nThe chairmen of the House intelligence, Foreign Affairs and Oversight and Government Reform committees are threatening to subpoena Secretary of State Mike Pompeo if he does not produce information about whether Trump and his lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, inappropriately tried to influence the Ukraine government for political gain.\n\nMeanwhile, Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer of New York called on Republican Majority Leader Mitch McConnell to investigate the whistleblower's complaint. In a letter to McConnell, he said that the Republicans' \"see no evil, hear no evil\" attitude toward the president's actions \"is unacceptable and must change.\"\n\nRepublican Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida doesn't think Trump's actions are grounds for impeachment, but said he wouldn't have called a foreign leader to discuss a rival.\n\n\"I don't think he should have raised the topic of Joe Biden with the Ukraine president,\" Rubio said.\n\nMcConnell said Monday the matter is best left behind closed doors in the classified setting of the intelligence committee, though he did push into the spotlight his own role in securing the Ukraine aid.\n\nMcConnell said he had been \"personally pressuring\" the Trump administration this summer in calls to Pompeo and Secretary of Defense Mark Esper to release the U.S. aid money.\n\nTrump said Monday he may, or may not, release details or a transcript of the call but has stressed that foreign leaders should feel free to speak frankly with an American president without fear that the details of their conversations will later be disclosed.\n\nHunter Biden was hired by the Ukrainian gas company Burisma Holdings in April 2014, two months after Ukraine's Russia-friendly former president was ousted by protesters and as Biden's father was heavily involved in U.S. efforts to support the new pro-Western government. The move immediately raised concerns that the Ukrainian firm, whose owner was a political ally of the ousted president, was seeking to gain influence with the Obama administration.\n\nAssociated Press writers Alan Fram, Matthew Daly, Michael Balsamo, Laurie Kellman and Zeke Miller in Washington contributed to this report."

        "title": "Trump impeachment hearings: 5 key takeaways from the first day",
        "text": "The first day of public impeachment hearings resulted in new evidence supporting the Democrats' case that President Trump was leveraging U.S. aid to Ukraine to get President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden. State Department officials Bill Taylor and George Kent, career diplomats who have served under multiple presidents, were the witnesses Wednesday before the House Intelligence Committee.\n\nHere are the key moments from today's testimony.\n\n\u2018Trump cares more about the investigations of Biden'\nWhile much of Taylor's testimony had already been disclosed in the transcripts of his earlier, closed-door deposition, there was key new information. Taylor, the top U.S. diplomat in Ukraine, described a conversation in which Trump pressed the U.S. ambassador to the European Union, Gordon Sondland, for information about \"the investigations.\"\n\nTaylor was not part of the call, which occurred on July 26, the day after the phone call between Trump and Zelensky that kicked off the investigation. He was told about it by an embassy staffer, who was meeting with Sondland at a restaurant when the ambassador placed a call to the White House. The staffer told Taylor that he was able to hear both ends of the conversation.\n\n\"Following the call with President Trump, the member of my staff asked Ambassador Sondland what President Trump thought about Ukraine,\" Taylor testified. \"Ambassador Sondland responded that President Trump cares more about the investigations of Biden, which [Rudy] Giuliani was pressing for.\" Taylor said he had informed the State Department and both the majority and minority counsels for the Intelligence Committee as soon as he found out about the July 26 call. Under questioning, he clarified that he believed Sondland was saying that Trump cared more about the investigation into the Bidens than he did about Ukraine.\n\nTrump, speaking at a press conference on Wednesday afternoon following a meeting with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, said it's the first he's heard of the July 26 call with Sondland and called Taylor's testimony \"secondhand information.\" When pressed, Trump said he didn't recall the conversation at all, \"not even a little bit.\"\n\nSondland, a businessman who was appointed to the ambassadorship following large donations to the Trump inauguration, will testify next week. He dramatically altered his testimony from last month's private deposition, saying he had \"refreshed [his] recollection\" and now remembered Trump tying foreign assistance to Ukraine to a public statement by Zelensky that Biden was under investigation.\n\nIn a September text message conversation with Sondland, Taylor said he thought it was \"crazy to withhold security assistance for help with a political campaign.\" Sondland said he had checked with Trump, who denied that was his intention. Taylor was asked about that during Wednesday's hearing.\n\n\"Have you ever seen another example of foreign aid conditioned on the personal or political interests of the president of the United States?\" asked Daniel Goldman, the staff lawyer asking questions for Democrats on the committee.\n\n\"No, Mr. Goldman, I've not,\" said Taylor.\n\nRep. Will Hurd, R-Texas, said the statement that Giuliani sought from Ukraine on Trump's behalf was meant to combat corruption in Kyiv. Kent said that wasn't an accurate assessment. \"That was not an anti-corruption statement,\" said Kent, noting that Giuliani pushed to include specific references to Biden's son Hunter's business interests in Ukraine and to the 2016 election.\n\nThe Republican case\n\nGOP members on the panel made a variety of arguments in the president's defense.\n\nRep. Michael Turner, R-Ohio, hammered the point that neither Taylor nor Kent had ever met Trump and were relying on second- and third-hand sources. The administration has refused to allow acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney to testify, and Giuliani has defied a subpoena, denying the inquiry of firsthand witnesses.\n\nRep. Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, who was added to the committee just last week in order to press the Republican case, argued that because Zelensky hadn't expressed concerns to Taylor about the aid in their three meetings over the summer, there must not have been a problem. Taylor pointed out that Zelensky wasn't aware the aid was being held up until the third meeting and that Ukrainian officials reached out after an August Politico article headlined \"Trump holds up Ukraine military aid meant to confront Russia.\"\n\nRep. John Ratcliffe, R-Texas, said that since Zelensky said publicly that Trump wasn't extorting and blackmailing him, that means he wasn't being extorted or blackmailed. Kent said his assessment was that Zelensky, who is dependent on American aid, could not afford to cross Trump in public.\n\nSeveral Republicans noted that after Russia invaded Ukraine and annexed part of it in 2014, Taylor urged his superiors to provide \"lethal aid\" to Ukraine, but the Obama administration sent only \"blankets,\" whereas Trump had supplied arms, including Javelin antitank missiles. The point went unchallenged in the hearing, although fact checkers note that, in fact, by 2015 the United States had given millions to Ukraine in drones, armored Humvees, counter-mortar radars and night-vision gear.\n\nKent absolves Biden\n\nKent, deputy assistant secretary at the State Department overseeing European and Eurasian affairs, said there was no truth to the allegations that Biden had acted inappropriately as vice president. Representing the Obama administration, Biden had pushed for the removal of a Ukrainian prosecutor accused of corruption, a position shared by the European Union and the International Monetary Fund. The prosecutor had previously investigated a Ukrainian energy company that had given a lucrative board seat to Biden's son. But the allegations against the company, Burisma Holdings, predated the younger Biden's appointment to the board, which was described as an effort to provide international oversight in the notoriously corrupt Ukrainian energy industry, and a Ukrainian prosecutor cleared the Bidens of any wrongdoing.\n\n\"Mr. Kent, are you familiar as you indicate in your opening statement that you're aware of these allegations related to Vice President Biden?\" asked Goldman.\n\n\"I am,\" said Kent.\n\n\"To your knowledge, is there any factual basis to support those allegations?\" asked Goldman.\n\n\"None whatsoever,\" said Kent.\n\n\"When Vice President Biden acted in Ukraine, did he act in accordance with official U.S. policy?\" asked Goldman, to which Kent replied, \"He did.\"\n\nRepublicans' lawyer rambles\n\nSteve Castor, the chief minority counsel for the House Oversight Committee, drew online criticism from both Democrats and Republicans for his meandering line of questioning. Castor confronted Taylor and Kent about why they weren't on Trump's call to Zelensky, only for both to explain that under normal diplomatic procedure they wouldn't be involved. Castor also sought to minimize what Taylor considered the impropriety of Trump setting up a backchannel diplomatic outreach to the Ukrainian government, enlisting Giuliani, Sondland (whose portfolio as ambassador to the European Union did not include Ukraine, which is not a member) and Energy Secretary Rick Perry. Taylor chuckled at Castor's attempt to say the process was \"irregular\" but not \"outlandish,\" but conceded it was \"not as outlandish as it could be.\"\n\nCastor did score a point in pressing Kent to admit that he had flagged concerns to the vice president's office about Hunter Biden's business activities in Ukraine, without results.\n\n\"Whatever the GOP counsel is doing, it's not working,\" wrote Ari Fleischer, who served as White House press secretary under George W. Bush. \"I don't [understand] where he's going.\"\n\n\"Lines up with what a few Republicans have said to me in the last few minutes,\" wrote Politico's Jake Sherman, retweeting Fleischer's comment.\n\nNunes turns the attack on Democrats and the media\n\nThe opening statement from ranking member Devin Nunes, R-Calif., was largely about how Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff has handled the inquiry. He said that \"Democrats conducted secret depositions\" in the basement of the Capitol, implying that Republicans were excluded from the preliminary testimony, although they were present and given time to ask questions. Nunes also insulted Taylor and Kent, saying, \"I'd like to congratulate you for qualifying for passing the Democrats' star chamber auditions\" and suggesting they were unwitting participants in a smear campaign against Trump.\n\nBefore witness testimony even began, Republicans pushed to interview the original whistleblower, whose report led to the announcement of a formal impeachment inquiry. Democrats have vowed to protect the whistleblower's anonymity, insisting his testimony wasn't necessary since his allegations have been corroborated by other witnesses.\n\n\"It won't be my single decision,\" Schiff said. \"We will entertain a motion to subpoena any witness.\"\n\nWhat comes next?\n\nThere are additional hearings on Friday, Nov. 15, and next week from Nov. 19 to Nov. 21. See the full schedule here."

Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., made a deportation moratorium part of his immigration plan.\n\nThe response from Senator Warren, D-Mass., came after a question at a town hall in North Carolina. A woman, who spoke in Spanish, told Warren about her husband, who she says was arrested for drug possession, served his sentence and was then detained by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). She asked if any moratorium would include those with criminal records.\n\nSANDERS' IMMIGRATION PLAN: HALT DEPORTATIONS, ABOLISH ICE, WELCOME 50K 'CLIMATE MIGRANTS,' GIVE WELFARE TO ALL\n\n\u894do I am open to suspending deportations, particularly as a way to push Congress for comprehensive immigration reform,?Warren responded. \u8942 believe that what we\u8ab6e doing right now, with ICE focusing on people who do not pose a threat -- that when ICE comes into our communities, takes our neighbors, our friends, our family members -- that they do not make this country safer.?\nWarren said she wants ICE to focus on things like fighting terrorism and tackling the import of drugs such as fentanyl.

        "title": "What We've Learned From Impeachment Inquiry",
        "text": "While the House has been conducting an impeachment inquiry, President Donald Trump and others in his administration have kept their focus on the White House-released memo on Trump's July 25 phone call with the Ukrainian president, claiming that simply reading the \"transcript\" is all that's needed to evaluate the impeachment probe. But congressional testimony has revealed key pieces of information beyond that conversation.\n\nTrump questioned the need for any more testimony in an Oct. 29 tweet, saying, \"How many more Never Trumpers will be allowed to testify about a perfectly appropriate phone call when all anyone has to do is READ THE TRANSCRIPT!\"\n\nVice President Mike Pence similarly twice said in an Oct. 28 \"PBS NewsHour\" interview that if the American people \"read the transcript,\" they \"will see the president did nothing wrong. There was no quid pro quo.\"\n\nEarlier this month, on Oct. 2, Trump said, \"The whistleblower was wrong. The only thing that matters is the transcript of the actual conversation that I had with the president of Ukraine. It was perfect.\" (The transcript actually backed up the three main points the whistleblower made about the July phone call, as we've written before.)\n\nThe House Democrats' inquiry concerns Trump's decision to withhold appropriated security aid to Ukraine and whether he did so to pressure Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate Democrats and former Vice President Joe Biden, a potential 2020 political rival.\n\nTrump's July 25 phone call was one of the events described in an Aug. 12 whistleblower complaint. Trump, according to the White House memo on the call, told Zelensky the U.S. \"has been very very good to Ukraine\" and asked for \"a favor,\" that Zelensky look into CrowdStrike, the cybersecurity firm hired by the Democratic National Committee after its computer network was hacked by Russian intelligence officers. That's an apparent reference to a debunked conspiracy theory.\n\nIn his phone call, Trump also asked Zelensky to investigate Biden and his son, Hunter. As we've written, Trump has distorted the facts when he has claimed that Joe Biden, as vice president, threatened to withhold \"billions of dollars to Ukraine\" unless it removed the prosecutor general who \"was prosecuting\" Biden's son, Hunter, and Burisma, the Ukrainian gas company on whose board Hunter Biden had served. There's no evidence Hunter Biden was ever being investigated or prosecuted. \n\nBut the House impeachment probe has revealed that several government officials raised concerns about Trump's phone call and actions before and after the call.\n\nWhile the testimony so far has occurred behind closed doors, many of the prepared opening statements have been released, and some details of the sessions have been reported by the press. The House is set to vote on a resolution on Oct. 31 that would set the rules for the next phase of the impeachment inquiry.\n\nHere are several key moments we have learned regarding Trump's dealings with Ukraine.\n\nWhat Was Left Out of the \u2018Transcript'\nTime after time, Trump has falsely claimed that the White House released an \"exact word-for-word transcript\" or \"verbatim transcript\" of his July 25 phone call with Zelensky.\n\nBut as we've written before, the White House memo of the call includes a \"caution\" note saying it \"is not a verbatim transcript.\" It is the \"notes and recollections,\" it said, of staff \"assigned to listen and memorialize the conversation.\"\n\nEllipses are used three times in the memo, seeming to indicate missing words.\n\nAnd we have now learned that there were certain parts of Trump's conversation with Zelensky that were not documented in the memo.\n\nThe New York Times, citing three unnamed sources, reported that, in private testimony before House impeachment investigators on Oct. 29, Lt. Col. Alexander S. Vindman, a Ukraine expert on the White House's National Security Council who listened in on the July 25 call, testified that certain words and phrases were omitted and that his subsequent attempt to have them included was not successful.\n\n\"The omissions, Colonel Vindman said, included Mr. Trump's assertion that there were recordings of former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. discussing Ukraine corruption, and an explicit mention by Ukraine's president, Volodymyr Zelensky, of Burisma Holdings, the energy company whose board employed Mr. Biden's son Hunter,\" the Times said. The newspaper also reported that Vindman \"tried to change the reconstructed transcript made by the White House staff to reflect the omissions. But while some of his edits appeared to have been successful, he said, those two corrections were not made.\"\n\nVindman reportedly said that at the point in the memo where the third set of ellipses appears, Trump mentioned there being tapes of Biden \u2014 which the Times said was \"an apparent reference\" to Biden's comments at a January 2018 event about his efforts as vice president to get Ukraine to force out Viktor Shokin as its prosecutor general.\n\nAccording to the memo, Trump said, \"There's a lot of talk about Biden's son, that Biden stopped the prosecution and a lot of people want to find out about that so whatever you can do with the Attorney General would be great. Biden went around bragging that he stopped the prosecution so if you can look into it \u2026 It sounds horrible to me.\" (As we've written, Biden didn't brag about stopping \"the prosecution.\")  \n\nIn his opening statement to House investigators, Vindman said he was concerned by the call and reported those concerns to the NSC's legal counsel.\n\n\"I did not think it was proper to demand that a foreign government investigate a U.S. citizen, and I was worried about the implications for the U.S. government's support of Ukraine. I realized that if Ukraine pursued an investigation into the Bidens and Burisma, it would likely be interpreted as a partisan play which would undoubtedly result in Ukraine losing the bipartisan support it has thus far maintained. This would all undermine U.S. national security,\" he said.\n\n\u2018Two Channels' of U.S. Policy-Making in Ukraine\nIt was known long before the whistleblower's complaint that New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani, the president's private lawyer, was working in Ukraine on behalf of his client. In May, the New York Times reported that Giuliani planned to visit Ukraine to encourage Zelensky to \"pursue inquiries\" involving political matters that could help Trump's 2020 reelection: \"One is the origin of the special counsel's investigation into Russia's interference in the 2016 election. The other is the involvement of former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr.'s son in a gas company owned by a Ukrainian oligarch.\"\n\nBut the impeachment inquiry has shed light on Giuliani's influence on U.S. policy toward Ukraine inside the administration.\n\nIn his Oct. 22 opening statement to the House committees, William B. Taylor, the charg\u00e9 d'affaires at the U.S. Embassy in Ukraine, said there were \"two channels of U.S. policy-making and implementation\" in Ukraine, which he called \"regular\" and \"highly irregular.\"\n\n\"[T]he irregular policy channel I had come to understand was guided by Mr. Giuliani,\" Taylor said, and included Energy Secretary Rick Perry; Gordon Sondland, the U.S. ambassador to the European Union; and Kurt Volker, Trump's special envoy to Ukraine at the time. \n\nTaylor, who spent his career in public service and had been ambassador to Ukraine from 2006 to 2009, was tapped for his current job by Secretary of State Mike Pompeo after Marie Yovanovitch's assignment as U.S. ambassador to Ukraine was cut short in May.\n\nThis is how Taylor described the U.S. policy toward Ukraine when he arrived in Kyiv in June:\n\nTaylor, Oct. 22: There appeared to be two channels of U.S. policy-making and implementation, one regular and one highly irregular. As the Chief of Mission, I had authority over the regular, formal diplomatic processes, including the bulk of the U.S. effort to support Ukraine against the Russian invasion and to help it defeat corruption. This regular channel of U.S. policy-making has consistently had strong, bipartisan support both in Congress and in all administrations since Ukraine's independence from Russia in 1991.\n\nAt the same time, however, there was an irregular, informal channel of U.S. policy-making with respect to Ukraine, one which included then-Special Envoy Kurt Volker, Ambassador Sondland, Secretary of Energy Rick Perry, and as I subsequently learned, Mr. Giuliani. I was clearly in the regular channel, but I was also in the irregular one to the extent that Ambassadors Volker and Sondland included me in certain conversations. Although this irregular channel was well-connected in Washington, it operated mostly outside of official State Department channels. This irregular channel began when Ambassador Volker, Ambassador Sondland, Secretary Perry, and Senator Ron Johnson briefed President Trump on May 23 upon their return from President Zelenskyy's inauguration.\n\nIn particular, Taylor said the \"irregular channel\" was working with the president to pressure Zelensky to state publicly that Ukraine would investigate Trump's political rivals. That pressure included the withholding of U.S. security aid. \n\n\"I became increasingly concerned,\" Taylor testified, \"that our relationship with Ukraine was being fundamentally undermined by an irregular, informal channel of U.S. policy-making and by the withholding of vital security assistance for domestic political reasons.\"\n\nTaylor Tied Aid to Investigations\nIn his testimony, Taylor described in detail how he came to believe that security aid to Ukraine and a White House meeting for Ukrainian President Zelensky were being tied to Ukraine's willingness to conduct investigations concerning Burisma and the 2016 election.\n\nTaylor said he first learned at a July 18 NSC meeting that the security aid was being held up at the direction of the president. \"In an instant, I realized that one of the key pillars of our strong support for Ukraine was threatened. The irregular policy channel was running contrary to the goals of longstanding U.S. policy,\" he said.\n\nA day later, Volker put Giuliani in touch with Andrey Yermak, a close aide to Zelensky, according to Volker's Oct. 3 prepared written testimony and a text message posted to Twitter by Giuliani. In his opening remarks, Volker said Giuliani talked to Yermak about the need for Zelensky to issue a public statement that \"would reference Burisma and 2016, in a wider context of rooting out corruption.\"\n\nOn Aug. 16, Yermak showed Volker a draft of an anti-corruption statement that \"did not mention Burisma or 2016 elections.\" Volker said he found it \"perfectly reasonable\" and Sondland, the U.S. ambassador to the European Union, \"agreed it was an excellent statement.\" But Giuliani criticized it, saying \"the statement should include specific reference to \u2018Burisma' and \u20182016,'\" Volker said.\n\nThe idea of putting out an anti-corruption statement was shelved at around that time, Volker told the House committees. But Taylor testified that it continued into September.\n\nOn Sept. 1, Sondland told Taylor that military aid for Ukraine also was contingent on \"such investigations.\"\n\n\"[T]he push to make President Zelenskyy publicly commit to investigations of Burisma and alleged interference in the 2016 election showed how the official foreign policy of the United States was undercut by the irregular efforts led by Mr. Giuliani,\" Taylor said.\n\nIn his testimony, Taylor said that National Security Council aide Tim Morrison told him on Sept. 7 about a phone call earlier that day between Sondland and Trump. \"According to Mr. Morrison, President Trump told Ambassador Sondland that he was not asking for a \u2018quid pro quo.' But President Trump did insist that President Zelenskyy go to a microphone and say he is opening investigations of Biden and 2016 election interference, and that President Zelenskyy should want to do this himself,\" Taylor said.\n\nThe next day, Sondland and Taylor spoke on the phone. Sondland told Taylor that Trump was \"adamant that President Zelenskyy, himself, had to \u2018clear things up and do it in public.'\"\n\n\"Ambassador Sondland said that he had talked to President Zelenskyy and Mr. Yermak and told them that, although this was not a quid pro quo, if President Zelenskyy did not \u2018clear things up' in public, we would be at a \u2018stalemate.'\" Taylor said.\n\n\"I understood a \u2018stalemate' to mean that Ukraine would not receive the much-needed military assistance,\" Taylor said. \"Ambassador Sondland said that this conversation concluded with President Zelenskyy agreeing to make a public statement in an interview with CNN.\"\n\nAccording to Taylor, Sondland described the arrangement in business terms.\n\n\"When a businessman is about to sign a check to someone who owes him something,\" Taylor recalled Sondland telling him, \"the businessman asks that person to pay up before signing the check.\" In his testimony, Taylor said he told Sondland \"the Ukrainians did not \u2018owe' President Trump anything, and holding up security assistance for domestic political gain was \u2018crazy.'\"\n\nIn a Sept. 9 text message, Taylor told Sondland: \"As I said on the phone, I think it's crazy to withhold security assistance for help with a political campaign.\" After receiving that text message, Sondland called Trump. \"I asked the President: \u2018What do you want from Ukraine?' The President responded, \u2018Nothing. There is no quid pro quo.' The President repeated: \u2018no quid pro quo' multiple times,\" Sondland said in his opening statement to the committees on Oct. 17. \"This was a very short call. And I recall the President was in a bad mood.\"\n\nSondland then sent this text to Taylor: \"Bill, I believe you are incorrect about President Trump's intentions. The President has been crystal clear no quid pro quo's of any kind. The President is trying to evaluate whether Ukraine is truly going to adopt the transparency and reforms that President Zelensky promised during his campaign. I suggest we stop the back and forth by text If you still have concerns I recommend you give Lisa Kenna or S a call to discuss them directly.\"\n\nOn the same day, Michael Atkinson, the inspector general of the intelligence community, notified the House intelligence committee about the whistleblower's complaint. Two days later, the Trump administration released the security aid to Ukraine.\n\nAt that point, Taylor said he \"reminded Mr. Yermak of the high strategic value of bipartisan support for Ukraine and the importance of not getting involved in other countries' elections. My fear at the time was that since Ambassador Sondland had told me President Zelenskyy already agreed to do a CNN interview, President Zelenskyy would make a statement regarding \u2018investigations' that would have played into domestic U.S. politics.\"\n\nAt Taylor's urging, he said, aides to Zelensky confirmed he would not do the CNN interview.\n\nBolton Opposed Mixing Politics with Diplomacy\nOne of the major revelations coming from the impeachment inquiry so far involves Trump's former national security adviser, John Bolton.\n\nBolton replaced H.R. McMaster as national security adviser in April 2018, but left office abruptly in mid-September after a falling out with Trump. In a Sept. 10 tweet, Trump said, \"I informed John Bolton last night that his services are no longer needed at the White House. I disagreed strongly with many of his suggestions, as did others in the Administration.\" Bolton disputed the president's version of events in a tweet that same day: \"I offered to resign last night and President Trump said, \u2018Let's talk about it tomorrow.'\"\n\nOne of the disagreements was over Ukraine policy, as described by at least two witnesses before the House committees overseeing the impeachment inquiry.\n\nIn his prepared opening statement, Taylor recalled being told by Fiona Hill and Alexander Vindman, who were National Security Council officials at the time, that Bolton ended a July 10 meeting with Ukrainian officials over concern about the administration mixing politics with diplomacy. At that meeting, Sondland tied a possible Oval Office visit between Trump and Ukrainian President Zelensky with \"investigations\" \u2014 prompting Bolton to end the meeting, Taylor said.\n\n\"Specifically, they told me that Ambassador Sondland had connected \u2018investigations' with an Oval Office meeting for President Zelenskyy, which so irritated Ambassador Bolton that he abruptly ended the meeting, telling Dr. Hill and Mr. Vindman that they should have nothing to do with domestic politics,\" Taylor said of a July 19 conversation he had with Hill and Vindman. Bolton \"also directed Dr. Hill to \u2018brief the lawyers.' Dr. Hill said that Ambassador Bolton referred to this as a \u2018drug deal' after the July 10 meeting. Ambassador Bolton opposed a call between President Zelenskyy and President Trump out of concern that it \u2018would be a disaster,'\" Taylor said.\n\nIn her Oct. 14 testimony, Hill corroborated Taylor's recollection of Bolton's response to the July 10 meeting. The New York Times, in an account of Hill's testimony, quoted Bolton as telling her: \"I am not part of whatever drug deal Sondland and Mulvaney are cooking up.\" She also told congressional investigators that Bolton told her: \"Giuliani's a hand grenade who's going to blow everybody up.\"\n\nBut Sondland disputed media reports of Hill's account. \"To put it clearly: Neither she nor Ambassador Bolton shared any critical comments with me, even after our July 10, 2019 White House meeting,\" Sondland said in his Oct. 17 prepared opening statement to the House committees.\n\nHowever, a third witness, Christopher J. Anderson, who was Volker's special adviser for Ukraine negotiations from August 2017 until July 12, also told the House committees that Bolton had concerns about Giuliani's involvement in Ukraine policy.\n\nIn his Oct. 30 prepared opening remarks, Anderson said he and Volker met with Bolton on June 13 to discuss improving relations with Ukraine. At that meeting, Anderson said Bolton \"cautioned [them] that Mr. Giuliani was a key voice with the President on Ukraine which could be an obstacle\" to their efforts in Ukraine.\n\nTrump Aides Held \u2018Positive Views' of Zelensky, But Not Trump\nTrump has maintained that one of the reasons he withheld security aid to Ukraine was because of concerns about corruption in the country. He told reporters on Sept. 23, \"We want to make sure that country is honest. It's very important to talk about corruption. If you don't talk about corruption, why would you give money to a country that you think is corrupt?\" His acting chief of staff, Mick Mulvaney, said in an Oct. 20 interview that Ukraine received the aid \"[o]nce we were able to satisfy ourselves that corruption was actually \u2014 they were doing better with it.\"\n\nBut congressional testimony has shown that his top aides thought Zelensky was aggressively addressing corruption.\n\nSondland said in his Oct. 17 prepared opening statement that the U.S. delegation to Zelensky's inauguration on May 20 \"developed positive views of the new Ukraine President and his desire \u2026 to address Ukraine's well-known and longstanding corruption issues.\"\n\nThree days later, on May 23, Sondland and other members of that delegation met with Trump to share that view. Sondland said they asked Trump to call Zelensky and host a visit with him. \"However, President Trump was skeptical that Ukraine was serious about reforms and anti-corruption, and he directed those of us present at the meeting to talk to Mr. Giuliani, his personal attorney, about his concerns,\" Sondland testified. \"It was apparent to all of us that the key to changing the President's mind on Ukraine was Mr. Giuliani.\"\n\nVolker, the U.S. special envoy to Ukraine and another member of that delegation to Zelensky's inauguration, made similar remarks in his congressional testimony, saying that in the May 23 meeting with Trump, \"We stressed our finding that President Zelenskyy represented the best chance for getting Ukraine out of the mire of corruption it had been in for over 20 years.\" Volker said that Trump was \"very skeptical.\" The president said Ukraine was \"full of \u2018terrible people'\" who \"'tried to take me down,'\" Volker recalled, adding that Trump's \"negative view\" was \"rooted in the past,\" and that Trump was \"clearly receiving other information from other sources, including Mayor Giuliani.\"\n\nTaylor also testified that he saw \"encouraging\" signs that Zelensky was serious about fighting corruption soon after Taylor assumed his post on June 17.\n\nZelensky \"had appointed reformist ministers and supported long-stalled anti-corruption legislation. He took quick executive action, including opening Ukraine's High Anti-Corruption Court, which was established under the previous presidential administration but never allowed to operate,\" Taylor said. \"With his new parliamentary majority, President Zelenskyy changed the Ukrainian constitution to remove absolute immunity from Rada deputies, which had been the source of raw corruption for two decades. There was much excitement in Kyiv that this time things could be different \u2014 a new Ukraine might finally be breaking from its corrupt, post-Soviet past.\""

        "text": "House Speaker Cameron Sexton says in light of an attorney general opinion released this week, he will not move forward with any expulsion effort against Rep. David Byrd.\n\nIn a new opinion, Tennessee Attorney General Herbert Slatery said expelling a lawmaker for conduct that took place before entering office is inadvisable but also not prohibited.\n\nThe opinion comes in response to a request from Sexton on whether lawmakers could expel Byrd from office over decades-old sexual assault allegations. \n\nByrd, R-Waynesboro, has been accused by three women of sexually assaulting them more than three decades ago while they were players on the high school basketball team he coached.\n\nThough Byrd was first elected to the House in 2014, the allegations against him were not made public until spring 2018. He won reelection by a large margin last fall, though the news of the sexual assault allegations broke just weeks before the deadline for a primary opponent to file.\n\nJust before he was officially sworn in to the role in August, Sexton, R-Crossville, requested the opinion from Slatery on whether the legislature could vote to expel a member for conduct that predates a representative's time in office.\n\n\"Historical practice, sound policy considerations, and constitutional restraints counsel against, but do not absolutely prohibit, the exercise of the legislature\u8ab7 expulsion power to oust a member for conduct that occurred before he was elected and that was known to the member\u8ab7 constituents when they elected him,\" Slatery wrote in the opinion issued Tuesday.\n\nIn a statement Wednesday, Sexton said that because Slatery \"counsels against\" expulsion in such a scenario, he would not move to support a vote to expel Byrd.\n\n\"After consulting with House leadership and our committee chairmen, we will heed Attorney General Slatery\u8ab7 advice and not move forward,\" Sexton said.\n\nHowever, Rep. Michael Curcio, R-Dickson and chairman of the judiciary committee, said Wednesday that if a resolution is filed to expel Byrd this session, he will hold a hearing ?as Curcio first announced on the House floor during an August special session ?to investigate Byrd and compel testimony.\n\n\"I have been advised by my legal counsel that as the legislature is not currently in session, no committee can take action without a charge from the Speaker of the House, and based upon the Attorney General's opinion, the Speaker will not be granting such a charge to the House Judiciary Committee on this matter,\" Curcio said in a statement.\n\nBut the judiciary chairman said in an interview that because he can set the calendar for his committee, he would agree to hold such a hearing if a relevant resolution is filed.\n\nRep. Gloria Johnson, D-Knoxville, said Wednesday she would be filing a resolution to expel Byrd ?as she did for the special session ?for when the legislature returns in January.\n\n\"It will be re-filed,\" Johnson said. \"There's no question there.\"\n\nNew House speaker opposed vote on expulsion\nThe attorney general's office notes in its opinion that the only historical precedent for expelling lawmakers in Tennessee is based on a member's conduct while in office, pointing to then-Rep. Jeremy Durham's \"disorderly conduct\" in 2016, Rep. Bob Fisher's bribery conviction in 1980, and six members in 1866 who were found in \"contempt of the authority\" of the House.\n\nSexton has previously said he was against putting Byrd's expulsion up for a vote, noting that his constituents had reelected him even after the allegations surfaced.\n\nHe requested the opinion from Slatery amid questions this summer about whether Sexton would attempt to block a Democrat-led expulsion attempt during the legislature's August special session.\n\nWhile Byrd told fellow House Republican Caucus members in August that he would not be seeking reelection, he has refused to make any public statement about his plans or confirm to reporters that he intends to do so.\n\nByrd did not return a request for comment from The Tennessean about his plans."

It definitely happened?\"\n\n\"It absolutely happened,\" said Haley. \"And instead of saying that to me, they should've been saying that to the president, not asking me to join them on their sidebar plan. It should've been, 'Go tell the president what your differences are, and quit if you don't like what he's doing.' But to undermine a president is really a very dangerous thing. And it goes against the Constitution, and it goes against what the American people want. And it was offensive.\"\n\n[We asked them to respond. John Kelly tells \"Sunday Morning\": \"If by resistance and stalling she means putting a staff process in place ?to ensure the (president) knew all the pros and cons of what policy decision he might be contemplating so he could make an informed decision, then guilty as charged.\"]\n\nHaley remains a fierce Trump loyalist, including on the issue of his asking the Ukrainian president to dig for dirt on the family of Democratic candidate Joe Biden.\n\nO'Donnell asked, \"Do you think ultimately the president will be impeached and removed from office?\"\n\nHaley replied, \"No. On what? You're gonna impeach a president for asking for a favor that didn't happen and giving money and it wasn't withheld? I don't know what you would impeach him on. And look, Norah, impeachment is, like, the death penalty for a public official. When you look at the transcript, there's nothing in that transcript that warrants the death penalty for the president.\"\n\n\"To be clear, it was not a complete transcript. There are still things that are missing from it. And in it, he does say, 'I would like you to do us a favor, though.'\"\n\n\"The Ukrainians never did the investigation. And the president released the funds. I mean, when you look at those, there's just nothing impeachable there. And more than that, I think the biggest thing that bothers me is the American people should decide this. Why do we have a bunch of people in Congress making that decision?\"\n\nHaley, herself a daughter of immigrants, also defends President Trump on one of him most inflammatory statements: his tweet from this past summer in which he told four Democratic female members of Congress, three of whom were born in the United States, to \"Go back and help fix the totally broken and crime infested places from which they came.\"\n\nWas that appropriate?  \"No, it's not appropriate,\" Haley replied. \"But I also can appreciate where he was coming from, from the standpoint of, don't bash America over and over and over again and not do something to try and fix it.\"\n\nHaley insists she has no immediate plans to run for any office, including the presidency, and as she departed the Trump administration last year she said, \"I can promise you what I'll be doing is campaigning for this one.\"\n\nShe told O'Donnell, \"A year is a long time in politics. It really is a lifetime in politics. And so, I think what's best for me is take it a year at a time and see what happens.\"\n\nWith her new book, lucrative speaking engagements, and a seat on the corporate board of Boeing, Nikki Haley acknowledges there are still chapters to be written:  \"I'm too young to stop fighting. I'll always be out there. I'll always use the power of my voice for what I believe is good.\""

Doug Jones (D-Ala.). Sessions launched his campaign by releasing an advertisement that appealed directly to what he viewed as the many accomplishments from the Trump administration. \n\nHe also tried to separate himself from other past Cabinet members, stating, \"When I left President Trump's Cabinet, did I write a tell-all book? No.\"\n\n\"Did I go on CNN and attack the president? Nope. Have I said a cross word about our president? Not one time,\" he said. \n\nTrump tapped Sessions to be his attorney general shortly after winning the 2016 election, praising him at the time as a \"world-class legal mind.\" But his views of the former senator quickly soured after Sessions recused himself from an investigation into Russia's election interference. Trump once described Sessions's Justice Department as a \"total joke.\"\n\nSessions agreed to resign at Trump's request following the 2018 midterm elections. \n\nAsked about Sessions's candidacy last week, Trump said that the White House has not \"gotten involved.\" \n\n\"I saw he said very nice things about me \u2026 But we'll have to see,\" Trump said. \"I haven't made a determination.\"\n\nTrump on Saturday attended the college football game between LSU and Alabama with Rep.

Adams said in her lawsuit that she stayed in touch with supervisors while out of state and \u896derformed some of her work duties?while in Seattle, then abruptly found out she\u8aa8 been \"terminated for insubordination and abandonment of her job.?\nAdams filed suit in 2017 and a jury found in her favor after she represented herself at trial, awarding her $1 million.\n\nA judge later pared that down to about $350,000. He also required that the Senate reinstate Adams.\n\nBut Adams told a federal court this month that negotiations with the Senate's lawyer had \"reached an impasse.\"\n\nThe Senate had already paid the private law firm Ryley, Carlock and Applewhite about $166,000 to handle the Adams case as of mid-September, according to court records.\n\nOn Friday, Adams described several points of disagreement, such as allowing her time to wind down her private legal practice, reinstating health benefits immediately, the assignment of a different supervisor and ensuring time after her firing still counts towards her retirement.\n\n\"I'm being treated as a new employee,\" she told the court.\n\nThat, in turn, would not amount to reinstatement, Adams argued.\n\nAdams also asked in a motion that the court calculate lost wages based on the $108,160-a-year salary of a white man in the same position but who was paid far more than her, rather than on her $60,000-a-year salary, underscoring the disparities among Senate staff.\n\nAdams said she would accept pay of about $113,000 a year, around the same rate as Republican policy advisers who have long been paid at a higher rate than Democratic colleagues.\n\nComing alongside other fairly technical motions, the request for a new trial may merely be an attempt to keep options open if the case remains at an impasse.\n\nBut Moberly told the court on Friday that they were closer to an agreement \"than is occasionally portrayed.\""

Nunes also accused Schiff of fabricating evidence in order to cast \"in a sinister light\" the telephone call at the inquiry's heart.\n\nTrump used the July 25 call - a rough transcript of which was released by the White House - to press Ukrainian President Volodymr Zelenskiy to investigate the Bidens.\n\nJoe Biden is a leading candidate for the Democratic nomination to oppose Trump's bid for re-election next year. While he served as vice president, his son was on the board of Burisma, a Ukrainian energy firm.\n\nThe whistleblower complaint alleged that Trump used the call to seek foreign help for personal political gain, a charge broadly substantiated by the testimonies of current and former U.S. officials in three weeks of closed hearings.\n\nTrump and his Republican allies deny there was any wrongdoing.\n\nShould the House impeach Trump, the Republican-controlled Senate would conduct a trial that could see him removed from office.\n\nNunes said he also wants testimony from Devon Archer, a businessman who served on the Burisma board with Hunter Biden, as the pair could \"assist the American public in understanding the nature and extent of Ukraine's pervasive corruption.\"\n\nTrump and his personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, have led accusations - without giving any evidence - that Joe Biden sought the dismissal of a Ukrainian prosecutor to block a corruption probe of Burisma.\n\nIn asking for the whistleblower, Nunes said that Trump \"should be afforded an opportunity to confront his accusers.\"\n\nIn a statement issued after receiving Nunes' letter, Schiff said the Republicans' proposed witness list was being evaluated. But, he indicated he likely will reject the requests for Hunter Biden, Archer and several other proposed witnesses.\n\nThe inquiry, he said, will not serve \"as a vehicle to undertake the same sham investigations into the Bidens or 2016 that the president pressed Ukraine to conduct for his personal political benefit or to facilitate the president's effort to threaten, intimidate and retaliate against the whistleblower.\"\n\nThe whistleblower alleged that Trump sought investigations into the Bidens in return for granting Zelenskiy an Oval Office visit and allowing the delivery of nearly $400 million in security aid needed by Ukraine to defend against Russia-backed separatists.\n\nBefore departing on Saturday on a flight to Tuscaloosa, Alabama, Trump said he probably would release on Tuesday the transcript of an April 21 call he made to congratulate Zelenskiy on his presidential election victory."

Day One\n\nThis is just Day One of the open testimony before the House Intelligence Committee. Open testimony is expected to last two weeks.\n\nInformation gathered in this open format and weeks of closed-door testimony will be sent to the House Judiciary Committee, where articles of impeachment will be drafted if there is sufficient evidence.\n\n2. Two witnesses\n\nWilliam Taylor is the top U.S. diplomat in Ukraine.  George Kent is a senior U.S. State Department official.  Kent was appointed to his position in September of 2018.  Taylor was first appointed ambassador to Ukraine by President George W. Bush and has since been reappointed by presidents Barack Obama and Donald Trump.\n\nWATCH LIVE: Trump impeachment hearings live stream, live updates\n3. New information\n\nIn Taylor's testimony, he restated much of what he told investigators privately. But he also offered new information -- saying an aide informed him that they had witnesses listening to a call July 26 between Trump and U.S. ambassador to the European Union Gordon Sondland.\n\nThe staff member overheard Trump on the call asking Sondland about \"the investigations.\" This came one day after Trump's call with Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky.\n\nTaylor added that after the call with Trump, \"the member of my staff asked Ambassador Sondland what President Trump thought about Ukraine, and Ambassador Sondland responded that President Trump cares more about the investigations of (Joe) Biden, which (Rudy) Giuliani was pressing for.\"\n\n4. Text messages\n\nCommittee members displayed text messages between Taylor and other diplomats. The texts, which were disclosed by former U.S. Special Representative for Ukraine Negotiations Kurt Volker, show what some diplomats said was a clear quid pro quo (Latin for \"a favor for a favor\"), with Trump using military aid and a visit to the White House as leverage to get Ukraine to look into Biden and his son ahead of the 2020 election.\n\nRead: Inside Day One of the Trump impeachment hearings\n5. Quid pro quo\n\nTaylor said he was told by Sondland that Trump was not doing a quid pro quo but was \"like a businessman who wants to be paid what he is owed before signing a new check.\"\n\nTaylor told the committee that what Sondland said did not make sense to him because \"Ukraine didn't owe Trump anything.\"\n\n6. Aid vs. meeting\n\nA White House meeting, while politically important for world leaders, is different from congressionally approved military aid to Ukraine to defend itself against Russian aggression in eastern Europe.\n\nRead: 9 things to know about impeachment\n7. Investigations\n\nTaylor in public and private testimony said Trump wanted Zelensky to appear on CNN and announce an investigation into the Bidens.\n\nThat interview was canceled after it was revealed that aid had been frozen and the White House released a partial transcript of the July phone call.\n\n8. Pence\n\nTaylor said Vice President Mike Pence grew alarmed about military aid being withheld for political investigations after Pence met with Zelensky in Warsaw, Poland.\n\n9. Russia\n\nRussia has been actively working to destabilize and control Ukraine.\n\nThe congressionally approved $400 million in military aid to Ukraine was designed to help Ukraine and its newly-elected president defend itself against Russia.\n\nUkraine is not a member of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization but has been working toward membership in the alliance."

        "title": "Analysis: Only 3 Senate Republicans aren't defending Trump from the impeachment inquiry. Here's why.",
        "text": "For those Senate Republicans who are refusing to condemn the House-led impeachment inquiry, three may be the loneliest number.\n\nWhile a resolution denouncing the House Democrats' fast-moving probe hasn't received a vote, GOP Sens. Mitt Romney of Utah, Susan Collins of Maine and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska declined to sign on as co-sponsors ?the only ones out of 53 Republicans ?leaving the door ajar to the possibility that they could vote to convict President Donald Trump if impeachment moves to its trial phase in the Senate.\n\nBut unlike the blowback Romney and Collins have faced for breaking with the party's defense of the president, Murkowski could end up seeing her part in this micro-rebellion embraced by voters in her state. Experts on Alaska politics told NBC News that the state tends to reward an independent streak in its politicians.\n\n\"As far as supporting or opposing the president, we support individualism and we support individual freedom of expression. And that goes for our politicians, too, whatever party they are,\" said Tuckerman Babcock, who retired as the chairman of the Alaska GOP last year. \"Republicans here may disagree with her on certain things, but I can say safely that they respect her independence of judgment.\"\n\nIn other words, Murkowski can fall out of line with Trump ?but not fall out of favor with Republican voters in her state.\n\nMurkowski voted against the Senate's Trump-backed effort to repeal Obamacare in 2017, but later came out in support of repealing the Obamacare individual mandate. She voted against the confirmation of Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh but backed Trump\u8ab7 tax cut bill. And she votes in line with the president's position on bills about 75 percent of the time, according to a FiveThirtyEight tally.\n\nMurkowski also benefits from not being up for re-election for three years and from the strong financial backing she has always received from Alaska Native corporations and interest groups, an influential Alaska constituency.\n\n\"These things give her the leeway to vote with her heart so often,\" Chanda Meek, a professor of political science at the University of Alaska-Fairbanks who studies Alaska politics, told NBC News.\n\nDownload the NBC News app for breaking news and politics\n\nOn the other hand, Murkowski's political rivals point out that across her three Senate races (in 2004, 2010 and 2016), she has never won a majority of the vote ?a fact they say signals that there will always be room for a more conservative candidate to mount a challenge when she is up for re-election.\n\nBut even those adversaries admit that the unique nature of Alaska politics is likely to enable Murkowski to follow the facts on impeachment ?even if the Republican voters oppose it.\n\n\"When it comes to the rank and file, I believe strongly that impeachment is looked upon with great disdain and as a reflection of how the system is totally broken,\" said Joe Miller, a conservative attorney who ran against Murkowski in 2010 and the 2016. \"Because she's so clearly outside the Republican mainstream (her) position is secure because the Republican Party here is just so broad.\"\n\nMurkowski has said that she wouldn't support the Sen. Lindsey Graham's resolution condemning the impeachment inquiry because \"it's not the Senate's role to dictate to the House how to determine their own rules.\"\n\nHer office repeatedly declined to answer questions from NBC News about her position, pointing instead back to the senator's previous statement about not signing on to the resolution.\n\n\"From the get-go, Speaker Pelosi and House Democrats have handled this impeachment inquiry poorly, from closed-door hearings and leaked information to the outright abandonment of decades of established precedent on due process for the accused,\" Murkowski said in that statement. \"A serious lack of transparency will hardly build public trust or credibility for the House's actions. As awful as their process is, the formal impeachment inquiry lies in the House, and it's not the Senate\u8ab7 role to dictate to the House how to determine their own rules.\"\n\nThat statement differed starkly with Romney\u8ab7 sharply worded criticism of Trump's dealings with Ukraine. The 72-year-old former Republican presidential nominee tweeted that \"the President's brazen and unprecedented appeal to China and to Ukraine to investigate Joe Biden is wrong and appalling.\"\n\nThose actions, however, had the effect of isolating Romney from his fellow Senate Republicans and from GOP voters in his own state, many of whom told NBC News last month that they strongly disapproved of his digs at the president and his passive reception of the House impeachment inquiry.\n\nCollins, meanwhile, faces even a potential stronger backlash from Maine voters, because she's up for re-election next year.\n\nA top target of Democrats in 2020 as they try to flip the GOP-controlled Senate, Collins last month called Trump\u8ab7 public request for China to investigate Biden \"completely inappropriate\" but has noted she won't take a position on impeachment because she might be asked to serve as essentially a juror during a possible trial in the Senate. Public hearings in the House's inquiry are set to begin next week, and if the chamber votes to impeach, a Senate trial could begin next month.\n\nThat position seems to have alienated many conservatives who want to see their lawmakers defend Trump from the impeachment inquiry: Her once sky-high favorability ratings have fallen.\n\nMurkowski, however, seems likely to be able to avoid those kind of consequences, for the time being.\n\n\"She'll be able to do her homework, as she always does, remain cautious, follow the facts,\" said Meek, of the University of Alaska-Fairbanks. \"When the time comes, (she'll) make a strategic decision about whether the alleged abuse of power is important enough for her to take on that she'll have a lot of national Republicans coming after her.\n\n\"That,\" Meek added, \"hasn\u8ab8 stopped her in the past."

        "text": "Nationwide, San Fernando Valley Rep. Brad Sherman is perhaps best known as the first congressmen to introduce articles of impeachment against President Donald Trump.\n\nIn that filing, introduced in July of 2017, Sherman, D-Sherman Oaks, charged that the president obstructed justice by firing FBI Director James Comey, who was leading an investigation into the Trump campaign's alleged collusion with Russian officials during the 2016 election.\n\nMore than two years later, the House of Representatives voted Oct. 31 to make public an ongoing impeachment inquiry into the president. But instead of obstruction, the House's probe has centered on whether the Trump administration tried to leverage the Ukrainian government to investigate his Democratic political rival Joe Biden. \n\nWhile Sherman's initial impeachment effort gained little traction in Congress, he says it helped lead to this moment \u2014 just days before the process goes into a new public phase \u2014 by sparking a necessary discussion about holding Trump to account.\n\n\"If he thought he was immune from impeachment, God knows what he would have done to the country,\" Sherman told the Daily News in an interview. \"So this isn't just a matter of politics; this is a matter of restraining a president who is very hard to restrain.\"\n\nSherman, who serves as a senior member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee and participated in the Democrat-led inquiry's closed-door hearings, has remained an outspoken backer of impeachment, often appearing on cable news to advocate the case against the president.\n\nHe says the probe, which began in September, has found clear evidence that the administration sought to withhold military aid from the Ukrainian government in exchange for announcing an investigation into the Biden family's business dealings in the country. Trump likely perceived Biden as his biggest threat in 2020.\n\nTrump has repeatedly said the inquiry is a \"hoax\" and that there was nothing wrong about a phone call between Ukraine's president and Trump, which impeachment investigators say was part of the evidence showing that Trump and his administration bribed a foreign leader.\n\nAs recently as Saturday, he called the effort \"presidential harrassment\" in a tweet.\n\nBut Sherman said there's a line between making it clear that a foreign country needs to act on something in the nation's public interest versus making that same demand for self-interest, or for a political campaign.\n\n \n\n\"It's not uncommon for us to condition our aid on another country doing something,\" Sherman said. \"But that something needs to help all Americans. We don't say, \u2018Give a big contribution to the political party or campaign of the president.'\"\n\nLast week, House investigators released the transcripts of closed-door depositions from current and former administration officials, which Democrats say corroborate and expand upon the original whistleblower complaint that set off inquiry. The House Intelligence Committee will hold open hearings starting next week, featuring testimony from three key witnesses in the probe.\n\nSherman sees the televised hearings as an opportunity to further educate the public on the inquiry's findings.\n\n\"It's the difference between reading the book and seeing the movie,\" he said. \"For most Americans, the movie is more interesting.\"\n\nThe goal, he said, is to solidify public support for impeachment before a trial in the Republican-led Senate.\n\n\"We'd need about a third of Republican senators to vote for removal this Spring,\" Sherman said. \"Right now, it's hard to say there's more than a handful that are even listening seriously. But if we get public opinion, their ears will open.\"\n\nAccording to the latest USC Dornsife/Los Angeles Times poll, 44% of Americans say the House should vote to impeach while 30% say it should not\u201426% percent  remain undecided.\n\nStill, Sherman appears less than optimistic that Trump will ultimately be convicted.\n\n\"Look, am I predicting that the Senate will vote to remove\u2026 no,\" he added.\n\nBut even if Trump remains in office, Sherman says an open impeachment trial could succeed in putting the president's defenders in a difficult position as election season approaches.\n\n\"Republicans won't be able to say there was no quid pro quo,\" he said. \"They'll have to say, \u2018I'm voting not to remove,' and they'll have to explain that.\"\n\nWhen asked whether articles of impeachment should include other instances of Trump's alleged misconduct, Sherman initially demurred.\n\n\"That's above my paygrade,\" he said. \"Now I comment on things above my paygrade all of the time, but only when I've got something clear to say.\"\n\nBut after discussing the public's response to the Comey firing and special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election, his thinking appeared to shift.\n\n\"It's counterintuitive, but what [Trump] did vis-\u00e0-vis Ukraine, he did secretly, and he did through back channels,\" Sherman said. \"That makes it easier to explain to the American people\u2014he was doing it secretly because he knew it was wrong.\"\n\n\"In this conversation, I have convinced myself, while there are arguments on both sides, that a simple article of impeachment focused on the Ukraine might be the one that public best understands.\"\n\nAs for his constituents, Sherman said he's found most people in his district back impeachment. (Only 26% of voters in the district supported Trump in 2016.)\n\n\"Walking around Ralph's, people come up to me and they appreciate the fact that I was the first to offer articles of impeachment,\" he said.\n\nWhen asked about constituents who may feel there are more pressing issues than impeachment, he pointed to his work supporting the recent House resolution to recognize the Armenian Genocide and his efforts in the Foreign Affairs Committee to keep Syria from obtaining a nuclear weapon.\n\n\"People have to keep in mind we're doing a lot in the House,\" he said. \"What will happen is we'll work all day on one thing\u2014and there's 435 of us working on many different things\u2014and then the press will get a comment from one member of Congress about impeachment and that's the only thing they'll mention.\"\n\n(Sherman's office reached out to the Daily News to notify the paper about his availability to speak on the impeachment inquiry.)\n\nOn Sunday, Sherman will host a town hall event at Millikan Middle School in Sherman Oaks ahead of the open hearings next week. He expects Valley residents to be eager to learn more about the impeachment inquiry.\n\nBut whatever ultimately comes of impeachment, he also wants voters to understand the stakes of 2020.\n\n\"I've been telling people for years that the next election that's coming is the most important election of our generation. This time I'm not lying. 2020 is it.\"\n\nThe Valley Town Hall Meeting will take place at Millikan Middle School, 5041 Sunnyslope Ave., Sherman Oaks, from 3 p.m. to 4:30 pm.\n"

        "text": "Opinion by: Saagar Enjeti\n\nA very interesting thing happened yesterday. It appeared that neoliberal shapeshifter Pete Buttigieg reconciled himself with the failed legacy of Barack Obama and offered a new path.\n\nButtigieg appeared to have been quoted by an LA Times reporter discussing how he would respond to \"the failures of the Obama era help explain how we got Trump.\" The quote was widely circulated on Twitter, Julian Castro took the opportunity to hit Pete Buttigieg on it, all before Monday morning when it was corrected.\n\nThe story of that correction and the response perfectly describes Buttigieg and his candidacy. Buttigieg's actual quote was, \"the failures of the old normal help explain how we got Trump.\" That of course is a completely meaningless anodyne phrase.\n\nEven better, Buttigieg himself quote tweeted the reporter who issued the correction saying, \"I appreciate this reporter's swift and honest correction of a misquote on my views of the Obama presidency. From health care to DADT repeal to the rescue of the auto industry, my appreciation of Barack Obama comes from a very personal place.\"\n\nOh Pete, you were so close to being right in the misquote that I almost had hope for you. Buttigieg's actual quote about the old normal followed by bending over backwards to talk about how much he loves Obama tells you everything you need to know about Pete Buttigeg. The truth is that Buttigieg's old normal pretty much looks like what a new normal under him would be. Lots of woke progressive executive orders while kowtowing to Wall Street and the neoliberal class in every other area of his presidency.\n\nTo give you an idea of who is supporting Pete Buttigieg listen to this perfect quote from Politico.\n\nGlenn Rockman, a 38 year old biotech investor from adjuvant capital in Manhattan says, \"I was shocked by the practical and substantive kind of centrist nature of his commentary and how inspirational I thought he could be. And basically, I hate how far left the primary has gone.\"\n\nYou can't make that up folks. A biotech investor at a Manhattan private equity firm with a recurring Buttigieg donation. It's almost too perfect. Politico gives up Buttigieg's entire game later on saying \"interviews with nearly a dozen Buttigieg backers in the investment community suggest the South Bend Mayor's mix of progressive stands on social issues and more moderate approaches to taxation, health care and the financial industry more broadly have kicked off a mini-movement among younger investor-types?\"\n\nSo to get this straight. People in the investment community are excited about Pete Buttigieg because they only have faith that he'll enact a bunch of socially liberal policies if he somehow manages to become President of the United States. He has the most billionaire donors of any other candidate in this race. And as I've said before, how you're funding your campaign and who is most excited about your candidacy tells us much tells us everything you need to know about you.\n\nWhat bothers me most about Buttigieg is his unabashed waffling, careerism, and his emptiness. It remains perfectly encapsulated in one of his first ads that we aired on this show which of course prompted raucous laughter from me and the panel. Let's relive that for old times sake.\n\nButtigieg began his campaign as a Medicare-for-all progressive mayor from the interior of the country. Now he's a centrist style Democrat who previous reports indicate dropped lines from his stump speech about abolishing the electoral college and packing the Supreme Court because his Wall Street donors told him that those things were just a tad too radical. His entire tactic in the Democratic race appears to be attacking people for being too far left and then saying very stupid meaningless things in a way that sounds nice to some boomers.\n\nButtigieg is the type of guy who's been salivating to be president of the United States since he was like 12, and it shows just a bit too much in his career choices. He wants to change the system, but he loves Obama, who is the face of the old system. In short, he doesn't really want to change anything at all."

They say it should be given to states to shore up election security ahead of next year.{mosads} \n\n\"Time has almost run out to provide states with the resources they need to protect the 2020 election,\" the groups wrote. \"The best opportunity for lawmakers to effectively secure our elections before 2020 is by including $600 million in directed appropriations for election security in the continuing resolution that will extend government funding past November 21, 2019\u2014when current government funding runs out.\"\n\nLawmakers are working on a stopgap measure that could last just into the first weeks of December.

The EAC expects around 85 percent of these funds to have been spent by states prior to the 2020 elections. \n\nThe letter on Tuesday was sent two weeks after almost 100 former members of Congress, ambassadors and top officials sent a separate letter to the Senate urging leaders to take action and pass various long-stalled election security bills and give states more funding for election security.\n\nThe former officials described foreign interference in American elections as \"a national security emergency.\""

        "text": "House impeachment investigators released the transcripts of three more depositions on Monday, offering critical new details surrounding President Donald Trump's order to freeze military aid to Ukraine.\n\nLaura Cooper, a deputy assistant secretary of Defense for Russia and Ukraine, told investigators Trump's abrupt hold on the critical security assistance sent all corners of the administration into a frenzy to get it released \u2014 and to understand what motivated Trump's decision.\n\nCooper's testimony \u2014 halted for hours when Republicans stormed the Intelligence Committee's hearing room in protest \u2014 provided a window into the urgent questions high-level officials raced to answer about Trump's move, including whether it violated any laws about distributing congressionally mandated appropriations.\n\nInvestigators also released transcripts of Catherine Croft's and Christopher Anderson's testimony. Croft and Anderson served as top aides to Kurt Volker, the former U.S. special representative for Ukraine negotiations. Both officials had visibility into the hold on military aid \u2014 including the extent to which Ukrainian officials knew of the hold before it was reported by POLITICO on Aug. 28.\n\nPOLITICO scoured the depositions for the following new or illuminating nuggets:\n\n### **Ukrainians may have been aware of hold on aid earlier than previously known**\n\nTrump abruptly withheld nearly $400 million in military aid sometime in early July, and word spread through the administration in subsequent weeks. Though several witnesses told lawmakers that Ukrainians likely didn't discover the hold until late August \u2014 after a POLITICO report revealed it \u2014 Cooper said she began to register concerns days or weeks earlier.\n\nSome, she said, arose from the defense industry that was awaiting the distribution of funds \u2014 including at least one call Cooper received from the Chamber of Commerce.\n\n\"So before the kind of press broke on it, we were hearing that there were signs of concern,\" Cooper said.\n\nBut it was a conversation Cooper had with Volker that led her to believe Ukrainians also knew about the hold on aid before it was reported.\"I knew from my Kurt Volker conversation and also from sort of the alarm bells that were coming from Ambassador [William] Taylor and his team that there were Ukrainians who knew about this,\" Cooper said.\n\nCooper said Volker relayed to her a discussion with a top aide to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky about the Ukrainian leader making a statement alluding to \"election interference\" that Ukraine had committed in the past \u2014 a nod to Trump's demand for such an investigation.\n\nCooper told investigators she met with Volker in August to discuss the hold on military aid. During that conversation, according to Cooper, Volker indicated the Ukrainians would not receive the critical military aid until they made a public statement committing to the investigations Trump sought.\n\n\"The context for the discussion that I had with Ambassador Volker related specifically to the path that he was pursuing to lift the hold would be to get them to make this statement, but the only reason they would do that is because there was, you know, something valuable,\" Cooper told investigators.\n\nCooper believed Volker, too, wanted the aid to be released, and she said Volker mentioned to her \"an effort that he was engaged in to see if there was a statement that the government of Ukraine would make that would somehow disavow any interference in U.S. elections and would commit to the prosecution of any individuals involved in election interference.\"\n\nCooper told investigators that Michael Duffey, a senior official at the Office of Management and Budget who handles national security issues, said during a July 26 meeting that the president ordered the hold because of his \"concerns about corruption.\"\n\nBut Cooper also said an interagency review for corruption concerns had already been completed. During the review, Pentagon officials \"affirmed that we believed sufficient progress has been made,\" Cooper added.\n\nould benefit Russia."

        "text": "Republicans name 9 witnesses they want to appear during public impeachment hearings\nGOP lawmakers call for Ukraine whistleblower, Hunter Biden to appear; chief White House correspondent John Roberts reports from the North Lawn.\n\n\n\nDeputy Assistant Secretary of Defense Laura Cooper testified last month that the Trump administration had pushed Ukraine to issue a public statement disavowing any efforts to influence U.S. elections ?but Cooper stopped short of saying that officials wanted to include a reference to Joe and Hunter Biden's business dealings in the country, according to a transcript of her closed-door Oct. 23 deposition released Monday by House Democrats as part of their impeachment inquiry.\n\nPrevious testimony in the impeachment inquiry has suggested that the White House had improperly pressured Ukraine to publicly implicate the Bidens. Former U.S. envoy to Ukraine Kurt Volker, for example, had remarked that European Union envoy Gordon Sondland and Trump attorney Rudy Giuliani worked with a top Ukrainian aide to include a reference to the Biden-linked Ukrainian natural gas company Burisma Holdings.\n\nBut, Cooper said that on Aug. 20, Volker met with her ?and the idea of mentioning the Bidens apparently didn't come up.\n\n\"So in that meeting he did mention something to me that, you know, was the first about somehow an effort that he was engaged in to see if there was a statement that the government of Ukraine would make that would somehow disavow any interference in U.S. elections and would commit to the prosecution of any individuals involved in election interference,\" Cooper said. \"And that was about as specific as it got.\"\n\nCooper's testimony was made public as House Democrats on Monday also released transcripts from their interviews with Christopher Anderson, a career foreign service officer at the State Department, and Catherine Croft, a Ukraine expert at the State Department. Croft testified that she speculated Trump would be willing to shift Ukraine policy to hurt a Biden candidacy, and that news of a holdup of Ukraine aid \"blew up\" a State Department meeting.\n\nCroft, in her remarks, said that the Office of Management and Budget had \u896feported that the White House chief of staff, Mick Mulvaney, had placed an informal hold on security assistance to Ukraine. The only reason given was that it came at the direction of the President.?\nSeparately, Cooper testified about Defense Department concerns that Trump's temporary withholding of military aid to Ukraine may have been illegal.\n\n\n\nDeputy Assistant Secretary of Defense Laura Cooper, left, arrives to review her testimony as part of the House impeachment inquiry into President Donald Trump, Wednesday, Oct. 30, 2019, on Capitol Hill in Washington. (AP Photo/Patrick Semansky)\n\n\"I'm not an expert on the law, but in that meeting immediately deputies began to raise concerns about how this could be done in a legal fashion because there was broad understanding in the meeting that the funding ?the State Department funding related to an earmark for Ukraine and that the DOD funding was specific to Ukraine security assistance,\" Cooper testified, concerning a July 23 meeting of national security officials. \"So the comments in the room at the deputies' level reflected a sense that there was not an understanding of how this could legally play out. And at that meeting the deputies agreed to look into the legalities and to look at what was possible.\"\n\nThe legalities likely regarded the issue of \u8965mpoundment??the requirement that the president either has to spend the money, or \u8965mpound?it.  The White House was coming up against an impoundment deadline when it released the funds for Ukraine.\n\nMoreover, Cooper said, Defense Department officials were concerned that Trump's decision would weaken a \"strategic partner.\"\n\n\"I mean, so DOD was concerned about the obligation of funds,\" she said. \"Policy, my team, we were also concerned about any signal that we would send to Ukraine about a wavering in our commitment.  ?They are trying to negotiate a peace with Russia, and if they are seen as weak, and if they are seen to lack the backing of the United States for their Armed Forces, it makes it much more difficult for them to negotiate a peace on terms that are good for Ukraine.\"\n\nShe added: \"My sense is that all of the senior leaders of the U.S. national security departments and agencies were all unified in their ?in their view that this assistance was essential. And they were trying to find ways to engage the President on this.\"\n\nCroft, meanwhile, told House investigator, \"if this were public in Ukraine it would be seen as a reversal of our policy and would, just to say sort of candidly and colloquially, this would be a really big deal, it would be a really big deal in Ukraine, and an expression of declining U.S. support for Ukraine.\"\n\nUkraine had satisfied all necessary benchmarks to obtain Ukraine Security Assistance Initiative funding, Cooper confirmed. In May, Cooper said, Under Secretary of Defense for Policy John Rood \"provided the certification to Congress, but that was after coordination with the State Department.\"\n\n\n\nCooper also told investigators that she could make a \"very strong inference\" that Ukraine was aware in August that the Trump administration was holding up the financial assistance, shortly before the aid was released in September. Politico reported that the Ukraine aid was temporarily suspended August ?two weeks before it was released.\n\n\"It could have been my inference, yes, a very strong inference that there was some knowledge on the part of the Ukrainians,\" Cooper testified. She called the aid suspension, which came without an explanation to her knowledge, \"unusual.\"\n\nMilitary aid to Ukraine, Cooper further testified, was relevant to U.S. national security interests.\n\n\"Ukraine, and also Georgia, are the two front-line states facing Russian aggression,\" Cooper said. \"In order to deter further Russian aggression, we need to be able to shore up these countries?abilities to defend themselves.  That\u8ab7, I think, pure and simple, the rationale behind our strategy of supporting these countries.  It\u8ab7 in our interest to deter Russian aggression elsewhere around the world.\"\n\nTrump's suggested in his July call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky that the country investigate Joe and Hunter Biden's business dealings there, after it emerged that Joe Biden had pressured Ukraine to fire its top prosecutor while Hunter Biden held a lucrative role on the board of a Ukrainian natural gas company. Zelensky has said he felt no improper pressure during the call.\n\nIn a statement, top House Democrats leading the impeachment inquiry noted that Cooper's testimony indicated that Trump's Ukraine policy angered some officials in the administration.\n\n\u893ceputy Assistant Secretary of Defense Laura Cooper testified that President Trump, through the Office of Management and Budget, directed the freeze on hundreds of millions of dollars of critical military aid for Ukraine, against the judgment of career officials in the Department of Defense, Department of State, and other relevant agencies,\" read the statement, issued by House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Eliot Engel, and Oversight Committee Acting Chair Carolyn Maloney.\n\n\"Cooper also told the Committees that she raised concerns, as did others on several occasions, to senior U.S. government officials about the legality of withholding the congressionally-authorized money, and the challenges that White House delays would put on spending it,\" the Democrats continued.\n\nFox News' Mike Emanuel, Jared Halpern, Bill Mears, Sally Persons and The Associated Press contributed to this report."

Ron Johnson dismissed the House impeachment hearings as \"a very sad farce\" in an interview with the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel. \n\nHe also disputed the idea that an \"irregular channel\" had been established when it came to relations between the United States and Ukraine, saying he doesn't believe \"there's anything wrong in having presidents use people outside the normal diplomatic channels.\"\n\nThe Wisconsin Republican, who has become a key figure in the impeachment inquiry of President Donald Trump, came up again Wednesday during the opening day of the hearings.\n\nAmbassador William Taylor mentioned Johnson in his opening statement when he spoke of the start of an \"irregular channel\" between the United States and Ukraine.\n\n\nJohnson was part of the U.S. delegation that attended the May 20 inauguration of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. Others included former Ambassador Kurt Volker, who was a special envoy to Ukraine; European Union Ambassador Gordon Sondland; and U.S. Secretary of Energy Rick Perry.\n\n\"The irregular channel began when Ambassador Volker, Ambassador Sondland, Secretary Perry, and Senator Ron Johnson briefed President Trump on May 23 upon their return from President Zelensky\u8ab7 inauguration,\" Tayor said in his opening statement.\n\n\"The delegation was as enthusiastic as I would soon become about the new Ukrainian president and urged President Trump to meet with him early on to cement the U.S.-Ukraine relationship. But from what I understood from the participants, President Trump did not share their enthusiasm for a meeting with President Zelensky,\" Taylor testified.\n\nJohnson is chairman of the Europe subcommittee on Senate Foreign Relations Committee, chairman of the Senate Homeland Security Committee and a member of the Senate's bipartisan Ukraine Caucus.\n\nVolker, the U.S. envoy for Ukraine, reportedly briefed the delegation on reports that Trump's personal attorney, Rudy Giuliani, was trying to get Ukraine to conduct investigations that would help Trump politically.\n\nTaylor has also said that when Johnson and Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn., met with Zelensky in Ukraine on Sept. 5, Zelensky's first question was about the held-up security funds.\n\nOn the impeachment hearings, Johnson said he watched for about an hour \"over the noon hour.\"\n\n\"I don't think they really plowed any new ground,\" he said.\n\nAsked about the \"irregular channel,\" Johnson said he didn't share those concerns.\n\n\"I personally don't believe there's anything wrong in having presidents use people outside the normal diplomatic channels to be engaged in diplomacy,\" Johnson said in an interview Wednesday. \"It's happened throughout history.\"\n\nTaylor has said he grew alarmed by August because the irregular, politically connected channel for foreign policy developed different objectives than the normal foreign policy channel maintained by the State Department.\n\nJohnson said he fears that some in the State Department and National Security Council \"don't really buy into the president's legitimacy.\"\n\n\"You don't back channel, you don't try and undermine the president's foreign policy, and I think that's kind of what's happening here,\" Johnson said.\n\nTrump held up nearly $400 million in U.S. aid to Ukraine in July and weeks later, on July 25, asked Zelensky to do him a \"favor\" and investigate the 2016 election and Joe Biden, the former vice president now seeking the Democratic presidential nomination. Biden's son Hunter served on the board of a Ukrainian gas company. \n\nTrump's call with Zelensky triggered a whistleblower's complaint that led to the impeachment inquiry. \n\nJohnson \"winced\" at the possibility of such a connection and spoke to Trump the next day. In their Aug. 31 phone call, Johnson asked Trump whether Ukraine needed to do anything to get its aid and Trump angrily insisted there was no quid pro quo, according to Johnson. Johnson took him at his word.\n\nJohnson during that call asked Trump to give him the authority to tell Zelensky the aid would be provided to Ukraine, but Trump wouldn\u8ab8 give him that power. Trump told Johnson he would probably like the decision Trump would ultimately make on releasing the aid to Ukraine, according to Johnson.\n\n\"What's happened is this has been blown way out of proportion,\" he said. \"We've turned this into an impeachment inquiry, when truthfully this should have just been done kind of quietly within the administration.\"\n\nDespite his close involvement in Ukraine issues, Johnson has said he would not recuse himself from a Senate impeachment trial of Trump.\n\nJohnson on Wednesday again defended Trump and his handling of foreign policy and aid to Ukraine.\n\n\"I don't know what the House is trying to do here,\" Johnson said. \"In the end, I think this is, unfortunately, a very sad farce on the part of the House.\""

The apology will remind voters to update their address if it has changed.\n\nAntonacci said he will have elections workers personally look at the voter files before the status of any voter is switched.\n\nShortly after Antonacci spoke with the South Florida Sun Sentinel, Broward County's Congressional delegation announced it was sending a letter to Antonacci asking him to find and fix the causes of the errors and assure affected voters that their voting status is not in jeopardy.\n\nThe letter from the four Democrats representing Broward in the U.S. House of Representatives said the situation has caused \"confusion\" and risks \"the full and equal participation\" of county voters in future elections.\n\n\"Without clarification, voters who received the erroneous notifications from your office will be under the assumption that their voter registration is at risk,\" said the letter, signed by Reps. Ted Deutch, Alcee Hastings, Debbie Wasserman Schultz and Frederica Wilson.\n\n\"We're doing all that,\" said Antonacci, who had yet to receive the delegation's letter.\n\nThe delegation was responding to an earlier Sun Sentinel report that a number of voters who received the final notice saw no reason for their address to be questioned.\n\nTwo contacted by the Sun Sentinel were Democrats questioning if it might have been an attempt at voter suppression, given that Antonacci was appointed by former Gov. Rick Scott, a Republican, to replace Brenda Snipes, a Democrat who resigned following vote-counting problems in last year's November elections.\n\nThe Broward elections office used the wrong ZIP code on a mailer sent to Ken Evans, even though his correct ZIP code is on file with the office.\nThe Broward elections office used the wrong ZIP code on a mailer sent to Ken Evans, even though his correct ZIP code is on file with the office.\nKen Evans, of Lauderdale-by-the-Sea, and Ray Stepnowski, of Deerfield Beach, have lived in their homes for more than 20 years and have voted in every election for more than a decade, but each got the notices from the elections office questioning their addresses.\n\nThe elections office said the errors had to do with the office's bulk-mailing process and wasn't political. The company it uses, Commercial Printers in Fort Lauderdale, has been handling its mailings for years and also prints the county's ballots, officials said.\n\nInitially, the elections office sent out a non-forwardable information mailer in September through bulk mail to the county's 1.2 million voters, with 146,000 coming back as undeliverable, officials said. Of those voters, 54,000 then received the final notice mailer.\n\nThe elections office said a return rate of between 10% and 15% is typical, and the county's return number, though large, comes to about 12% of the total mailing.\n\n\"That 12 percent represents a real fluid society. People move around a lot,\" Antonacci said.\n\nAntonacci said he's more concerned that the follow-up notice was not the mail that should have been sent out. Instead of a final notice, those voters should have received a much less threatening \"address request for information\" postcard, he said. Only if no response to that request is received should a final notice be sent out, he said.\n\nHowever, even if a voter is designated inactive, they are still eligible to vote and it's easy to change their status back to active, Antonacci said. They can either contact the elections office, send back an address confirmation, vote in an upcoming election \u2014 either by mail, at an early voting site or at their regular polling precinct \u2014 or request a mail-in ballot.\n\nIt's only if a voter is designated inactive and doesn't vote through the next two upcoming general elections that they become ineligible to vote and must provide additional information to restore their eligibility.\n\nClarification: This article has been updated to show the correct number of people who were mailed \"final notices\" by the Broward elections office. Supervisor of Elections Pete Antonacci on Friday followed up earlier information he had provided by saying that of the 146,000 items returned undeliverable from the September mailing, only 54,000 were sent final notices."

        "title": "Trump DC hotel sales pitch boasts of millions to be made from foreign governments",
        "text": "In its effort to sell off the lease to the Trump International Hotel in Washington, the Trump Organization has put together a glossy investor brochure complete with pictures showcasing the hotel's grandiose architecture, its central location and its spa's Himalayan salt chamber.\n\nThe hotel's biggest selling point though, according to a copy of the brochure seen by CNN, is the one thing that the Trump family insists it didn't take advantage of: profiting off foreign governments.\n\n\"Tremendous upside potential exists for a new owner to fully capitalize on government related business upon rebranding of the asset,\" reads the 46-page investor pitch.\n\nThe Trump Organization insists that its refusal to solicit foreign business has cost it more than $9 million. According to the brochure, those \"sacrifices\" include turning away 17,100 room nights in 2019, resulting in $5.3 million in lost room revenue and $3.9 million in lost food and beverage revenue.\n\nThe investor pitch is an explicit acknowledgment of how important foreign business is to the 263-room luxury hotel in the Old Post Office building blocks from the White House.\n\nThough it includes specific numbers of how much money it turned away from foreign governments, the pitch does not include figures for how much the hotel has accepted, despite reports showing it has become a magnet for foreign officials. Nor does it provide actual or historical financial performance data for the hotel, which is named in multiple lawsuits accusing Trump of using the property to illegally profit off his presidency.\n\nThose lawsuits claim Trump has violated the emoluments clause of the US Constitution, which forbids the President from receiving gifts or payments from foreign governments. In its defense, the Trump Organization says that it has voluntarily donated over $340,000 in income it has received from foreign governments to the US Treasury in 2017 and 2018. The President's lawyers have also argued that since his assets have been placed into a trust, he does not directly benefit from the hotel's business.\n\nInstead the materials offer financial projections for years 2020 to 2026 based on a sales and marketing strategy targeting foreign governments.\n\nTrump previously reported in his financial disclosure form that the hotel made $40.8 million in revenues in 2018 and $40.4 million in 2017. The family has never disclosed whether the hotel is profitable.\n\nThe Trump Organization did not respond to CNN's requests for comment.\n\nProjected jump in revenue\nNevertheless the company is projecting a whopping 65% jump in revenue from 2018 to 2020. According to the investor pitch, the hotel is estimated to have operating revenues of $67.7 million next year, and $6 million in earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization minus expenses to keep the hotel updated.\n\nJLL Hotels & Hospitality, the real estate company hired to sell the hotel lease, projects the occupancy rate at the Washington hotel next year will hit 68.3%. That's below other five-star hotels in the area, which JLL estimates will have 74.5% occupancy rates, according to the investor brief.\n\nTrump International Hotel DC\nExclusive: Data show Trump's DC hotel was pricier and emptier than peers in 2017\nThe investor pitch began circulating in recent weeks after the Trump Organization announced last month that it was exploring the sale of its 60-year lease with the General Services Administration. After signing the lease in 2013, the Trump Organization poured millions of dollars into revamping the Old Post Office building, and opened its doors in October 2016, less than two weeks before Trump won the election.\n\n\"People are objecting to us making so much money on the hotel, and therefore we may be willing to sell,\" Eric Trump said in a statement last month. When Trump became President he did not sell off his assets as previous presidents have, but put the family business into a trust delegating the running of the family business to his two sons, Eric and Don Jr, and other executives.\n\n$500 million selling price\nA person familiar with the matter told the Wall Street Journal that the company is hoping to get more than $500 million for the property, or about $2 million per room key (the sales price divided by the number of rooms) \u2013 which would be one of the highest prices ever paid for a hotel in Washington.\n\nBy contrast the Rosewood Hotel, a luxury five-star property in Georgetown, sold for $1.3 million a room key in 2016.\n\n\"It's an extremely high price but the location and the recent renovation of the hotel are going to command a historic value for the Washington, DC, area,\" said Dan Hawkins, a senior director in hotels and hospitality group of Berkadia, a commercial real estate firm.\n\nA sale is not without complications. The buyer won't own the land since it's leased from GSA, which would also have to approve the sale. The arrangement also raises possible conflicts of interest since Trump is effectively on both sides of the transaction as the seller and the boss of the GSA officials charged with approving a deal.\n\nSome potential buyers have questioned why Trump wouldn't wait until he leaves office to sell the property to avoid debate over whether he sought to benefit from his office. Others have raised ethical concerns that it is overpriced and being marketed to deep pocketed foreign buyers, who may be motivated to curry favor with the President.\n\nWhen Trump created the trust for his business he also named as ethics adviser Bobby Burchfield, a Washington lawyer, who would have to approve certain transactions, including a sale of the hotel. Under the ethics review, Trump is not permitted to sell to a sovereign wealth fund or to a foreign government. A foreign citizen however would not be immediately disqualified from buying the hotel.\n\nThe transaction also has to be determined to be a fair market value with no indication that the counterpart is trying to influence the Trump administration or extract a concession.\n\nDespite the Trump Organization's claims that it turned away millions of dollars in business from foreign governments, the Washington hotel has done brisk business with them. Delegations from Saudi Arabia, Malaysia and Kuwait have stayed at the hotel or held events there, along with members of Trump's cabinet and GOP fundraisers. The Prime Minister of Romania reportedly booked a room earlier this year.\n\nForeign business is not the only selling point the Trump Organization is highlighting to possible buyers. They're also anticipating a boost to the hotel market from one company the president loves to hate, Amazon, whose CEO Jeff Bezos also owns the Washington Post.\n\nOne full page in the 46-page package promotes the benefits that may come from Amazon's decision to build its second headquarters in northern Virginia. JLL projects that Amazon could add 880,000 room nights in seven years, \"further driving compression,\" or full occupancy, \"to the lodging sector in Washington DC.\""

        "text": "Pete Buttigieg, the mayor of South Bend, Indiana, and 2020 presidential candidate, sought to clarify his views on the administration of former President Barack Obama Monday after facing criticism for a since-corrected report in which he appeared to refer to the \"failures\" of that administration.\n\nOn Twitter, Buttigieg said that his \"appreciation of the great leadership of Barack Obama comes from a very personal place.\"\n\nThe original article, published by the Los Angeles Times over the weekend, included a Buttigieg quote that seemed to blame Obama for the election of President Donald Trump.\n\nIt was corrected on Monday with the accurate quote: \"I think the failures of the old normal help explain how we got Trump.\"\n\nOn Twitter, the reporter who wrote the article said the mistake happened because the comment by Buttigieg happened with a noisy background, causing the reporter to mishear the recording while transcribing at a rally.\n\n\"I deeply regret the mistake When we make errors we own them. This one really hurts because it went viral,\" journalist Evan Halper said.\n\nButtigieg said he appreciates the reporter's \"swift and honest correction.\"\n\nIn an interview with NBC News on Monday, Buttigieg expanded on his reaction to the correction and praised Obama further.\n\n\"The reality is, despite what this president says, journalists take their obligation very seriously to make sure everything they print is accurate, and you saw that in how quickly that correction took place,\" Buttigieg said.\n\n\"The achievements of the Obama administration affected me personally in many ways, including the ability to serve openly, and I'm an admirer of President Obama,\" he added. Buttigieg, a veteran, came out as gay in 2015. The military's official \"don't ask, don't tell\" policy on gay people serving in the armed forces was ended by Obama.\n\nThe misquote was shared widely on social media and was picked up by multiple media outlets because of its newsworthiness; most 2020 Democratic candidates have taken to praising Obama.\n\nThough some 2020 hopefuls appeared to criticize the former president during primary debates for his signature health care policy, the Affordable Care Act, and on immigration, they have been sure to express appreciation for Obama's legacy.\n\nQ and A:Democratic presidential candidate Pete Buttigieg shares his views on current issues\n\nFormer Vice President Joe Biden has been a staunch defender of the Obama-Biden administration, even under criticism, though he has sought to avoid taking the blame for some of the more criticized actions at times.\n\n\u8953ou can't have it both ways,?New Jersey Sen.

You can\u8ab8 do it when it's convenient and dodge it when it's not.\"\n\nPrimary debate:'#ThanksObama': 2020 Democrats walk back Obama criticisms\n\nButtigieg's campaign has drawn some comparisons to Obama's on the trail by voters. He told the Des Moines Register that those comparisons are \"flattering.\"\n\n\"I think there's some overlap, certainly, between the style that he brought, and what I'm trying to offer,\" said Buttigieg, who campaigned for Obama in Iowa in 2007.\n\nOn the stump:Pete Buttigieg says he offers style and message parallels with Barack Obama's Iowa campaign\n\nThe LA Times' misquote of Buttigieg resulted in criticisms from those who saw it as alienating to a Democratic base that still largely supports the Obama administration. (Obama is rated as the best president by Americans during their lifetimes, according to a 2018 report from Pew Research Center.)\n\nFormer Obama Cabinet secretary and 2020 candidate Juli\u5649 Castro also initially called out Buttigieg on Twitter but deleted that tweet after the correction. \"I regret that the original (quote) was spread widely,\" Castro said. \n\nIn a recent USA TODAY/Suffolk University poll, Buttigieg held his own against front runners Biden, Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders. He also surged in a poll conducted among Iowa caucusgoers last month, putting him in reach of Biden and Warren. And a recent Quinnipiac poll put him only behind Warren in a virtual four-way tie in that state.\n\nContributing: Rebecca Morin, Aamer Madhani, USA TODAY and Barbara Rodriguez, Des Moines Register"

        "text": "Former Vice President Joe Biden's campaign is hoping to capitalize on his lengthy history on the world stage as his team launches a new television ad in the battleground state of Iowa and as his position in several national polls tightens.\n\nThe ad seeks to draw a contrast between President Donald Trump's handling of foreign affairs versus what the campaign touts as Biden's wealth of experience in the foreign policy realm honed by his over 30 years in the United States Senate and eight years as vice president.\n\nBiden's team is launching a new television ad in Iowa, the first that will focus on Biden's wealth of experience in the foreign policy realm, honed by his over 30 years in the United States Senate and eight years as vice president.\n\n\"We live in the most dangerous moment in a generation. Our world, set on edge by an erratic, unstable president. Dictators and tyrants are praised, our allies, pushed aside,\" the ad entitled \"Moment\" begins over black and white still images, including photos of President Trump, Vladimir Putin, and Kim Jong Un.\"\n\n\"This is a moment that requires strong, steady, stable leadership. We need someone tested, and trusted around the world. This is a moment for Joe Biden -- a president with the experience to lead,\" the ad continues, transitioning to color photos highlighting Biden's time in public office.\n\nThe 30-second broadcast version of the ad, which is set to begin airing in Iowa on Tuesday, and the 15-second digital version are part of a previously announced $4 million media buy in Iowa.\n\nThe ad airs ahead of the first public hearing in the impeachment inquiry of President Trump--proceedings which stem from his July phone conversation with the president of Ukraine, Voldymyr Zelenskiy, who he may have urged to launch an investigation into Joe Biden and his son, Hunter Biden.\n\nThe ad also airs ahead of next week's Democratic debates and as national polling shows the race narrowing between Biden and his closest competitors: Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders and South Bend, Ind. Mayor Pete Buttigieg.\n\nIn Iowa, a recent Quinnipiac poll showed essentially a four-way tie at the top of the pack between Biden, Warren, Sanders and Buttigieg among likely caucus-goers.\n\nA Monmouth University poll out this week had Buttigieg topping the field, yet still within the margin of error, at 22%, among likely Democratic caucus-goers. Biden is close behind with 19%, Warren is at 18% and Sanders rounds out the top four with 13%.\n\nIn this poll, only 28% of likely Democratic caucus-goers said they are firmly decided on their pick for the nominee. Most are open to the possibility of supporting a different candidate - with 16% saying there is a high possibility that they could change their minds and 37% saying there is a moderate possibility.\n\nBiden's campaign is hoping to capitalize on that and make deeper inroads in the Hawkeye state.\n\nThe ad launch comes on the heels of Biden's second trip to Iowas in two weeks' time, and the day after the campaign launch of two new policy proposals focused on veterans and military families.\n\nThe messaging in the ad mirrors a similar sentiment Biden has shared on the trail, including during a Veterans Day town hall in Oskaloosa, Iowa, on Monday.\n\n\"Right now, we don't really have a foreign policy. I'm not being facetious -- we don't have a foreign policy. We are embracing thugs like Putin and Kim Jong-un. This president's talking about love letters with a butcher. This guy had his uncle's brains blown out sitting across the table, his brother assassinated in an airport. This is a guy who has virtually no social redeeming value,\" Biden said, referring to Kim.\n\nAn advisor to the Biden campaign tells ABC News they believe Biden has set himself apart within the Democratic Party with his foreign policy credentials, particularly after the October Democratic primary debate, and indicated they plan to lean into the messaging on Biden's resume this week as the impeachment inquiry is center stage.\n\nFollowing the release of the ad, the campaign rolled out 133 endorsements for Biden from former national security officials who have served across seven different administrations.\n\nMany of those who endorsed Biden have had ties to former vice president for several years, and served as senior national security officials in the Obama-Biden administration, including former national security adviser Tom Donilon, former undersecretary of state Nick Burns, former deputy CIA director Avril Haines, former homeland security and counterterrorism adviser Lisa Monaco and Biden's former national security advisers Jake Sullivan and Colin Kahl.\n\nAs part of the new ad buy, the campaign is also planning to amplify Biden's rope line interactions with Iowa voters as a way to showcase his ability to make personal, and often times emotional, connections on the trail, a key to winning support in the critical first primary contest. The campaign plans to push these moments out on Facebook, Instagram and YouTube in the coming days.\n\nOn the trail in Iowa, Biden has begun hosting more town hall-style events that allow for audience interaction and has stepped up his messaging on experience, arguing that he is better prepared than the rest of the Democratic field to take the reins of America's massive foreign policy apparatus.\n\n\"The next president is going to inherit a divided nation and a world in disarray. That's just a fact. It's going to require someone who can truly unite this nation at home and someone who can command the respect of world leaders on day one,\" Biden said at a town hall in Maquoketa, Iowa, in late October.\n\n\"There's not gonna be a whole lot of time for on the job training. Day One you gotta be able to stand up and the world know you know what you're talking about. Know you know what you're saying. And know you mean what you say. We have to set aside our divisions and come together as Americans.\" Biden argued at the same event.\n\nThe ad launch comes on the heels of Biden's second trip to the Hawkeye state in two week's time, and the day after the campaign launch of two new policy proposals focused on veterans and military families."

        "text": "Mick Mulvaney, the president's acting chief of staff, and John R. Bolton, his former national security adviser, clashed in court even as more accounts of internal schisms emerged in books and testimony.\n\nPresident Trump's chief of staff and former national security adviser clashed in court on Monday. Two new books describe how top aides to the president secretly plotted to circumvent him. And nearly every day brings more testimony about the deep internal schism over the president's effort to pressure Ukraine for domestic political help.\n\nUpdate\n\nMulvaney will defy House impeachment subpoena.\n\nIn the three years since his election, Mr. Trump has never been accused of running a cohesive, unified team. But the revelations of recent days have put on display perhaps more starkly than ever the fissures tearing at his administration. In the emerging picture, the Trump White House is a toxic stew of personality disputes, policy differences, political rivalries, ethical debates and a fundamental rift over the president himself.\n\nThe fault lines were most clearly evident on Monday when Mick Mulvaney, the acting White House chief of staff, abruptly withdrew his effort to join a lawsuit over impeachment testimony after a sharp collision with his onetime colleague John R. Bolton, the former national security adviser. Mr. Mulvaney retreated only hours after a lawyer for Mr. Bolton and his former deputy, Charles M. Kupperman, went to court arguing that his clients wanted nothing to do with the staff chief because they had vastly different interests.\n\nIn withdrawing his motion, Mr. Mulvaney indicated that he would now press his own lawsuit to determine whether to comply with a subpoena to testify in the House impeachment inquiry. But it left him at odds with the president, who has ordered his team not to cooperate with the House, an order Mr. Mulvaney has essentially refused to accept as other administration officials have until he receives separate guidance from a judge.\n\nMr. Mulvaney's lawyers emphasized that he was not trying to oppose Mr. Trump, maintaining that he was actually trying to sue House Democrats, and an administration official who insisted on anonymity said there was \"no distance\" between the president and his chief of staff. Still, Mr. Mulvaney hired his own lawyer instead of relying on the White House counsel, and he consciously made clear that he was open to testifying if left to his own devices.\n\nThanks for reading The Times.\nSubscribe to The Times\nThe situation underscored the longstanding enmity between Mr. Mulvaney and the counsel, Pat A. Cipollone, who have repeatedly been at odds throughout the impeachment inquiry, according to four administration officials briefed on the events.\n\nMr. Mulvaney, who has been left with an \"acting\" title for more than 10 months and therefore insecure in his position, is said to see Mr. Cipollone as angling for his job as chief of staff. People close to Mr. Cipollone deny that and say he is not interested, although they acknowledged that there were previous discussions with Mr. Trump about such a shift.\n\nHoping to bolster his own place in the White House, Mr. Mulvaney has recommended to Mr. Trump that he hire Mark Paoletta, the general counsel at the Office of Management and Budget, where Mr. Mulvaney is still technically the director, according to people familiar with the maneuvering. Mr. Paoletta would not displace Mr. Cipollone but would give Mr. Mulvaney an ally on the legal team as the impeachment battle plays out.\n\nAnother person familiar with the latest moves said that Mr. Paoletta was considered, but that West Wing officials decided they were pleased with the hiring of Pam Bondi, a former attorney general of Florida, and Tony Sayegh, a Republican strategist, both of whom began full time this week.\n\nThe latest personnel struggle echoed an attempt by Mr. Mulvaney several weeks ago to hire former Representative Trey Gowdy, a fellow South Carolina Republican, to join the president's legal team. Mr. Cipollone and others were said to take issue with the idea, concerned it was an effort by Mr. Mulvaney to run his own legal team. Mr. Cipollone told allies he had no such concerns, but eventually, Mr. Gowdy bowed out, facing an issue with a ban on former House members lobbying Congress.\n\nDespite his own tenuous job status, Mr. Mulvaney has privately told associates in recent days that there is no easy way for Mr. Trump to fire him in the midst of the impeachment fight, the implication being that he knows too much about the president's pressure campaign to force Ukraine to provide incriminating information about Democrats.\n\nThe court fight between Mr. Mulvaney and Mr. Bolton on Monday brought their long-running feud into the open. Mr. Mulvaney was among those facilitating the Ukraine effort, while Mr. Bolton was among those objecting to it. At one point, according to testimony in the impeachment inquiry, Mr. Bolton declared that he wanted no part of the \"drug deal\" Mr. Mulvaney was cooking up, as the then national security adviser characterized the pressure campaign.\n\nTheir clash was just one of many inside Mr. Trump's circle spilling out into public in recent days. The legal conflict on Monday came just a day before Nikki R. Haley, the president's former ambassador to the United Nations, plans to publish a memoir accusing Mr. Trump's former secretary of state, Rex W. Tillerson, and former chief of staff, John F. Kelly, of conspiring behind his back while in office. Her account in effect is a mirror image of another book coming out this month by an anonymous senior administration official describing how concerned aides mounted their own internal resistance to Mr. Trump.\n\nMr. Kelly disputed Ms. Haley in a statement on Sunday and Mr. Tillerson added his own refutation on Monday. \"During my service to our country as the secretary of state, at no time did I, nor to my direct knowledge did anyone else serving along with me, take any actions to undermine the president,\" Mr. Tillerson said in a statement.\n\nWhile he offered Mr. Trump frank advice, he said, once the president made a decision, he did his best to carry it out. \"Ambassador Haley was rarely a participant in my many meetings and is not in a position to know what I may or may not have said to the president,\" Mr. Tillerson added.\n\nMr. Tillerson was never enamored of Ms. Haley when they were both in office, seeing her as a rival trying to upstage him and run foreign policy from her perch at the United Nations. Ms. Haley's portrayal of herself fighting off Mr. Trump's internal enemies was met on Monday with scoffs from several administration officials, who said they were aware of little evidence to back up her self-description. But a former senior administration official who witnessed some of the interactions Ms. Haley had with the president described her as heavily involved with policy.\n\nThe books are being published at the same time new transcripts are released by the House documenting how Mr. Trump's personal lawyer, Rudolph W. Giuliani, and a coterie of allies, including Mr. Mulvaney, sought to sideline career diplomats and other foreign policy officials who warned against enlisting Ukraine to help the president's personal political interests.\n\nThe dispute pitted one part of Mr. Trump's administration against another in a struggle over foreign policy that now has the president on the precipice of being impeached for high crimes and misdemeanors.\n\nThe lawsuit that Mr. Mulvaney sought to join was filed by Mr. Kupperman, a longtime associate of Mr. Bolton's, asking a court to decide whether Mr. Kupperman should obey the president's dictate to stay silent or a House subpoena to testify.\n\nWhile not technically a party to the lawsuit, Mr. Bolton, who left his post in September after clashing with Mr. Trump, is represented by the same lawyer, Charles J. Cooper, and is taking the same position as Mr. Kupperman in waiting for the court to decide whether he should testify or not.\n\nMr. Mulvaney's effort to join the lawsuit late Friday night stunned many involved in the impeachment debate because he still works for the president. Mr. Mulvaney did not ask Mr. Bolton or Mr. Kupperman for permission to join the lawsuit, nor did he give them a heads up. Mr. Bolton and his team considered it an outrageous move because they were on opposite sides of the Ukraine fight and did not want their lawsuit polluted with Mr. Mulvaney.\n\nNot only did the motion filed Monday by Mr. Bolton's camp seek to keep Mr. Mulvaney out of the lawsuit, it even advanced an argument that the acting chief of staff may have to testify before House impeachment investigators. The motion noted that in a briefing with reporters last month, Mr. Mulvaney appeared \"to admit that there was a quid pro quo\" before later trying to take back the admission, meaning that he might not have the right to defy a House subpoena since he had already discussed the matter in public.\n\n\"Accordingly, there is a serious question as to whether Mulvaney waived the absolute testimonial immunity claimed by the president,\" the motion said.\n\nMr. Mulvaney's lawyers rejected that. \"The idea that Mr. Mulvaney has somehow waived broad immunity by speaking about this\" at a briefing \"doesn't have any legs,\" Christopher C. Muha, one of the lawyers, told the judge in the case on Monday afternoon, according to a transcript of a conference call released by the court.\n\nNonetheless, Judge Richard J. Leon, of the United States District for the District of Columbia, indicated at the end of the call that he was inclined to reject Mr. Mulvaney's request to join the suit. Mr. Mulvaney then withdrew it and said he would file his own separate action.\n\nThe motion filed by Mr. Bolton's camp noted that Mr. Kupperman does not take a position on who is right, the president or Congress, and \"will remain neutral on the merits of the constitutional issue,\" while Mr. Mulvaney \"has made it clear that he supports the executive\" branch interpretation.\n\nPeter Baker reported from Washington, and Maggie Haberman from New York. Michael S. Schmidt contributed reporting from Washington."

        "title": "Democrats release three new transcripts as part of impeachment inquiry",
        "text": "House Democrats released three new transcripts from closed-door depositions Monday as they charge toward the open hearing phase of their impeachment inquiry later this week.\n\nThe release included the transcript of Laura Cooper, a top Defense Department official who oversees Ukraine. She testified about the Trump administration's decision to withhold nearly $400 million in aid, which Democrats are examining as part of their investigation into whether President Trump pressed Ukraine to help his own reelection bid in 2020.\n\nDemocrats also released the transcripts from joint depositions with Catherine Croft and Christopher Anderson, two former assistants to former U.S. special envoy to Ukraine Kurt Volker.\n\nWhile all three are relatively minor witnesses, they offered information for House investigators who are trying to determine whether Trump used the aid or the promise of a White House meeting as leverage to get Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to open probes into interference in the 2016 presidential election and former Vice President Joe Biden, one of his top 2020 political rivals.\n\nDemocrats subpoenaed Cooper, deputy assistant secretary of Defense for Russia, Ukraine and Eurasia, late last month to press her about any role the Pentagon may have played in withholding aid to Ukraine. \n\nCooper's testimony was primarily memorable for a GOP protest that delayed it.\n\nA group of congressional Republicans protesting the closed-door depositions disrupted the scheduled hearing by storming the secure closed space in which the interview was set to be conducted. \n\n{mosads}The protest successfully delayed the hearing by five hours as the roughly 20 GOP members who barged their way into the sensitive compartmented information facility refused to leave, even ordering boxes of pizza during lunchtime. \n\nCooper began her scheduled deposition around 3 p.m., shortly after the House sergeant at arms was seen going alone into the secure room.  \n\nAnderson testified about concerns he and others had regarding Rudy Giuliani's involvement in Ukraine policy. Anderson said officials feared the president's personal lawyer was spreading a negative narrative about Ukraine and possibly create a \"false perception\" in Trump's mind that Kyiv is not an ally, which could risk hurting their relationship.\n\nCroft, a foreign service officer assigned to the White House, testified that Kyiv knew the aid was being withheld earlier than previously reported, saying officials at the Ukrainian Embassy twice approached her privately to inquire about the decision to withhold aid sometime after July 18 and before the August 28, adding that \"they found out very early on or much earlier than I expected them to.\" Both the U.S. and Ukraine, she testified, did not want news that the aid was being withheld because it would create doubt about their alliance.\n\nThe release of these transcripts come on the same week that Democrats are expected to hold their first series of open impeachment hearings, starting Wednesday."

        "text": "For only the fourth time in U.S. history, the House of Representatives has started a presidential impeachment inquiry. House committees are trying to determine whether President Donald Trump violated his oath of office by asking Ukraine to investigate political rival Joe Biden's family and the 2016 U.S. presidential election all while the White House was withholding military aid to the East European ally that borders Russia.\n\nFull Coverage: Trump impeachment inquiry\n\nA quick forecast of what's coming this week:\n\nLIGHTS, CAMERAS, HEARINGS\n\nAmericans will have their first public view of the impeachment inquiry, as the proceedings emerge from the secure closed-door facility in the Capitol basement to live hearings.\n\nHouse Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, D-Calif., will gavel in the sessions Wednesday and Friday.\n\nWhat's unclear, though, is what people will see in two days of hearings . Will the proceedings serve as a clarifying moment for the country, when a common narrative emerges over the president's actions and whether or not they are, in fact, impeachable? Or in this era of peak partisanship, will the days devolve into a reality-TV episode showcasing the divide?\n\nUnlike Watergate in the 1970s or even Bill Clinton's impeachment in the 1990s, Americans consume their news at different times and in different ways, making it hard to know if this week will produce a where-were-you-when moment.\n\n___\n\nSPOTLIGHT ON WITNESSES\n\nBill Taylor . George Kent . Marie \"Masha\" Yovanovitch.\n\nOnce little-known State Department officials are about to become household names as they testify publicly in the impeachment inquiry.\n\nTaylor, a Vietnam War veteran who has spent 50 years in public service, will set the tone as the first witness. All three have testified in the closed setting, defying the White House's instructions not to comply. But they are providing a remarkably consistent account of the Trump administration's actions.\n\nRepublicans want to hear from others , including Biden's son Hunter, as well as the anonymous government whistleblower who sparked the impeachment inquiry, but Democrats who have majority control are not likely to agree to those requests.\n\n___\n\nPERSUADING VOTERS\n\nRepublicans have struggled to articulate a unified defense of Trump. Democrats have had difficulty synthesizing their arguments into a simple narrative for the public.\n\nBoth will be sharpening efforts to persuade American voters.\n\nRep. Jim Himes, D-Conn., said Sunday on NBC's \"Meet the Press\" what the public will hear is \"immensely patriotic, beautiful articulated \u2014 articulate people telling the story of a president who \u2014 let's forget quid pro quo; quid pro quo is one of these things to muddy the works \u2014 who extorted a vulnerable country by holding up military aid.\"\n\nBut Republicans have focused their attacks with a resolution criticizing the House process. Some in the party want to reveal the name of the government whistleblower.\n\nSen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., said on Fox News Channel's \"Sunday Morning Futures,\" \u2033I consider any impeachment in the House that doesn't allow us to know who the whistleblower is to be invalid, because without the whistleblower complaint, we wouldn't be talking about any of this.\"\n\nGraham added that there's a \"need for Hunter Biden to be called to adequately defend the president. And if you don't do those two things, it's a complete joke.\"\n\nJoe Biden scoffed at the idea that his son should testify, saying Monday: \"There is zero rationale for that to happen. This is all a diversion.\"\n\n___\n\nWHAT WILL TRUMP DO?\n\nFor those watching television Wednesday afternoon, the president is offering some counterprogramming to the impeachment inquiry's public hearing: a joint news conference with Turkey's president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, amid strains in relations between the two nations.\n\nOn impeachment, the president tried to give his allies on Capitol Hill some talking points Sunday, tweeting out his advice for how they should defend him \u2014 namely by insisting, as he did, that his call with the Ukrainian president was \"PERFECT.\"\n\n\"Read the Transcript!\" Trump intoned on Twitter. \"There was NOTHING said that was in any way wrong. Republicans, don't be led into the fools trap of saying it was not perfect, but is not impeachable. No, it is much stronger than that. NOTHING WAS DONE WRONG!\"\n\nThe White House released a rough transcript of his July call and Trump also says he will release, probably on Tuesday, an account of an April phone call he had with Ukraine's leader, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, soon after Zelenskiy won election.\n\nTestimony in the closed proceedings shows that the April congratulatory call did not raise concerns, but the tone shifted on the July call that caused alarms among U.S. officials.\n\n___\n\nMORE TRANSCRIPTS, MORE HEARINGS COMING\n\nHouse investigators have been steadily releasing transcripts from hundreds of pages of testimony they received behind closed doors.\n\nMore transcripts are expected. Nearly a dozen people have testified in the inquiry and investigators are building the public record of their findings. But this week's hearings will probably not be the last.\n\nHouse investigators may still call others to testify, most likely Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman, an Army officer assigned to the National Security Council, and Fiona Hill, a former White House adviser on Russia. Both testified behind closed doors of their concerns about the Trump administration's effort to push Ukraine to investigate Democrats.\n\nEventually the Intelligence Committee will send a report of its findings to the Judiciary Committee, which would decide whether to pursue articles of impeachment against the president. A House vote on impeachment could come by Christmas."

        "text": "White House acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney's last-minute effort to join a lawsuit that could determine whether senior administration officials testify in the impeachment inquiry was an unwelcome surprise to former top national security aides, highlighting internal divisions among President Trump's advisers in the face of the probe.\n\nFormer national security adviser John Bolton's advisers and allies were taken aback to learn late Friday that Mulvaney had gone to court seeking to join a separation-of-powers lawsuit filed against Trump and the House leadership, according to people familiar with their views, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the ongoing inquiry.\n\nThe suit was filed by Bolton's former deputy, Charles Kupperman, who is asking a federal judge to determine whether a congressional subpoena takes precedence over a White House order not to comply with the inquiry. Bolton is willing to testify if the judge rules in favor of the House, The Washingon Post previously reported.\n\nThe Fix's Amber Phillips breaks down the major developments from what happened in the impeachment inquiry during the week of Nov. 3. (Video: The Washington Post)\n\nPeople close to Bolton and Kupperman said the two were flabbergasted by Mulvaney's surprise request to join the lawsuit because they and others on the national security team considered Mulvaney a critical player in the effort to get the Ukrainian government to pursue investigations into Trump's political opponents.\n\nTheir objection is twofold: Bolton views Mulvaney as a key participant in the pressure campaign, a situation that the then-national security adviser referred to derisively as \"a drug deal,\" according to congressional testimony by his aides. The two men were barely on speaking terms when Bolton left his post in September, according to White House officials.\n\nMulvaney emerges as a key facilitator of the campaign to pressure Ukraine\n\nAnd they believe Mulvaney's goal is to avoid testifying by joining a suit involving officials whose attorney has argued they may be limited in what they can share with Congress because of their role advising the president on national security matters.\n\nHere are key moments from acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney's remarks to reporters about Ukraine on Oct. 17. (Video: Zach Purser Brown/The Washington Post)\n\nCharles Cooper, a lawyer for Bolton, declined to comment on Mulvaney's effort to join the suit, saying only, \"We will provide our answer in court.\"\n\nWilliam Pittard, an attorney for Mulvaney, said the chief of staff is simply seeking to resolve the competing demands of two branches of government.\n\n\"As acting chief of staff, Mr. Mulvaney intends to follow any lawful order of the president and has no reason to think that the order at issue is unlawful \u2014 other than the fact the House has threatened him with charges of contempt and obstruction for following it,\" he said.\n\nPittard said his client also dealt with national security issues when it came to Ukraine. \"Anything Mr. Mulvaney would be asked about would fall in to the same national security foreign relations space\" that would affect Bolton and Kupperman, he said.\n\nLaurence Tribe, a constitutional law expert at Harvard Law School, said Mulvaney's last-minute move could be an attempt to give himself legal cover to put off the House demand. By attaching himself to the Kupperman case, Mulvaney could avoid having to testify in the House inquiry for months if the suit is appealed all the way to the Supreme Court.\n\n\"I think he's trying to be shielded from having to obey his legal duty to comply with an obviously valid subpoena,\" Tribe said.\n\nBolton and Mulvaney are key potential witnesses in the House impeachment inquiry, but have so far refused to comply with requests to testify because of the White House claims that senior advisers have \"absolute immunity\" from cooperating with the congressional probe.\n\nTrump has repeatedly urged aides not to cooperate and was a key writer of a lengthy White House letter that decried the process, officials said.\n\nMulvaney had previously signaled he would follow the president's direction and not show up at the hearings, and his top aides also have rebuffed House requests for their testimony.\n\nThe acting chief of staff's legal filing Friday signals a shift in his approach toward the inquiry. Mulvaney is now attempting to join a lawsuit filed by officials who have signaled they would defy the White House and testify to Congress if so ordered.\n\nBolton willing to defy White House and testify if court clears the way, according to people familiar with his views\n\nIn going to court, Mulvaney appears to have acted on his own, hiring a private attorney to intervene in the suit. Typically, the White House Counsel's Office and the Justice Department would be involved in legal matters regarding the White House chief of staff.\n\nThe White House did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nPittard said Mulvaney's legal action was necessary to get clarity from the courts at a time when he faces an order from the White House not to comply and threats of contempt from the House.\n\n\"He is genuinely caught between two conflicting orders.\" Pittard said. \"He intends to follow the orders of his boss, the president, yet doing so has led to threats from the House. Asking the court to resolve a genuine conflict like this is not unreasonable in the least.\"\n\nPittard said White House Counsel Pat Cipollone was consulted before Mulvaney went to court and raised no objections. Mulvaney's legal filing, Pittard added, makes clear his action is aimed at the House, not the president.\n\n\"This is non-adversarial toward the president, and in no way indicates any distance between Mr. Mulvaney and the president,\" said a person close to Mulvaney, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe his thinking.\n\nHowever, the suit Mulvaney seeks to join lists the president and House leaders as defendants.\n\nThe unusual legal maneuvering lays bare a deepening divide among top advisers to Trump as House impeachment investigators continue to gather evidence about the effort to pressure Ukraine to open investigations into his political opponents.\n\nMulvaney has acknowledged that he blocked releasing nearly $400 million in military aid to Ukraine at the president's request. In an October news conference, Mulvaney said he withheld the aid because of the president's interest in having Ukraine investigate a discredited theory that Ukrainians interfered in the 2016 campaign. Mulvaney later said his comments were misinterpreted.\n\nIf Bolton is ordered to testify, he is expected to corroborate the accounts of former aides \u2014 such as Lt. Col. Alexander S. Vindman and adviser Fiona Hill \u2014 who testified that Bolton was alarmed that military aide was being withheld from Ukraine as the president and his aides pushed that country to open investigations that could damage Democrats.\n\n4 big takeaways from Fiona Hill's and Alexander Vindman's transcripts\n\nIn a letter to House Democrats on Friday, Cooper wrote that Bolton was \"personally involved in many of the events, meetings, and conversations about which you have already received testimony, as well as many relevant meetings and conversations that have not yet been discussed in the testimonies thus far.\"\n\nCongressional investigators have not yet subpoenaed Bolton, though they have sought his appearance, a request Cooper said he would decline without a subpoena and an instruction from the courts.\n\nIn his letter Friday, Cooper emphasized that Bolton and Kupperman's testimony was particularly important and sensitive because of the role they played in national security matters.\n\n\"Information concerning national security and foreign affairs is at the heart of the Committees' impeachment inquiry, and it is difficult to imagine any question that the Committees might put to Dr. Kupperman that would not implicate these sensitive areas,\" he wrote.\n\nHe noted that Kupperman and Bolton could receive special immunity from testifying because they are part of \"an exceedingly narrow category of aides entrusted with discretionary authority in such sensitive areas as national security or foreign policy.\"\n\nMulvaney's legal filing could breathe new life into the Kupperman suit after House lawyers withdrew their subpoena of him last week and asked for the case to be dismissed. Instead, the House said it would look to another case involving former White House counsel Donald McGahn, which is more advanced, as a key test case.\n\nHowever, presiding U.S. District Judge Richard Leon declined to dismiss the Kupperman suit. Late Saturday afternoon, Leon ordered lawyers for Mulvaney, Kupperman, Bolton and the government to join him in a conference call Monday afternoon to discuss Mulvaney's request and how to proceed."

        "text": "Read Marie Yovanovitch's prepared opening remarks below. Follow our live coverage of today's hearing, and read House Intelligence Chairman Adam Schiff's opening statement.\n\nMr. Chairman, Ranking Member Nunes, and other Members of the Committee: Thank you for the opportunity to start with this statement, to reintroduce myself to the Committee and to highlight parts of my biography and experience. My Background I come before you as an American citizen, who has devoted the majority of my life, 33 years, to service to the country that all of us love. Like my colleagues, I entered the Foreign Service understanding that my job was to implement the foreign policy interests of this nation, as defined by the President and Congress, and to do so regardless of which person or party was in power. I had no agenda other than to pursue our stated foreign policy goals.\n\nMy service is an expression of gratitude for all that this country has given my family and me. My late parents did not have the good fortune to come of age in a free society. My father fled the Soviets before ultimately finding refuge in the United States. My mother's family escaped the USSR after the Bolshevik revolution, and she grew up stateless in Nazi Germany, before eventually making her way to the United States. Their personal histories\u2014my personal history\u2014gave me both deep Statement of Marie L. Yovanovitch \u2014 Page 2 gratitude towards the United States and great empathy for others\u2014like the Ukrainian people\u2014who want to be free.\n\nI joined the Foreign Service during the Reagan Administration and subsequently served three other Republican Presidents, as well as two Democratic Presidents. It was my great honor to be appointed to serve as an ambassador three times\u2014 twice by President George W. Bush and once by President Barack Obama.\n\nThere is a perception that diplomats lead a comfortable life throwing dinner parties in fancy homes. Let me tell you about some of my reality. It has not always been easy. I have moved 13 times and served in seven different countries, five of them hardship posts.\n\nMy first tour was Mogadishu, Somalia, an increasingly dangerous place, as that country's civil war kept grinding on and the government was weakening. The military took over policing functions in a particularly brutal way and many basic services disappeared.\n\nSeveral years later, after the Soviet Union collapsed, I helped open our Embassy in Tashkent, Uzbekistan. As we were establishing relations with a new country, our small Embassy was attacked by a gunman, who sprayed the Embassy building with gunfire.\n\nI later served in Moscow. In 1993, during the attempted coup in Russia, I was caught in crossfire between presidential and parliamentary forces. It took us three tries\u2014me without a helmet or body armor\u2014to get into a vehicle to go to the Embassy. We Statement of Marie L. Yovanovitch \u2014 Page 3 went to the Embassy, because the Ambassador asked us to come. We went, because it was our duty.\n\nMy Service in Ukraine\nFrom August 2016 until May 2019, I served as the U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine. During my tenure in Ukraine, I went to the Front Line approximately ten times during a shooting war: to show the American flag, to hear what was going on (sometimes literally as we heard the impact of artillery), and to see how our assistance dollars were being put to use.\n\nI worked to advance U.S. policy\u2014fully embraced by Democrats and Republicans alike\u2014to help Ukraine become a stable and independent democratic state, with a market economy integrated into Europe. A secure, democratic, and free Ukraine serves not just the Ukrainian people, but the American people as well. That's why it was our policy to help the Ukrainians achieve their objectives\u2014they matched our objectives.\n\nThe War Against Russia\nThe U.S. is the most powerful country in the history of the world, in large part because of our values. And our values have made possible the network of alliances and partnerships that buttresses our own strength. Ukraine, with an enormous landmass and a large population, has the potential to be a significant commercial and political partner for the U.S., as well as a force-multiplier on the security side.\n\nWe see the potential in Ukraine. Russia, by contrast, sees the risk. The history is not written yet, but Ukraine could move Statement of Marie L. Yovanovitch \u2014 Page 4 out of Russia's orbit. And now Ukraine is a battleground for great power competition, with a hot war for the control of territory and a hybrid war to control Ukraine's leadership. The U.S. has provided significant security assistance since the onset of the war against Russia in 2014. And as is well-known, the Trump administration strengthened our policy by approving the provision to Ukraine of anti-tank missiles known as Javelins.\n\nSupporting Ukraine is the right thing to do. It is also the smart thing to do. If Russia prevails and Ukraine falls to Russian dominion, we can expect to see other attempts by Russia to expand its territory and influence.\n\nThe War Against Corruption\nAs critical as the war against Russia is, Ukraine's struggling democracy has an equally important challenge: Battling the Soviet legacy of corruption, which has pervaded Ukraine's government. Corruption makes Ukraine's leaders ever vulnerable to Russia, and the Ukrainian people understand that. That's why they launched the Revolution of Dignity in 2014 demanding to be a part of Europe, demanding the transformation of the system, demanding to live under the rule of law. Ukrainians wanted the law to apply equally to all persons, whether the individual in question is the president or any other citizen. It was a question of fairness, of dignity.\n\nHere, again, there is a coincidence of interests. Corrupt leaders are inherently less trustworthy, while an honest and accountable Ukrainian leadership makes a U.S.-Ukrainian partnership more reliable and more valuable to the United States.\n\nA level playing field in this strategically-located country bordering four NATO allies, creates an environment in which U.S. business can more easily trade, invest, and profit. Corruption is also a security issue, because corrupt officials are vulnerable to Moscow. In short, it is in America's national security interest to help Ukraine transform into a country where the rule of law governs and corruption is held in check. It was\u2014 and remains\u2014a top U.S. priority to help Ukraine fight corruption. Significant progress has been made since the 2014 Revolution of Dignity.\n\nUnfortunately, as the past couple of months have underlined, not all Ukrainians embraced our anti-corruption work. Thus, perhaps, it was not surprising, that when our anti-corruption efforts got in the way of a desire for profit or power, Ukrainians who preferred to play by the old, corrupt rules sought to remove me. What continues to amaze me is that they found Americans willing to partner with them and, working together, they apparently succeeded in orchestrating the removal of a U.S. Ambassador.\n\nHow could our system fail like this? How is it that foreign corrupt interests could manipulate our government? Which country's interests are served when the very corrupt behavior we have been criticizing is allowed to prevail? Such conduct undermines the U.S., exposes our friends, and widens the playing field for autocrats like President Putin. Our leadership depends on the power of our example and the consistency of our purpose. Both have now been opened to question.\n\nAddressing Specific Concerns\nWith that background in mind, I would like briefly to address some of the factual issues I expect you may want to ask me about, starting with my timeline in Ukraine and the events about which I do and do not have first-hand knowledge.\n\nEvents Before and After I Served in Ukraine\nI arrived in Ukraine on August 22, 2016 and left Ukraine permanently on May 20, 2019. There are a number of events you are investigating to which I cannot bring any first-hand knowledge. The events that pre-dated my Ukraine service include:\n\n\u00b0the release of the so-called \"Black Ledger\" and Mr. Manafort's subsequent resignation from President Trump's campaign; and\n\n\u00b0the departure from office of former Prosecutor General Viktor Shokin.\n\nSeveral other events occurred after I returned from Ukraine. These include:\n\n\u00b0President Trump's July 25, 2019 call with President Zelenskiy;\n\n\u00b0The discussions surrounding that phone call; and\n\n\u00b0Any discussions surrounding the delay of security assistance to Ukraine in Summer 2019.\n\nDuring my Tenure in Ukraine\nAs for events during my tenure in Ukraine:\n\n\u00b0I want to reiterate first that the allegation that I disseminated a \"Do Not Prosecute\" list was a fabrication. Mr. Lutsenko, the former Ukrainian Prosecutor General who made that allegation, has acknowledged that the list never existed.\n\n\u00b0I did not tell Mr. Lutsenko or other Ukrainian officials who they should or should not prosecute. Instead, I advocated the U.S. position that rule of law should prevail and Ukrainian law enforcement, prosecutors, and judges should stop wielding their power selectively, as a political weapon against their adversaries, and start dealing with all consistently and according to the law.\n\n\u00b0Also untrue are unsourced allegations that I told unidentified Embassy employees or Ukrainian officials that President Trump's orders should be ignored because \"he was going to be impeached\"\u2014or for any other reason. I did not and would not say such a thing. Such statements would be inconsistent with my training as a Foreign Service Officer and my role as an Ambassador.\n\n\u00b0The Obama administration did not ask me to help the Clinton campaign or harm the Trump campaign, nor would I have taken any such steps if they had. Partisanship of this type is not compatible with the role of a career Foreign Service Officer.\n\n\u00b0I have never met Hunter Biden, nor have I had any direct or indirect conversations with him. And although I have met former Vice President Biden several times over the course of our many years in government, neither he nor the previous Administration ever raised the issue of either Burisma or Hunter Biden with me.\n\n\u00b0With respect to Mayor Giuliani, I have had only minimal contacts with him\u2014a total of three. None related to the events at issue. I do not understand Mr. Giuliani's motives for attacking me, nor can I offer an opinion on whether he believed the allegations he spread about me. Clearly, no one at the State Department did. What I can say is that Mr. Giuliani should have known those claims were suspect, coming as they reportedly did from individuals with questionable motives and with reason to believe that their political and financial ambitions would be stymied by our anti-corruption policy in Ukraine.\n\nMy Departure from Ukraine\nAfter being asked by the Under Secretary of State for Political Affairs in early March 2019 to extend my tour until 2020, the smear campaign against me entered a new public phase in the United States. In the wake of the negative press, State Department officials suggested an earlier departure, and we agreed upon July 2019. I was then abruptly told just weeks later, in late April, to come back to Washington from Ukraine \"on the next plane.\" At the time I departed, Ukraine had just concluded game-changing presidential elections. It was a sensitive period with much at stake for the U.S. and called for all the experience and expertise we could muster.\n\nWhen I returned to the United States, Deputy Secretary of State Sullivan told me there had been a concerted campaign against me, that the President no longer wished me to serve as Ambassador to Ukraine, and that in fact, the President had been pushing for my removal since the prior summer. As Mr. Sullivan recently recounted during his Senate confirmation hearing, neither he nor anyone else ever explained or sought to justify the President's concerns about me, nor did anyone in the Department justify my early departure by suggesting I had done something wrong. I appreciate that Mr. Sullivan publicly affirmed at his hearing that I had served \"capably and admirably.\"\n\nAlthough, then and now, I have always understood that I served at the pleasure of the President, I still find it difficult to comprehend that foreign and private interests were able to undermine U.S. interests in this way. Individuals, who apparently felt stymied by our efforts to promote stated U.S. policy against corruption\u2014that is, to do the mission\u2014were able to successfully conduct a campaign of disinformation against a sitting Ambassador, using unofficial back channels. As various witnesses have recounted, they shared baseless allegations with the President and convinced him to remove his Ambassador, despite the fact that the State Department fully understood that the allegations were false and the sources highly suspect.\n\nThese events should concern everyone in this room. Ambassadors are the symbol of the United States abroad, the personal representatives of the President. They should always act and speak with full authority to advocate for U.S. policies. If our chief representative is kneecapped, it limits our effectiveness to safeguard the vital national security interests of the United States. This is especially important now, when the international landscape is more complicated and more competitive than it has been since the dissolution of the Soviet Union.\n\nOur Ukraine policy has been thrown into disarray, and shady interests the world over have learned how little it takes to remove an American Ambassador who does not give them what they want. After these events, what foreign official, corrupt or not, could be blamed for wondering whether the Ambassador represents the President's views? And what U.S. Ambassador could be blamed for harboring the fear that they cannot count on our government to support them as they implement stated U.S. policy and defend U.S. interests?\n\n*********\nI would like to comment on one other matter before taking your questions. At the closed deposition, I expressed grave concerns about the degradation of the Foreign Service over the past few years and the failure of State Department leadership to push back as foreign and corrupt interests apparently hijacked our Ukraine policy. I remain disappointed that the Department's leadership and others have declined to acknowledge that the attacks against me and others are dangerously wrong.\n\nThis is about far more than me or a couple of individuals. As Foreign Service professionals are being denigrated and undermined, the institution is also being degraded. This will soon cause real harm, if it hasn't already. The State Department as a tool of foreign policy often doesn't get the same attention and respect as the military might of the Pentagon does, but we are\u2014 as they say\u2014\"the pointy end of the spear.\" If we lose our edge, the U.S. will inevitably have to use other tools, even more often than it does today. And those other tools are blunter, more expensive, and not universally effective.\n\nMoreover, the attacks are leading to a crisis in the State Department as the policy process is visibly unravelling, leadership vacancies go unfilled, and senior and midlevel officers ponder an uncertain future and head for the doors. The crisis has moved from the impact on individuals to an impact on the institution. The State Department is being hollowed out from within at a competitive and complex time on the world stage. This is not a time to undercut our diplomats.\n\nIt is the responsibility of the Department's leaders to stand up for the institution and the individuals who make that institution the most effective diplomatic force in the world. And Congress has a responsibility to reinvest in our diplomacy. That's an investment in our national security, an investment in our future.\n\nAs I close, let me be clear on who we are and how we serve this country. We are professionals, public servants who by vocation and training pursue the policies of the President, regardless of who holds that office or what party they affiliate with. We handle American Citizen Services, facilitate trade and commerce, work security issues, represent the U.S., and report to and advise Washington, to mention just a few of our functions.\n\nAnd we make a difference every day.\n\nWe are people who repeatedly uproot our lives, who risk\u2014 and sometimes give\u2014our lives for this country.\n\nWe are the fifty-two Americans who forty years ago this month began 444 days of deprivation, torture and captivity in Teheran.\n\nWe are the dozens of Americans stationed at our embassy in Cuba and consulates in China, who mysteriously and dangerously\u2014and in some cases perhaps permanently\u2014were injured in attacks from unknown sources several years ago.\n\nAnd we are Ambassador Chris Stevens, Sean Patrick Smith, Ty Woods, and Glen Doherty\u2014people rightly called heroes for their ultimate sacrifice to this nation's foreign policy interests in Libya, eight years ago.\n\nWe honor these individuals. They represent each one of you here\u2014and every American. These courageous individuals were attacked because they symbolized America.\n\nWhat you need to know, what the American people need to know, is that while, thankfully, most of us answer the call to duty in less dramatic ways, every Foreign Service Officer runs these same risks. And, very often, so do our families. They serve too. As individuals, as a community, we answer the call to duty to advance and protect the interests of the United States.\n\nWe take our oath of office seriously, the same oath that each one of you take, \"to support and defend the Constitution of the United States against all enemies, foreign and domestic\" and to \"bear true faith and allegiance to the same.\"\n\nI count myself lucky to be a Foreign Service Officer, fortunate to serve with the best America has to offer, blessed to serve the American people for the last 33 years.\n\nThank you for your attention. I welcome your questions."

        "text": "In her first press conference since public impeachment hearings began, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi on Thursday scolded reporters who used Republican talking points about the whistleblower \u2014 the anonymous intelligence official whose identity President Trump and his allies are insisting must be made public.\n\n\"When you talk about the whistleblower, you're coming into my wheelhouse,\" Pelosi said. \"The whistleblower is there to speak truth to power and have protection for doing that. And any retribution or harm coming toward a whistleblower undermines our ability to hear truth about power. So I will defend the rights about the whistleblower vehemently.\"\n\nThe House speaker also accused the president of \"bribery\" in his actions related to Ukraine.\n\nSpeaking to reporters after Wednesday's hearings, Trump said, \"I want to find out who is the whistleblower because the whistleblower gave a lot of very incorrect information, including my call with the president of Ukraine, which was a perfect call and highly appropriate.\"\n\nPelosi said that Trump has every right to present \"exculpatory\" evidence to the House committees leading the impeachment inquiry.\n\n\"If the president has something that is exculpatory \u2014 Mr. President, that means you have anything that shows your innocence \u2014 then he should make that known,\" Pelosi said. \"So far we haven't see that.\"\n\n\"But nobody \u2014 nobody, the president is not above the law, the president will be held accountable \u2014 and nobody should have the right to endanger whistleblowers,\" the speaker added.\n\nHer comments came a day after two witnesses \u2014 Bill Taylor, the top U.S. diplomat in Ukraine, and State Department official George Kent \u2014 testified that they believed Trump would not grant Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky an Oval Office meeting or release $400 million in aid until Zelensky announced investigations of former Vice President Joe Biden, his son Hunter Biden, and a debunked conspiracy theory about alleged electoral interference by Ukraine in the 2016 election.\n\nPelosi said their testimony \"corroborated evidence of bribery.\"\n\n\"The president abused power and violated his oath by threatening to withhold military aid and a White House meeting in exchange for an investigation into his political rival \u2014 a clear attempt for the president to give himself an advantage in the 2020 election,\" she said.\n\n\"The bribe is to grant or withhold military assistance [in exchange for] a public statement of a fake investigation into the elections,\" Pelosi continued. \"That's bribery.\"\n\n\"What the president has admitted to and says is \u2018perfect' is perfectly wrong,\" she added. \"It's bribery.\"\n\nTrump and his Republican allies argued that both Taylor and Kent relied on second- and thirdhand information in their testimony. The House speaker warned Americans not to be distracted by that argument, noting that the White House has blocked current and former administration officials who do have firsthand knowledge \u2014 including acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney and former national security adviser John Bolton \u2014 from appearing before investigators.\n\n\"Don't fall into the secondhand stuff,\" Pelosi said. \"That's a fraudulent proposition put forth by the Republicans. They obstruct everyone who they would regard to have firsthand knowledge.\"\n\nPelosi said she takes no joy in Trump's possible impeachment, but that it is Congress's duty to defend the Constitution against \"all enemies, foreign and domestic.\"\n\n\"This is something we do with a heavy heart. This is very prayerful,\" she said. \"But we must uphold our oath of office.\"\n\nPelosi also compared the impeachment case against Trump to the case against President Richard Nixon, who ultimately resigned before the House could vote on the articles of impeachment.\n\n\"What President Trump has done on the record in terms of asking a foreign power to help him in his own election and the obstruction of information about that, the cover-up, makes what Nixon did look almost small,\" she said."

Kevin Stitt said at a press conference that communications with the tribes broke down late last month and he wanted to present his case to the Oklahoma people.\n\n\"The fact of the matter is they have refused to communicate with me,\" Stitt said. \"This is going to cause extreme uncertainty if we don't have a new compact before Jan. 1, 2020.\"\n\nThe two sides disagree over the key issue of whether the compacts automatically renew for another 15-year term on Jan. 1 if the two sides can't reach an agreement.\n\nStitt suggested the state's current rate of between 4% and 10% of tribal gambling revenue should be larger.\n\nTribal leaders have said they're willing to renegotiate the rates, but not until Stitt acknowledges the compacts automatically renew if a deal can't be reached.\n\n\"The tribes are unified in their position that the compacts renew and they're going to continue to operate,\" said Stephen Greetham, senior attorney for the Chickasaw Nation, one of the most powerful in the state. \"If Gov. Stitt wants to force the issue ... he would have to go to court and try to get some kind of order to shut the casinos down. Barring that, we're just going to continue to operate and we're going to continue remitting our revenue-share payments to the state and we're going to continue to grow, as we have for the last 15 years.\"\n\nCasino gambling is a booming industry in Oklahoma, with more than 130 casinos now dotting the state since voters approved a gambling expansion in 2004.\n\nUnder the compacts, tribes pay the state \"exclusivity fees\" in exchange for the exclusive right to operate casinos. Those fees generated nearly $139 million for the state last year, most of it earmarked for education, on roughly $2.3 billion in revenue from games covered under the compacts."

        "text": "Rep. Lee Zeldin, R-N.Y., has called the impeachment probe into President Donald Trump a \"charade,\" a \"clown show,\" and a \"cocktail that is\" House Intelligence Chairman Adam Schiff's \"favorite drink to get America drunk on.\"\n\nNaturally, there's an occupant in the Oval Office who's taken notice of his strong words. And, in turn, a once little-known, 39-year-old lawmaker representing eastern Long Island has become one of the president's point men in battling impeachment, teaming up with fellow anti-impeachment crusaders such as House Freedom Caucus Chairman Mark Meadows, R-N.C., and Rep. Jim Jordan, R-Ohio.\n\n\"For me, it's just about getting facts out there and getting the rest of the story out there. Adam Schiff isn't going to do that for my constituents,\" Zeldin told NBC News in an interview when asked about the risk of going all in on Trump's defense. \"And I have a lot of constituents who oppose this impeachment inquiry. Most of the calls my office receives are from people who are opposed to this impeachment inquiry. This isn't an issue, obviously, that's going to unite a country.\"\n\n\"As a matter of fact, an impeachment inquiry like this rips the country in half,\" he continued. \"So I'm not expecting unanimous calls to come into my office in opposition to the impeachment inquiry. We hear from people who oppose the president. And quite frankly, many of those people have opposed the president since the day he was elected and sworn into office.\"\n\nIn the seven impeachment deposition transcripts released so far, no Republican has spoken more than Zeldin, who is referenced more than 550 times, according to an NBC News tally. His attempts to steer the depositions away from Trump's conduct and toward a host of tangential matters\u2014 including the Biden family, a conspiracy theory about the 2016 election, and even the witnesses' own credibility \u2014 have driven counsel for multiple witnesses to their wit's end.\n\n\"With all respect, congressman, we've now been here for eight and a half hours and Ambassador Sondland has not declined to answer a single question posed by any member or any counsel member,\" Robert Luskin, the attorney for the ambassador to the European Union, Gordon Sondland, told Zeldin last month after the Long Island lawmaker asked over and over about the merits of asking Ukraine to probe the Bidens' ties to a Ukrainian gas company. \"You've asked this question now three different times. I know you're unhappy with his answer, but if we stay until 7:30, he's not going to change his answer.\"\n\nZeldin was indefatigable. He pressed Sondland again on why it would have been okay for Trump to want Ukraine to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden and his son Hunter, tearing into the ambassador over his earlier answers.\n\n\"[M]ore questions I don't think are going to assist you any further,\" Luskin said. \"I think you've asked it about as many times as you can.\"\n\nIn return for Zeldin's pertinacity, Trump has shown appreciation by tweeting or retweeting the New York lawmaker's commentary on the investigation nearly two dozen times since the inquiry was launched in late September, including nine times in the early morning hours Saturday. Previously, the president had promoted Zeldin on Twitter only once to endorse his 2018 re-election bid.\n\nUnlike his counterparts Jordan and Meadows, Zeldin doesn't reside in an uber-safe Republican district. While Trump won New York's 1st congressional district by 12 points in 2016, Zeldin won re-election in 2018 by just 4 percentage points, and 2020 could feature another hotly contested race.\n\nZeldin's loyalty to Trump, as well as his attacks on the impeachment process, has been met with much chagrin from Democrats. One House Democratic aide said Zeldin was \"maybe the best instance I've seen of someone using emulating Trump as a pathway to relevance.\"\n\nBut Zeldin, who served in the military, wasn't a Trump acolyte from the get-go. The congressman only endorsed Trump after the former reality TV star cleared the 2016 Republican field and even in the years that followed, he was not averse to criticizing the president and those close to him.\n\n\"I voted for @POTUS last Nov. & want him & USA to succeed, but that meeting, given that email chain just released, is a big no-no,\" Zeldin tweeted in July 2017 after president's eldest son, Donald Trump Jr., acknowledged his role in arranging a 2016 meeting with a Kremlin-connected lawyer in the hopes of landing dirt on then-Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton.\n\nAsked if he similarly saw anything wrong with the president's conduct toward Ukraine, Zeldin declined to answer, telling NBC News instead that, \"I, too, am concerned with corruption in Ukraine.\"\n\nRep. Pete King, R-N.Y., who represents the Long Island district next door to Zeldin's, said he hasn't been all that surprised that Zeldin, who sits on one of the three committees able to take part in the impeachment probe, has become one of Trump's staunchest impeachment defenders.\n\n\"Well, I know that he feels strongly about it,\" King said of Zeldin's thoughts on the investigation. \"I know that he and the president get along. I think this could be just the first time he's really had an opportunity because he's on one of the committees. Once you're in it, it's hard to go halfway.\"\n\nMeanwhile, since Zeldin's earlier criticism of Trump Jr.'s emails, the two men have become \"close,\" as a source close to both Trump Jr. and Zeldin told NBC News. Trump Jr. headlined a fundraiser for Zeldin last year and is slated to headline another event for the Long Island congressman later this month.\n\n\"I know Don appreciates the fact that Lee is a fighter,\" this person said, adding that what makes Zeldin \"so fascinating is he's the rare guy ... who works closely with both the Freedom Caucus\" and moderate Republicans.\n\nIn Zeldin's district, which spans from working-class central Long Island to the wealthy enclave of the Hamptons, voters expressed mixed thoughts on his newfound prominence.\n\nRob Mauro, a 64-year-old construction manager and self-identified Republican, said that Zeldin is doing \"as best he can\" on a \"nonsense\" impeachment probe. But Mauro said he was at least a little surprised to see Zeldin featured so prominently.\n\nMeanwhile, since Zeldin's earlier criticism of Trump Jr.'s emails, the two men have become \"close,\" as a source close to both Trump Jr. and Zeldin told NBC News.

Public hearings, which are slated to start this week, will be heard in front of solely the House Intelligence Committee. That sparked Republican leadership to swap a staunch Trump ally in Jordan onto the panel. Zeldin remains on the outside.\n\nHe'd \"be happy to\" join, though he said it's \"a decision to be made above my pay grade.\"\n\n\"I'd be able to contribute to the process of the American public getting the entire story and not just the parts of it,\" he said."

Holmes' testimony places Trump closer to the push for Ukraine to open an investigation into his political rival, and raises additional questions about the testimony of Sondland, who is scheduled to testify publicly next week.\n\n\"Sondland told Trump that Zelensky \u2018loves your ass,' \" Holmes said, according to a copy of his opening statement. \"I then heard President Trump ask, \u2018So, he's gonna do the investigation?' Ambassador Sondland replied that \u2018he's gonna do it,' adding that President Zelensky will do \u2018anything you ask him to.'\"\n\nHolmes, who was subpoenaed to appear on Friday, explained that Sondland had placed the call to Trump, and he could hear Trump because the call was so loud on the terrace of a restaurant, where they dined with two others.\n\n\"While Ambassador Sondland's phone was not on speakerphone, I could hear the President's voice through the earpiece of the phone. The President's voice was very loud and recognizable, and Ambassador Sondland held the phone away from his ear for a period of time, presumably because of the loud volume,\" Holmes testified.\n\nDavid Holmes, aide to top U.S. diplomat in Ukraine William B.

OK,\" said Rep.

Every time Rudy gets involved he goes and f\u2014s everything up.\"\n\nHolmes said former national security adviser John Bolton expressed frustration to Taylor and National Security Council aide Tim Morrison about Giuliani's influence with the President. Bolton indicated at the meeting that the lifting of the aid would hang on whether Zelensky was able to \"favorably impress\" Trump, when they were scheduled to meet in Warsaw in September.

But Holmes said that Taylor told him on September 8: \"Now they're insisting Zelensky commit to the investigation in an interview with CNN.\"\n\n\"I was surprised the requirement was so specific and concrete,\" Holmes said.\n\n\"While we had advised our Ukrainian counterparts to voice a commitment to following the rule of law and generally to investigating credible corruption allegations, this was a demand that President Zelensky personally commit to a specific investigation of President Trump's political rival on a cable news channel,\" Holmes said.\n\nHolmes said that on September 13, two days after the freeze on security aid was lifted, Taylor had met with Zelensky and they ran into Zelensky's aide, Andriy Yermak, as they left. Holmes said Taylor stressed the importance of staying out of US politics and he hoped no interview was planned, but Yermak \"shrugged in resignation and did not answer, as if to indicate they had no choice,\" Holmes testified.\n\nHolmes' testimony also explains how he ended up with Sondland at the restaurant. He said Sondland was in meetings in Ukraine with Taylor and others, and that when Taylor was departing Kiev, Holmes offered to go to lunch with Sondland to get briefed on the July 25 call. Holmes also said that he was supposed to be included in a meeting between Sondland and Yermak. Holmes said he was supposed to be a note-taker for the meeting, but when he arrived he was told by an aide to Yermak that they wanted a one-on-one meeting with \"no note-taker.\"\n\nOn the call, Sondland also talked to Trump about the US rapper who had been arrested in Sweden, A$AP Rocky, telling Trump that Sweden \"should have released him on your word,\" and later adding that Trump could \"tell the Kardashians you tried.\"\n\nThis story has been updated with additional developments Friday."

        "text": "We've got some breaking news this morning, Deval Patrick has in fact officially joined the large presidential field.\n\nHere is what you need to know. Patrick served as Massachusetts Governor from 2006 to 2012 and according to Politico a who's who of Obama insiders had previously encouraged Patrick to jump into the race to include David Axelrod, Valerie Jarret, and Mr. Obama himself. In addition to his political work, Deval Patrick has taken full advantage of the opportunities to cash in that are made available to prominent government officials. He was particularly well positioned given his own trailblazing status and background as a civil rights attorney.\n\nFor example, shortly after Patrick settled a massive racial discrimination lawsuit with Texaco in his capacity at the DOJ, he walked right on through that revolving door over to work for Texaco as their VP and General Counsel. Then, he took a job as Coca-Cola's top in-house counsel shortly after they too settled a massive racial discrimination lawsuit. But perhaps most egregious was his time at subprime mortgage giant Ameriquest, a company famous for pressuring working class families into taking on mortgages they couldn't possibly hope to pay and then brutally foreclosing on them and seizing their homes. And today, he's managing director at that singularly beloved American institution, Bain Capital.\n\nAs Zach Carter at the Huffington Post put it: \"In corporate America, Patrick was not so much a reformer as he was a public relations figure. He gave corporations a story to tell about the good things they were supposedly doing \u2015 even when they were simultaneously busying themselves with very bad things.\"\n\nRapacious, predatory, corporatist with close ties to both Clinton and Obama world. Meet your 2020 dream candidate ladies and gentlemen!\n\nI don't doubt that Patrick will be able to raise some money given his political and business ties and the incredible angst apparently gripping the Democratic donor community but unless something truly wild were to happen like Obama deciding to actually endorse him, I got a hard time imagining Patrick gaining much ground. First of all, primary voters are actually quite satisfied with their choices. Those looking for a safe Obama throwback are good with Biden, those looking for a more progressive traditional politician like Warren, and those who are in search of a more radical change are in for Bernie. What's more, Patrick is going to have a tough time making it into the debates that are left given the difficult donor and polling thresholds. Is a grassroots movement going to spontaneously spring up to give a managing director of Bain Capital the 200,000 donations he would need? Not seeing that one.\n\nBut, that doesn't mean that Patrick's run won't impact the race. And there's one candidate who he could be particularly troublesome for. It's Elizabeth Warren. One of the strengths Warren has is her status as neighbor to the first in the nation primary state of New Hampshire. Her familiarity to New Hampshire voters and strength with affluent white liberals in-particular is a big plus for her there and is part of why she's invested so heavily in the granite state.\n\nBut Deval Patrick hails from the same state as Warren so he is also well known to New Hampshire voters and he also could hold appeal for a certain affluent white demographic. He's a wine track candidate and she's a wine track candidate. And in New Hampshire right now every tiny movement counts.\n\nTake a look at this. This is the current RCP average of polls in New Hampshire and it shows a three-way tie race between Biden, Warren, and Bernie.\n\nMoreover, this is a state that has at times seen Biden lead, at times, has seen Warren lead and at times has seen Bernie lead. It really is anyone's game. So even if Patrick steals a point or two from Warren, it could make all the difference.\n\nThere's another element to this as well though. Warren may have created a bit of a mess for herself on this Deval Patrick situation. When she was recently asked by Angela Rye what 3 African Americans she must have in her cabinet, guess who topped the list? Bain Capital's own Deval Patrick.\n\nHere in part is Warren's response to Angela's question about African Americans in her cabinet:\n\nPretty terrific guy. Hmmmmm. This response caught my eye at the time because any administration stocked with Texaco, Ameriquest, Bain Capital types is an administration that will do nothing but continue the current destruction of the working class. But given Deval's entrance into the race, it's really aged poorly and very quickly.\n\nAs Ryan Grim pointed out, Warren's name-checking of Patrick as somebody she'd welcome in her administration was quite an own-goal, makes it awfully hard to point out that he's a predatory capitalist by profession.\n\nIndeed. Kind of hard to be a predatory capitalist and a pretty terrific guy who you must have in a Warren cabinet.\n\nNow I know a lot of the punditocracy is thinking Patrick could have his biggest early state impact in South Carolina where it is simplistically believed that because he is black, black voters will move from the underwhelming Biden to back him. You can ask Cory Booker and Kamala Harris how that strategy is working out for them. Look anything's possible but it seems unlikely to me that Biden backers are looking to trade-in Barack Obama's loyal 2 term Vice President for a guy they don't really know, friend of Obama though he may be. After all, working class African Americans didn't ask Deval Patrick to get into the race, wealthy elites did. And as we always say on this show, looking at who supports a candidate is way more important than who they claim to represent. So don't look at South Carolina, keep your eye instead on New Hampshire. If Deval Patrick is going to make any kind of splash in the race it will likely be there and it will likely be to the detriment of Elizabeth Warren. Also, Senator Warren, with respect, please get some better answers on who you want in your cabinet because this ain't it."

        "text": "The impeachment inquiry into President Trump continues in the House. Follow here for the latest news.\n\n10:21 p.m. ET, November 14, 2019\nOur live coverage of the impeachment inquiry has ended for the day. Read up on the latest news below.\n\n9:45 p.m. ET, November 14, 2019\nJustice Department asks to dismiss Kupperman subpoena lawsuit\nFrom CNN's Katelyn Polantz\n\nThe Justice Department, speaking for the White House, has asked a federal judge to dismiss a lawsuit from a former national security official over whether he should testify under House subpoena.\n\nThe new filing is the first time the administration had formally taken a position in this lawsuit after former administration official Charles Kupperman sued, claiming he was torn between his House impeachment inquiry subpoena and the White House\u8ab7 assertion of immunity. He still has not testified.\n\nThe Department of Justice (DOJ) calls the House subpoena power a \u8963rave threat?to the confidentiality of the presidency in the filing tonight.\n\n\u893cr. Charles Kupperman seeks an opinion from this Court on whether the President\u8ab7 senior-most advisors share the President\u8ab7 absolute immunity from testimonial compulsion by Congress. Although the answer to that critical question is undoubtedly \u8a59es,?Dr. Kupperman has no business asking this Court to answer it,\" the DOJ said.\nKupperman, in this case, has been widely considered a stand in for former national security adviser John Bolton, and acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney late last week tried to join Kupperman\u8ab7 lawsuit, before ducking out of it.\n\nThe lawsuit is not expected to be resolved until, at earliest, after a mid-December court hearing. At this point, the White House is aligned with the House in its ultimate goal of dismissing the case.\n\n9:23 p.m. ET, November 14, 2019\nTrump claims the impeachment inquiry has been hard on his family\nFrom CNN's Nikki Carvajal \n\nA combative President Trump mocked Democrats and lamented how hard impeachment proceedings have been on his family tonight at a rally in Louisiana, but also said that Republicans have asked him to \u8968eep this sucker going for a while?\n\n\u8942t\u8ab7 been very hard on my family,?Trump said, \u8942t\u8ab7 been very unfair. You think this is fun don\u8ab8 you? But it\u8ab7 been very hard on my family, very, very hard.?Trump added that Republicans have, \u896feally stuck together, it\u8ab7 a beautiful thing to see.?\nHe claimed the proceedings have been so good for the party that Republicans want to keep them going.\n\n9:14 p.m. ET, November 14, 2019\nTrump incorrectly takes credit for liquefied natural gas facility in Louisiana\nFrom CNN's Daniel Dale\n\nPresident Trump said the whole country is doing well economically, but said Louisiana is doing poorly compared with other states even after, he said, \"I gave you\" a $10 billion liquefied natural gas facility he visited earlier in the year.\n\nThe Cameron LNG facility received its permits during President Barack Obama's tenure, as the facility's website explains. \n\nTrump has repeatedly claimed that he was responsible for getting these permits. He did not have anything to do with them.\n\n9:08 p.m. ET, November 14, 2019\nTrump makes false claims about the Bidens and Ukraine\nFrom CNN's Daniel Dale\n\nPresident Trump recounted two of his regular false claims about the Bidens' dealings in Ukraine tonight during a rally in Louisiana.\n\nTrump claimed there is evidence of \"corruption\" in the 2018 video of former Vice President Joe Biden explaining how he pressured Ukrainian leaders to fire the country's prosecutor general.\n\nThere is no evidence of corruption in the video; the prosecutor was widely considered ineffective or corrupt and Biden was executing official US policy.\n\nTrump also claimed that this prosecutor, Viktor Shokin, was investigating Joe Biden's son Hunter Biden. There is no evidence Hunter Biden was ever under investigation, and Shokin's former deputy has said that even the probe into the owner of Burisma, the company where Hunter Biden sat on the board, was dormant at the time Joe Biden applied his pressure.\n\n8:59 p.m. ET, November 14, 2019\nTrump employs his \"sir\" refrain tonight at rally in Louisiana\nFrom CNN's Daniel Dale\n\n\n\nPresident's Trump's long history of telling stories in which he has unnamed people referring to him as \"sir\" has been reported in the past and was a talking point once again tonight at a \"Keep America Great\" rally held in Louisiana.\n\nTrump told another \"sir\" story at the rally, saying Republicans are approaching him to urge him to prolong the impeachment saga because it is helping them politically.\n\nTrump's account of the supposed conversation: \"'Sir, our poll numbers are going through the roof, do you think we could keep this going?' I said, 'Do me a favor, let's get it ended.' They said, 'But let's keep it going, President, it's so great.'\"\n\nAs has been repeatedly documented, there is no sign of an impeachment spike in Trump's own approval numbers despite his claims otherwise.\n\n7:08 p.m. ET, November 14, 2019\nBudget official will testify in inquiry if subpoenaed, his lawyer says\nFrom CNN's Sara Murray\n\nMark Sandy, an official at the Office of Management and Budget, will testify in the House impeachment inquiry if he is subpoenaed, his lawyer said today.\n\nThe House Intelligence Committee scheduled a closed-door deposition for Sandy on Saturday.\n\n\u8942f he is subpoenaed, he will appear for the deposition,?his lawyer Barbara \u893aiz?Van Gelder said.\n\nVan Gelder said he has not received a subpoena yet. The common practice in these proceedings has been the House committees deliver the subpoena the morning of the day of scheduled testimony.\n\nThe Washington Post first reported.\n\n6:43 p.m. ET, November 14, 2019\nA diplomat who overheard a call between Trump and the EU ambassador is scheduled to testify tomorrow\nFrom CNN's Kylie Atwood and Nicole Gaouette\n\n Mark Makela/Getty Images\n Mark Makela/Getty Images\n\nA US diplomat who overheard President Trump ask the US Ambassador to the European Union about the status of \"investigations\" during a cellphone conversation in a Kiev restaurant is set to appear before the House impeachment inquiry behind closed doors tomorrow.\n\nDavid Holmes, the counselor for political affairs at the US Embassy in Ukraine, overheard the conversation between Trump and Gordon Sondland the day after Trump spoke with the Ukrainian president by phone in July, according to testimony Wednesday from Bill Taylor, the top US diplomat in the country.\n\nTaylor did not name Holmes, but sources tell CNN that he is the member of the embassy staff Taylor was referencing.\n\nWhat we know about Holmes: He is a career foreign service officer who arrived in Ukraine in 2017, according to a source who knows him and describes him as a \"sharp guy.\" He joined the foreign service in 2002, according to the American Foreign Service Association, and has previously served in Kabul, New Delhi, Kosovo, Bogota and Moscow.\n\nHolmes has also served as a special assistant for South and Central Asia to former Under Secretary of State for Political Affairs Bill Burns and spent time on the National Security Council staff at the White House as director for Afghanistan from 2011 to 2012.\n\n\"He is a decent guy and a smart, competent foreign service officer,\" said a second source who has worked on US policy in Ukraine and knows Holmes.\nAs political counselor, his main job is to determine what is going on in Ukrainian politics.\n\nHolmes often accompanied top US officials to meetings with Ukrainians as the note-taker in the last few years. It would not be unusual for him to accompany Sondland to these meetings, or for the two grab a meal in-between or after, the second source said.\n\n5:36 p.m. ET, November 14, 2019\nPodcast: In a political fight, the truth might be a sideshow\n\n\nIn today's episode of \"The Daily DC: Impeachment Watch\" podcast, CNN Political Director David Chalian looks at diplomat Bill Taylor's testimony and his new revelation alleging a direct link between President Trump and a Ukraine pressure campaign.\n\nChalian also covers:\n\nHow Trump and the GOP are dismissing the testimony as hearsay \nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi's comments that impeachment is about patriotism, not politics\nWhether a public testimony can cut through partisan media bubbles\nWhy Rudy Giuliani isn\u8ab8 nervous about the inquiry\nChalian is joined today by CNN White House reporter Stephen Collinson and CNN political commentator Matt Lewis.\n\nListen to the podcast here."

        "title": "Klobuchar: Woman with Buttigieg's record would miss debate",
        "text": "The 2020 Democratic presidential primary campaign drew a record six female candidates to the field. But with just less than three months until voting starts, only one has risen to the top tier.\n\nIs it sexism or just politics?\n\nThat's the debate that erupted Monday as one of those candidates, Sen. Amy Klobuchar, publicly complained about gender bias in the race, saying voters and the media were giving rival Pete Buttigieg, a small-town mayor, more support and attention because he's a man. A woman with a similar resume, Klobuchar argued, wouldn't be taken seriously enough to make the debate stage.\n\nThe comment seemed to touch a nerve in an election where gender politics is never far from the surface. Many in the party believe Hillary Clinton was a victim of sexism and voters who hold women to a different standard when she lost to Donald Trump in 2016. They're still hungry to elect the first female president and vigilantly working to combat signs of bias.\n\nStill, Klobuchar's comment was striking as it seemed aimed at a candidate also attempting to make history, by becoming the first openly gay president.\n\nThe three-term senator from Minnesota said Sunday on CNN's \"State of the Union\" that she believes Buttigieg, the 37-year-old mayor of South Bend, Indiana, is qualified but that she's the better candidate.\n\n\"I'm the one from the Midwest that has actually won in a statewide race over and over again,\" Klobuchar, 59, said, adding that she can bring in voters like those in Kentucky and Virginia who supported Democrats in last week's election. \"Those are the kind of voters I have won. And that's not true of Mayor Pete. That's just a fact.\"\n\nButtigieg has been one of the surprises of the Democratic presidential primary, rising from an unknown to a top candidate who has raised more money than almost all his rivals.\n\nHe is a Harvard graduate, Rhodes scholar and military veteran who is gay and married to his husband. He's won over voters who say that he's intelligent and that they appreciate his calm demeanor, his oratory skills and his message of generational change.\n\n\"I think, obviously, sexism is a force in politics. I also believe that I've gotten to where we've gotten to by having the right message, the right organization, reaching out to voters and convincing more and more of them to join this vision,\" Buttigieg said Monday. \"And if I can continue to do that, then we'll win, and if I can't, well, that's what we've got to do.\"\n\nKimberly Peeler-Allen, a visiting practitioner at the Center for American Women and Politics at Rutgers University and co-founder of Higher Heights, which supports black women in politics, said Klobuchar's comments were about more than Buttigieg.\n\nShe said there's an expectation of what people in leadership, particularly the presidency, should look like in this country, and pointed to female mayors of cities that are similarly sized to South Bend who likely wouldn't be taken seriously as presidential candidates. That's particularly true for black women, she said.\n\n\"It is more of a callout of the electorate and the powerbrokers and media and how they're covering people than on Mayor Pete himself,\" Peeler-Allen said.\n\nButtigieg's own sex could wind up hurting him if a man wins the nomination, she added, because a male Democratic nominee will almost certainly choose a woman, likely a woman of color, as a running mate.\n\nAfrican Americans and women make up the backbone of the Democratic Party, and a candidate can't win without a strong performance in both groups. There's a strong sense among party members that the Democratic ticket must include a representative of one or both groups.\n\nButtigieg also has faced bias over his sexual orientation, which some people see as a barrier to his being elected, particularly among African American voters, and he has encountered anti-gay protesters at stops on the campaign trail.\n\nKlobuchar has never lost a campaign, dating back to her bid to be the top prosecutor of Minnesota's largest county and her first Senate race in 2006, when she became the first woman elected to the U.S. Senate from Minnesota. She won her third term last year with 60% of the vote in Minnesota, which went for Clinton in 2016 but which Trump hopes to make a play for in 2020.\n\nButtigieg has run for statewide office once, in 2010, when he was the Democratic nominee for treasurer in the red state of Indiana. He lost to the Republican by more than 400,000 votes, winning about 38%.\n\nHe easily won his second term as mayor of South Bend, a community of about 100,000 people, with just over 8,500 ballots cast for him.\n\nButtigieg said performance in previous elections may not be the best test of a candidate's electability. Trump had never held public office before he won in 2016.\n\n\"If the measure of whether somebody can become president is how many votes they've gotten in previous elections, we wouldn't be here,\" Buttigieg said during a bus tour through New Hampshire.\n\nThe other female candidates who have met the Democratic National Committee qualifications for at least one debate are Sens. Elizabeth Warren and Kamala Harris, Rep. Tulsi Gabbard, author Marianne Williamson and Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, who dropped out of the race in August.\n\nAnother top candidate, former Vice President Joe Biden, also drew criticism for the way he described Warren's comments about critics of \"Medicare for All.\" Biden called it \"condescending\" and said she reflected an elitist and \"angry unyielding viewpoint.\"\n\nIn an email to supporters, Warren said women are told over and over that they're not allowed to be angry.\n\n\"It makes us unattractive to powerful men who want us to be quiet,\" she said. \"I'm angry and I own it.\"\n\nDuring the CNN interview, Klobuchar focused on the candidacies of Warren, Harris and herself.\n\n\"Do I think that we would be standing on that stage if we had the experience that (Buttigieg) had? No, I don't. Maybe we're held to a different standard.\"\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writers Hunter Woodall in Rochester, N.H., and Michelle R. Smith in Concord, N.H., contributed to this report."

        "title": "'I'm not going to contest these results,' Gov. Bevin says amid recanvass results, wishes Beshear 'well'",
        "text": "Current Kentucky Gov. Matt Bevin conceded the governor's race Thursday one week and two days after results showed him losing to Kentucky Attorney General Andy Beshear.\n\n\"I just want to be clear, we are going to have a change in the governorship based on the vote of the people, and what I want is to see the absolute best for Kentucky,\" outgoing Gov. Bevin said during a press conference to discuss the results of the recanvass he requested Nov. 6.\n\nCurrent Kentucky Attorney General, unofficial Democrat Governor-Elect Andy Beshear emerged from the Nov. 5 general election leading the Republican incumbent by a little more than 5,000 votes, a margin of less than 0.4 percentage points.\n\nThe recanvass began at county clerks offices at 9 a.m. Thursday across all 120 Kentucky counties.\n\nClick here to view the county-by-county results on the Secretary of State's website.\n\nThe Secretary of State's Office website showed the results compared to the original results and any differences in the two live as they came in.\n\nWith the exception of one county, which showed one vote difference from election night to Thursday's recanvass \u2014 one vote for Blackii Whyte (a real, independent, write-in candidate) \u2014 no results changed from Nov. 5.\n\n\"As expected it did not alter the outcome of the 2019 general election, as I predicted last week,\" current Kentucky Secretary of State Alison Lundergan Grimes said during a press conference of her own Thursday afternoon.\n\nShe says the results of the gubernatorial election will be certified Nov. 21 at 10 a.m.\n\n\"All of your county clerk's websites, it will say unofficial results until one, the contest period is over and second of all, once they've been accepted by the Secretary of State's Office, then they become official results,\" Kenton County Clerk of Courts, Gabrielle Summe, said.\n\nAs of 3 p.m., all 120 Kentucky counties had reported their recanvass numbers, 119 of them with no change. The only difference in original numbers to recanvass numbers was Casey County's new, lone vote for Whyte.\n\nOnce the majority of the recanvass results were in, Bevin announced he would not challenge them further.\n\n\"I'm not going to contest these numbers that have come in,\" he said. \"It isn't fair to throw that on our legislature to try to find something that there just isn't. We know of somethings but not enough to cause us to think there is going to be meaningful change.\n\n\"I want to be clear on a couple of things, had things gone down differently with different timing we could have made the same comments earlier,\" Bevin said. \"I truly wish the Attorney General (Beshear) well as the next governor of this state as he assumes these responsibilities. I truly do. I love this state, I love this country, I love the fact that we are blessed to live in a nation where things to transition in a way that much of the world wishes they had.\n\n\"There's not going to be people fighting in the streets. There's a natural exchange of leadership and we will have that. We have already been working \u2014 our team with his team \u2014 conversations have been had and will continue to be had. Expect to have a smooth transition.\"\n\nBevin even took time to touch on hot-button issues that arose during his time in the governor's office: like teacher pensions and rhetoric.\n\n\"I hope there's never a discussion again in the history of Kentucky over whether we should fund the pensions,\" the New Hampshire-native said. \"The pensions are still in dire, dire trouble and they need a tremendous amount of resources allocated to them and tremendous levels of attention paid to them as we move forward or they will fail and none of us want to see that happen. It's going to cost billions and billions every single year. I hope we don't go back to pretending it's not a problem.\"\n\nHis outgoing statements on teacher pensions come after Bevin vetoed pension reform bills and state budget bills that affected the state education system in April.\n\nREAD MORE | Kentucky educators call for action amid pension woes, budget veto\n\nBevin's issues with Kentucky teachers also reached a boiling point in April when he made controversial comments claiming that teachers who called in sick to protest the vetoed pension and budget put children's lives in danger.\n\nREAD MORE | Bevin: \u2018Not my intent to hurt anyone'; Teachers plan 'Black Out\"\n\n\"You know how many hundreds of thousands of children today were left home alone?\" Bevin asked in April. \"I guarantee you somewhere in Kentucky today a child was sexually assaulted that was left at home because there was nobody there to watch them.\"\n\nBevin continued on a positive note as he prepared to leave office Thursday, touching on rhetoric.\n\n\"I hope rhetoric gets checked and I hope people actually start to work collectively for the good of the people of Kentucky,\" Bevin said. \"One thing you will not see, I'm not going to be publicly undermining or second-guessing anything that is done. I'm sure there will be things I'm excited by and in complete agreement with and things I will be on the other side of the equation with and this is the way things are.\"\n\nBevin was often accused of having a negative rhetoric as he sparred with his opponents throughout his one term in office.\n\nHe wished incoming governor Andy Beshear well multiple times Thursday saying, \"again, I want to wish Attorney General Beshear well as he transitions to his next role in this state. It's a big responsibility.\"\n\nThough Bevin insisted this was the end of the road for his fight to stay in office, Nov. 6 when announcing his recanvass request Bevin said he believed voter fraud was an issue that led to his loss.\n\n\"There's a history of voter fraud in our state. We know there have been thousands of absentee ballots that have been illegally counted, reports of people incorrectly turned away,\" he said.\n\nREAD MORE | Gov. Matt Bevin says KY has \u2018history of voter fraud,' asks for recanvass of vote totals | NKU professor: Bevin \u2018has nobody but himself to blame'\n\nLundergan Grimes said neither she nor her office has been informed of any fraud or any suspicious activity at any polling location.\n\nThe Secretary of State's Office says Kentucky law doesn't allow for a recount in a gubernatorial general election, but says there is no threshold or margin requirement for a recanvass.\n\nThe Secretary of State's Office released a statement explaining the recanvass and how it works:\n\n\"A recanvass is a reprint of the receipts from voting machines to check for reporting or clerical errors. After ballots are scanned, the machine tabulates those votes and prints out a receipt with the total.\n\nDuring a recanvass, those receipts will be reprinted and checked again to make sure they were reported properly. It's not uncommon for some clerical errors to occur during the initial vote tabulation.\n\nAll 120 counties would then fill out and submit the same certification forms again with the recanvass results.\n\nWhat happens after the recanvass?\n\nOnce the recanvass is complete, the state board of elections has until Nov. 25 to certify the election results.\n\nA candidate can contest the results only after the election board has completed certification.\n\nShould a candidate pursue a contest after certification, they must file a written notice citing specific grounds for the contest within 30 days of the election board's final action.\n\nOnce that notice is given, the Kentucky General Assembly would then be authorized to constitute a board to review the evidence and hear depositions. This board must consist of three state senators and eight state House representatives.\n\nBoard members are chosen by lottery \u2014 names are written on separate slips of paper and drawn at random. The board is then tasked with reviewing the evidence and discussing the allegations. Afterward, the board would file a recommendation to the full General Assembly for further action if necessary, which could include a vote.\n\nRepublicans control both chambers of the General Assembly \u2014 61-39 in the House, including two special election contests the GOP won last night, and 29-9 in the Senate.\"\n\nBeshear unveiled a website Tuesday for the transition, and people can go there to apply to work in the administration.\n\nHe announced Deputy Attorney General J. Michael Brown would lead the transition team last week.\n\nBeshear and his Lt. Gov. Jacqueline Coleman held a press conference Thursday at 3:30 p.m. where they discussed their excitement to move forward in their new roles. Beshear said he had been in contact with Bevin's office to discuss the transition. He also says he is beginning to gather plans for getting the state's new budget together.\n\nThe Republican Party of Kentucky Chairman Mac Brown released a statement about Thursday's recanvass:\n\n\"Kentuckians can be proud of all Gov. Matt Bevin accomplished for our state in bringing jobs and opportunity to Kentucky in record-breaking fashion. Thanks to Gov. Matt Bevin's leadership, Kentucky's future is brighter than ever before. On behalf of the Republican Party of Kentucky, I'd like to personally thank Gov. Bevin for all he has done to make Kentucky a better place.\n\n\"Kentucky Republicans are also justly proud of all that our candidates accomplished in this year's elections. With our historic victories of 2019, for the first time in decades, Republicans will hold the offices of agriculture commissioner, attorney general, auditor, secretary of state and treasurer simultaneously. We're excited to carry this momentum into 2020 as we work to grow our legislative supermajorities and reelect Senator McConnell and President Trump in 2020.\"\n\n\u2013 Republican Party of Kentucky Chairman Mac Brown"

        "text": "Congressional Democrats and Republicans each appear to face a challenge moving public opinion on impeachment as public hearings begin, since many Americans say their views are already locked in. There's been essentially no change in the number who feel President Trump deserves to be impeached since last month, and now the public expresses dissatisfaction with the approaches of both congressional Democrats and the president thus far.\n\nMore Americans feel the Democrats have done a bad job handling the inquiry (52%) than a good job (48%.) And more feel President Trump has done a bad job handling it (56%) than feel he has handled it well (43%.)\n\nAmericans favor making at least some hearings public. A large majority think testimony should either be in open hearings (47%) or a mix of open and closed, depending on the sensitivity of the testimony (42%). Just 11% say hearings should be closed. More than half of Americans continue to approve of congressional Democrats having started the impeachment inquiry.\n\nEight in 10 Americans have an opinion on whether the president deserves to be impeached, and are divided today much as they have been for weeks, with 43% saying he does and 40% saying he does not. Seventeen percent say it is too soon to say, but many of them are also not paying as much attention. \n\nOf those who do have an opinion on the matter, most say their minds are made up about it: nearly 3 in 4 say so. \n\nViews on the whistleblower are mixed and marked by sharp partisan divides just like other aspects of the matter. Eighty percent of Democrats feel any whistleblower's identity ought to remain private, while 76% of Republicans say their identity should be forced to be made public.\n\nPartisans divide on what they believe is the motivation behind the whistleblower's complaint as well. Most Republicans think the whistleblower's motivation was probably to politically damage Mr. Trump. Democrats tend to feel the whistleblower was probably trying to protect the interests of the United States.\n\nThe audience for the live hearings may be less receptive to persuasion than the larger public. Fewer than half of Americans say they plan to watch even parts of the hearings live; partisans are more likely than independents to say they will; and those who say they could still change their minds about impeachment are less likely to say they'll watch live than those whose minds are already made up.\n\n\nOne in five Americans say they think the events surrounding impeachment have been very easy to follow so far. More ?37% ?say the events are somewhat easy to follow.\n\nOn the GOP side, roughly 7 in 10 rank-and-file Republicans think congressional Republicans should defend Mr. Trump on his handling of Ukraine, while a quarter think those representatives should wait to see more of the facts before deciding. But a mere 6% feel they should criticize the president. And on the Democratic side, only 11% call the impeachment matter a political distraction.

Forty-six percent say he is doing a good job, while 54% think he is doing a bad job ?the same as in July, before the beginning of the impeachment inquiry.\n\nSeven in 10 Americans are paying at least some attention to the impeachment inquiry. As was the case last month, Democrats are paying more attention than either Republicans or independents.\n\nThe CBS News survey is conducted by YouGov using a nationally representative sample of 3,380 U.S. residents interviewed online between November 9-11, 2019.

        "text": "President Donald Trump knew where to go Saturday for home field advantage, finding comfort in the Deep South with college football fans cheering the nation's top two teams \u2014 and him.\n\nHis reception at the showdown between Louisiana State and Alabama contrasted with the scene at Game 5 of the World Series in Washington, where was booed, and the mixed response to his appearance at a martial arts fight in New York.\n\nTrump, sitting one tier above the field, waved as fans turned around to look up at the president. He smiled, gave a thumbs-up a few times and threw a couple of fist bumps into the air as the Alabama fans waved red and white pompoms in response. First lady Melania Trump got an equally enthusiastic welcome.\n\nThere was little sign of political sentiment on campus but plenty of bipartisan grumbling about the long lines to get in due to enhanced security. Trump left in the fourth quarter of the game, which LSU won 46-41.\n\nThe inflatable figure depicting a baby Donald Trump wearing a diaper, which has been seen at protests around the world, made an appearance in Tuscaloosa. The organizer of the group that \"adopted\" the balloon for the event told police a man with a knife cut an 8-foot-long gash in its back, deflating it. Tuscaloosa police said in a statement that a 32-year-old local man was charged with criminal mischief in the incident.\n\nA protester carried a sign that said \"Roll Tide Impeach 45\" and another held a sign saying she had sold her ticket and donated the money to the Alabama Democratic Party.\n\nBut there were more pro-Trump signs. One woman wore an oversized red MAGA hat and carried a sign saying: \"Make BAMA #1 Again.\" There were flags emblazoned with \"Trump 2020\u2033 and banners that read: \"Keep America Great Trump 2020.\"\n\nPresidents have long used sporting events to woo support, but these events also are a venue for fans to express their own political leanings.\n\nBoth loud boos and cheers could be heard as Trump took his seat before the recent pay-per-view UFC title match. That greeting was warmer than the reception Trump received at the World Series at Nationals Park, when he was roundly booed and became the target of a \"Lock him up!\" chant.\n\nHe knew he was heading to friendlier turf in Alabama, getting out of Washington where talk of impeachment was everywhere.\n\nOn the flight to Tuscaloosa, Trump tweeted jabs at House Democrats, who launched the impeachment inquiry.\n\nOn the tarmac before boarding Air Force One, he told reporters: \"It's a witch hunt and it should never happen to another president.\"\n\nIn Alabama, where he won 63% of the vote in 2016, the president generated some heat. Alabama's student government association warned students against being disruptive, but said their First Amendment rights will not being muzzled.\n\n\"Regardless of your political views, that's pretty cool, having the president at the game,\" said LSU quarterback Joe Burrow.\n\nAlabama wide receiver Henry Ruggs III said, \"Just for him even wanting to come to this game, it just shows, like I said, the magnitude of the game.\"\n\nFor Trump, the game is both football and politics.\n\nTrump has been enthusiastically supporting Republican businessman Eddie Rispone's effort to unseat Louisiana's incumbent Democratic Gov. John Bel Edwards in the last governor's race of the year. The runoff election in Louisiana offers Trump an opportunity to pick up a win in a rare Democratic-held governor's seat in the Deep South. He attended a rally in Monroe, Louisiana, on Wednesday and he'll be back in the state this coming week, two days before Louisiana voters have their say.\n\nThe game came two days after Trump's former attorney general, Jeff Sessions, announced he is going to run again for his old Senate seat from Alabama. Sessions was the first senator to back Trump's upstart campaign and worked to champion conservative causes as attorney general, but the president has never forgiven Sessions for withdrawing from overseeing the Russia investigation led by former special counsel Robert Mueller.\n\nTrump said Friday he won't campaign against Sessions.\n\nAt the game, Trump sat in a box owned by Jim Wilson, a real estate businessman from Alabama. The president was joined by Louisiana Republican Reps. Clay Higgins, Mike Johnson, Ralph Abraham and Garret Graves; Sen. Richard Shelby, R-Ala., and Alabama Republican Reps. Robert Aderholt, Bradley Byrne and Gary Palmer.\n\nTrump follows a long line of presidents who have attended college football games:\n\n\u2014President William Howard Taft attended the LSU-Sewanee game in October 1909 in New Orleans.\n\n\u2014President John F. Kennedy went to the Alabama-Oklahoma game on New Year's Day in 1963 in Miami.\n\n\u2014In December 1969, President Richard Nixon was at Razorback Stadium in Fayetteville, Arkansas, to watch Texas play Arkansas.\n\n\u2014President Bill Clinton watched Arkansas play Louisiana Tech in September 1997 at War Memorial Stadium in Little Rock, Arkansas."

Tobacco companies such as Phillip Morris MO.N and RJ Reynolds also provided the limited-government group with financial support.\n\n\"My plan would require industry actors who submit non-peer-reviewed research to agencies to disclose how that research was funded, whether those funders influenced the research's findings, and the nature of any past or ongoing financial relationships,\" Warren wrote.\n\nSilvestri said Exxon's research had resulted in nearly 150 public papers, including more than 50 in peer-reviewed publications.\n\nWarren cited recent congressional testimony by a former Exxon consultant that the company knew of serious risks posed by climate change in the early 1980s. In 2009, a group of industry groups that included Exxon filed a regulatory comment with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency that stated the effects of climate change were \"almost non-existent and engulfed in an extremely high degree of uncertainty.\"\n\nRex Tillerson, Exxon's chief executive from 2006 to 2017, served as Trump's secretary of state from February 2017 to March 2018.\n\nExxon is currently awaiting a verdict in a New York case that accuses the company of misleading investors about the impact of climate change-related regulations on its business.

        "text": "Former Massachusetts Gov. Deval Patrick has told allies he will join the 2020 presidential race, according to two people familiar with his plans. An official announcement is expected before Friday, the filing deadline for the New Hampshire primary.\n\nPatrick's move injects a new layer of uncertainty into the contest less than three months before the first votes. A popular two-term Democratic governor with a moderate bearing and close ties to former President Barack Obama, he is starting late but with a compelling life story and political resume.\n\nThe two people with knowledge of Patrick's plans spoke to The Associated Press on Wednesday on condition of anonymity to discuss private conversations.\n\nIn addition to Patrick, Michael Bloomberg, the billionaire former mayor of New York City, has taken steps toward launching a last-minute presidential campaign, filing candidate papers in Alabama and Arkansas. Even 2016 nominee Hillary Clinton this week said in a BBC interview that she is \"under enormous pressure from many, many, many people to think about it,\" adding that she has no such plans but still would \"never, never, never say never.\"\n\nThe moves reflect uncertainty about the direction of the Democratic contest with no commanding front-runner. Joe Biden entered the race as the presumptive favorite and maintains significant support from white moderates and black voters, whose backing is critical in a Democratic primary. But he's facing spirited challenges from Patrick's home-state senator, Elizabeth Warren, and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, progressives whose calls for fundamental economic change have alarmed moderates and wealthy donors.\n\nFind out what's happening in Bostonwith free, real-time updates from Patch.\nPatrick could present himself as a potential bridge across the moderate, liberal and progressive factions - as candidates like Mayor Pete Buttigieg, Sen. Kamala Harris and Sen. Cory Booker are trying to do.\n\nBut the former governor faces significant hurdles to raise enormous amounts of money quickly and to build an organization in the traditional early voting states that most of his rivals have focused on for the past year. And he'll have to pivot to the expensive and logistically daunting Super Tuesday contests, when voters in more than a dozen states and territories head to the polls. Bloomberg's team has said they will skip the early states of Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada and South Carolina to focus on the Super Tuesday roster.\n\nIt's also a near certainty that Patrick - and possibly Bloomberg - wouldn't make a Democratic debate stage until January, if at all, because of debate rules set by the party.\n\nThose dynamics left some prominent Democrats questioning Patrick's viability, while some existing campaigns privately offered outright mockery and derision.\n\n\"Stop. We have enough candidates,\" said Kathy Sullivan, a Democratic National Committee member from New Hampshire, which hosts the party's first presidential primary following the Iowa caucuses.\n\nTexas Democratic Chairman Gilberto Hinojosa, whose state boasts the second-largest number of Super Tuesday delegates behind California, said he hadn't heard from Patrick or his representatives. \"People are fine with the field,\" Hinojosa said, arguing that donors and media are mistaken to think that rank-and-file Democrats see Biden, Warren and others as unable to take down President Donald Trump.\n\nBesides, Hinojosa said, \"most of the people you need to build out a campaign have already chosen sides.\"\n\nA former managing director for Bain Capital, Patrick has close ties to Wall Street donors. As the first black governor of Massachusetts and only the nation's second elected black governor since Reconstruction, Patrick also could run as a historic boundary breaker trying to dent Biden's support among African Americans - though Harris and Booker, the only two black Democrats in the Senate, have been unable to do that thus far.\n\nA Biden aide confirmed that Patrick had talked to Biden in recent days about the possibility of entering the race, though it wasn't clear Wednesday whether the two men had talked since Patrick had decided that he would run. A Booker aide said Wednesday that Patrick had not called the New Jersey senator.\n\nPatrick has remained active in politics since his term as governor ended in 2015.\n\nDuring the 2018 midterm elections, he traveled across the country in support of Democratic candidates, raising his national profile. \"He's a dynamic speaker,\" Hinojosa said, recalling Patrick headlining a Texas Democratic fundraiser ahead of the midterms. \"But that's the last we've heard from him.\"\n\nPatrick also campaigned for Doug Jones during Alabama's contentious 2017 special election for U.S. Senate.\n\nLast year, some of Patrick's supporters and close advisers launched the Reason to Believe political action committee, \"a grassroots organization dedicated to advancing a positive, progressive vision for our nation in 2018 and 2020.\" The PAC held meetups across the country, including in early presidential primary states.\n\nBy December, however, Patrick cooled to the idea of a presidential bid.\n\n\"After a lot of conversation, reflection and prayer, I've decided that a 2020 campaign for president is not for me,\" Patrick posted on his Facebook page at the time. Patrick said he and his wife worried that the \"cruelty of our elections process would ultimately splash back on people whom Diane and I love, but who hadn't signed up for the journey.\"\n\nThe PAC was formally dissolved earlier this year.\n\nPatrick, a close friend of Obama's who campaigned for him, has positioned himself over the years as slightly more moderate than some on the Democratic left.\n\nAfter Trump's election, Patrick's initial criticism of the Republican president was somewhat less pointed than other Democrats offered. \"We need our presidents to succeed,\" he said, while still expressing concern about what he described as Trump's belittling of those with opposing points of view.\n\nPatrick also urged the party at the time to look in the mirror, saying that \"the outcome of the 2016 election was less about Donald Trump winning than Democrats and our nominee letting him do so.\"\n\nEarly in his career, Patrick served as assistant attorney general for civil rights in the Clinton administration and later worked as an executive at Texaco and Coca-Cola. Since leaving the governor's office, Patrick has worked as a managing director for Bain Capital - a company co-founded by 2012 Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney, Patrick's predecessor as governor.\n\nPatrick's Massachusetts record is mixed. His successes include helping oversee the 2006 health care law signed by Romney that would go on to serve as a blueprint for Obama's 2010 health care law.\n\nAlso considered a success: a 2008 initiative that committed Massachusetts to spending $1 billion over 10 years to jump-start the state's life sciences sector.\n\nThere were rough patches, including turmoil at the state Department of Children and Families following the deaths of three children.\n\nPatrick was also forced to publicly apologize for a disastrous effort to transition to the federal health care law during which the state's website performed so poorly it created a backlog of more than 50,000 paper applications."

I will certainly tell you, I'm under enormous pressure from many, many, many people to think about it. But as of this moment, sitting here in this studio talking to you, that is absolutely not my plans,\" Clinton said.\n\nClinton said she often thinks about \"what kind of president\" she would have been.\n\n\"I feel a sense of responsibility partly because, you know, my name was on the ballot. I got more votes, but ended up losing to the current incumbent in the White House, who I think is really undermining our democracy in very fundamental ways,\" Clinton said. \"And I want to retire him. I want him to be retired.\"\n\nClinton has largely ruled out a run in 2020, but has remained in the public eye as she promotes her new book, \"The Book of Gusty Women,\" which she co-authored with her daughter.

She hasn't promised to give illegal immigrants free health care. She hasn\u8ab8 promised to decriminalize illegal entry into the country. I don't think she supports the Green New Deal or Medicare for All. In that regard, it would be more difficult for the Republicans to have somebody not as wacky.\"\n\nClinton said Tuesday she thinks it is \"inexplicable and shameful\" that the British government won't publicly release a report on Russian interference in their elections.\n\n\"I'm saying that Russia played in your Brexit election, just like Russia played in our 2016 election. Who did what, what they knew, where the money went, where it came from, what it influenced, that is something that should be investigated and revealed to the British public. Just like it should have been before our election.\"\n\n\"I'm dumbfounded that this government won't release the report ... because every person who votes in this country deserves to see that report before your election happens,\" Clinton said. \"There is no doubt ... that Russia in particular is determined to try to shape the politics of Western democracies, not to our benefit but to theirs.\"\n\nA Senate Intelligence Committee report did find that there was Russian interference, often in the form of bot activity, in the 2016 presidential election."

        "text": "As the impeachment inquiry against President Trump moves into a public phase this week, leading Democrats \u2014 joined by at least one GOP lawmaker \u2014 on Sunday rejected Republican demands for public testimony by the whistleblower whose complaint set the process in motion.\nRep. Will Hurd of Texas, who has broken with the White House on other issues, said Sunday the whistleblower should not have been included on a list of witnesses the Republicans wanted to testify in open hearings set to begin Wednesday.\n\nThe person's confidential complaint, formally filed in August, voiced alarm about Trump pressuring Ukraine to dig up dirt on Democrats, including former Vice President Joe Biden, a leading 2020 Democratic presidential contender, and his son Hunter. There has been no evidence of wrongdoing by the Bidens in Ukraine.\n\nDemocrats in late September convened an impeachment inquiry centering on whether Trump abused his power by withholding $400 million in crucial aid to Ukraine, a vulnerable ally, in order to advance his own political agenda. The president also pressed Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate baseless claims that Ukraine interfered in the 2016 U.S. presidential election.\n\nThe scattered and sometimes contradictory White House response to the allegations made by a parade of impeachment witnesses who have testified behind closed doors over the past several weeks were reflected in appearances by several senior Republican lawmakers on Sunday's news-talk shows.\n\nThey variously declared that Trump's conduct might have been questionable but was not impeachable, or that testimony by former and current administration officials represented a misreading of Trump's intent in his dealings with Ukraine's president. Or they simply asserted that the president did nothing wrong.\n\nIn advance of the public hearings, Rep. Adam Schiff (D-Burbank), who is spearheading the impeachment inquiry, has not yet finalized the witness list. But in a letter sent Saturday to Rep. Devin Nunes (R-Tulare), the ranking Republican on the House Intelligence Committee, Schiff said there would be no facilitating of efforts to \"threaten, intimidate and retaliate against the whistleblower who courageously raised the initial alarm.\"\n\nHurd, a former CIA officer who also sits on the Intelligence Committee, defended the unidentified individual's right to privacy, citing laws shielding those who seek to expose fraud, abuse and wrongdoing in government. \"We should be protecting the identity of the whistleblower,\" he told \"Fox News Sunday.\"\n\nHurd, who is not running for reelection, is unusual in risking Trump's ire by publicly supporting protections for the whistleblower. But the overall White House impeachment-defense strategy, which has included a furious personal focus by Trump on the individual behind the complaint, has prompted some unease in Republican ranks.\n\nAt campaign-style rallies, including one in Louisiana last week, Trump has again and again called for publication of the whistleblower's identity, drawing sharp objections from the individual's legal team. Right-wing media outlets have circulated the person's purported name, and Trump's son Donald Jr. last week tweeted out a Breitbart article that included it.\n\nAlthough Trump consistently tells rally crowds that the whistleblower's account has been shown to be false, closed-door testimony by current and former administration officials has in fact corroborated core elements of the complaint, which centered on Trump's efforts to pressure Zelensky to investigate the 2016 election as well as Biden's son Hunter, who formerly sat on the board of directors of a Ukrainian energy company.\n\nDemocrats say the whistleblower's complaint is no longer relevant because Trump has acknowledged that he made the request, even as he was withholding the aid, though he has said the two things were not related. A rough White House transcript of the telephone call between the leaders described Trump as asking Zelensky for a \"favor\" \u2014 to open the investigations. U.S. diplomats have since described the demand as a quid pro quo in which a foreign government was pressured to get involved in the 2020 election for the personal benefit of Trump.\n\nWhile continuing to attack the inquiry process as tainted, Republicans signaled with Saturday's proposed witness list that they intended to try to turn the spotlight away from accusations that the president abused his power for political ends and instead would seek to discredit U.S. intelligence findings, reaffirmed by special counsel Robert S. Mueller III, that Russia interfered with the 2016 election with the aim of aiding Trump.\n\nOther Republicans steered clear of the substance of allegations or questioned their significance. On ABC's \"This Week,\" Rep. Mac Thornberry (R-Texas), said that although Trump's behavior might have been inappropriate, \"I do not believe it was impeachable.\"\n\nSen. Rand Paul of Kentucky, one of Trump's staunchest allies, said on NBC's \"Meet the Press\" that there was ample precedent for successive presidents using aid as an incentive or deterrent for certain behavior by foreign governments.\n\n\"I think we've gotten lost in this whole idea of quid pro quo,\" Paul said, using the Latin phrase meaning \"something for something,\" which describes a service or favor being expected in return for one provided. \"Presidents have withheld aid before because of corruption.\" Trump has said he withheld the $400 million in aid to Ukraine because he was concerned the government was not doing enough to fight corruption.\n\nDemocrats contend that for the president and his allies, expressing worry about corruption was code for pressuring authorities in Kyiv to procure information that could be damaging to the Bidens and Democrats. That, witness testimony by diplomats and national-security officials has suggested, was part of a shadow foreign policy carried out by Trump's lawyer Rudy Giuliani, with the aid of figures such as EU ambassador Gordon Sondland, who relayed the president's demands to Ukraine.\n\nAnother GOP senator, Ron Johnson of Wisconsin, said on CNN's \"State of the Union\" that officials' closed-door testimony offered so far did not establish that Trump's motive in pressuring Zelensky was personal political gain.\n\n\"That's their impression,\" Johnson said of the officials who painted a picture of Trump improperly pressing Zelensky to go after the Bidens. \"I never heard the president say, \u2018I want to dig up dirt on a 2020 opponent.' \"\n\nThe requested-witness list also reflected Republicans' desire to spotlight Hunter Biden, who was paid $50,000 a month for his work for Burisma, a Ukrainian gas company, while his father was vice president. Ukrainian officials say Hunter Biden is not suspected of any wrongdoing.\n\nWhile breaking ranks with fellow Republicans over the call for the whistleblower's testimony, Hurd said in his \"Fox News Sunday\" interview that he agreed the younger Biden should be called to appear.\n\nOne Democratic member of the House Intelligence Committee, also interviewed on Fox, suggested that the main consideration in summoning witnesses should be whether they had \"knowledge or evidence about the president's conduct\" in regard to Ukraine. Rep. Sean Patrick Maloney of New York said he couldn't speak for Schiff but that figures like Hunter Biden and the whistleblower would not fall into that category.\n\nNor, Maloney said, would Nellie Ohr, a contractor with Fusion GPS, a research firm that hired former British intelligence official Christopher Steele to investigate allegations about ties between Russia and Trump's 2016 campaign. She is also on the Republicans' list of requested witnesses in the impeachment inquiry."

Deval Patrick is considering making a late run for the Democratic presidential nomination, according to two people with knowledge of his deliberations, underscoring some Democrats' deep uncertainty about the party's current crop of contenders.\n\nPatrick, a close friend and ally of former President Barack Obama, ruled out a presidential bid earlier this year but has since been talking with Democratic operatives and donors about launching a campaign. He has not made a final decision on whether to run, but he is expected to do so quickly, given fast-approaching deadlines to get on the ballot in key states.\n\nPatrick is the second Democrat to weigh jumping into the race at this late juncture, less than three months before the kickoff Iowa caucuses. Former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg is also reconsidering a run, citing concerns about the current Democratic front-runners' ability to defeat President Donald Trump. Bloomberg is expected to make a final decision on his 2020 prospects within days.\n\nThe people with knowledge of Patrick's deliberations spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the matter publicly.\n\nDemocrats plunged into the 2020 race with sky high enthusiasm about the prospects of defeating Trump and with a historic number of candidates vying for the nomination. But as the field has started to dwindle, some in the party have raised concerns about the durability of former Vice President Joe Biden and the ability of liberal Sens. Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders to win in a general election.\n\nAlthough Patrick ruled out a run late last year, he reopened conversations with close friends and aides over the summer but did not take active steps to form a campaign. In recent days, those conversations have intensified, with Patrick gauging interest in a run with donors and Democratic operatives.\n\nHe would face big hurdles to launching a campaign at this late stage. Unlike Bloomberg, a wealthy billionaire who would self-fund, Patrick would have to quickly raise money to build out a campaign operation and boost his familiarity with voters. Some of his former political advisers are already working for other 2020 candidates, including his former chief of staff Doug Rubin, who is working for Tom Steyer.\n\nPatrick, who made history as Massachusetts' first black governor, could gain traction in neighboring New Hampshire, which holds the first primary contest. However, he'd face stiff competition there from two other neighboring state candidates: Warren of Massachusetts and Sanders of Vermont.\n\nNew Hampshire's primary filing deadline is Friday.\n\nBloomberg plans to skip the early states, where candidates have camped out for months courting voters and building operations. Instead, he's said he would focus on the crush of states that vote on March 3 \u2014 dubbed Super Tuesday \u2014 and beyond, where more delegates are at stake.\n\nWhen Patrick decided last year not to run, he cited what he called the \"cruelty\" of the election process.\n\n\"After a lot of conversation, reflection and prayer, I've decided that a 2020 campaign for president is not for me,\" Patrick had posted on his Facebook page. Patrick said he and his wife worried that the \"cruelty of our elections process would ultimately splash back on people whom Diane and I love, but who hadn't signed up for the journey.\"\n\nPatrick has tried to position himself as more moderate than his party's left flank and could compete for votes with Biden, who is running as a centrist.\n\nEarly in his career, Patrick served as assistant attorney general for civil rights in the Clinton administration and later worked as an executive at Texaco and Coca-Cola. Since leaving the governor's office, Patrick has worked as a managing director for Bain Capital \u2014 a company co-founded by Mitt Romney and widely criticized by Democrats during Romney's 2012 Republican presidential campaign.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writers Brian Slodysko in Washington and Steve LeBlanc in Boston contributed to this report."

Despite that, he said, \"Having said that, I think that William Taylor was a very impressive witness and was very damaging to the president. First of all, as you pointed out, he took very copious notes at almost every conversation ?when he put quotes in his opening statement, he said those were direct quotes from what was said. It also doesn\u8ab8 hurt that he has a voice like Edward R. Murrow.\"\n\nHe added, \"He is a pretty impressive presence up there. And, I think, very nonpolitical. He went out of his way to talk about what he knew, what he was specifically testament to.

But he certainly wasn\u8ab8 taking any partisan position.\"\n\nLater, network commentator Juan Williams called Taylor's testimony \"a very strong presentation\" and added that \"it was pretty powerful.\""

        "title": "AP FACT CHECK: Trump assails a process he swore to uphold",
        "text": "President Donald Trump and his allies are crying foul over an impeachment process firmly rooted in the Constitution they swore to uphold.\n\nTrump is also assailing the lawyer for the whistleblower at the heart of the impeachment inquiry. He accurately noted the attorney's expressions of hostility to his presidency while overlooking how the lawyer was a thorn in Hillary Clinton's side, too.\n\nA look at recent comments:\n\nTRUMP: \"It was just explained to me that for next weeks Fake Hearing (trial) in the House, as they interview Never Trumpers and others, I get NO LAWYER & NO DUE PROCESS.\" \u2014 tweet Thursday.\n\nTHE FACTS: The hearing is a hearing, not a trial, and it is unfolding according to the usual process.\n\nTrump is correct that he and his legal team are excluded from public hearings that begin next week, but he hasn't been charged with anything and has no constitutional right to be represented by a lawyer in this proceeding.\n\nIn that sense, his position is not much different from criminal suspects who are being investigated but haven't been charged, or from past presidents at this stage of impeachment proceedings.\n\nThe coming public hearings led by the House intelligence committee, like the ongoing closed-door proceedings, are more akin to the investigative phase of criminal cases, generally conducted in private and without the participation of the person under investigation.\n\nBut the House also has laid out procedures that do give Trump and his lawyers some rights in future House Judiciary Committee hearings that presumably would result in the drafting of impeachment articles.\n\nIn Judiciary hearings, both open and closed, Trump would be invited to attend and his lawyers could question witnesses and object to testimony and evidence, similar to the process in the Richard Nixon and Bill Clinton impeachment inquiries.\n\nThe House could cut back on the lawyers' participation if the White House refuses to provide documents or allow witnesses to testify.\n\nIf there is a Senate trial, Trump's legal team would defend the president against impeachment articles approved by the House in an environment that would look like a typical trial in some respects.\n\nThe ability to call witnesses, though, would be up to the Senate and, presumably, the subject of private negotiations between the Republicans who control that chamber and the Democratic minority.\n\n___\n\nSEN. RAND PAUL: \"Enshrined in the 6th Amendment is the right to confront your accuser.\" \u2014 tweet Tuesday.\n\nSEN. LINDSEY GRAHAM, chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee: \"We're not going to try the president of the United States based on hearsay. Every American has a right to confront their accuser.\" \u2014 interview on Sept. 29 on CBS' \"Face the Nation.\"\n\nTHE FACTS: Graham and Paul are omitting key words from the start of the Sixth Amendment: \"In all criminal prosecutions.\"\n\nTrump is not facing an accuser in a criminal proceeding. The hearings are a political proceeding.\n\nMoreover, the whistleblower's account has been substantiated by multiple on-the-record accounts of government officials and the rough transcript of Trump's phone call with Ukraine's president that the White House released.\n\nPaul, Graham and Trump himself are interested in unmasking the identity of the whistleblower at the heart of the impeachment inquiry. His or her identity is protected under federal whistleblower law.\n\nThe comments by Trump, Graham and Paul invoke various notions of fairness enshrined in the Constitution. Trump's reference to due process comes from the Fifth and 14th amendments, which hold that before people can be deprived of life, liberty or property, they must get a fair shake, or due process of law.\n\nThe Sixth Amendment guarantees a lawyer for criminal defendants and the right to confront their accusers. As it happens, the impeachment process also is outlined in the Constitution and it gives the House of Representatives the sole power to impeach and the Senate the sole power to remove an official, including the president, from office.\n\nIn general terms, impeachment by the House is akin to an indictment and trial by the Senate resembles a criminal prosecution. The hearings might or might not lead to those two stages.\n\n___\n\nWHITE HOUSE: \"Before there was a whistleblower, there was the whistleblower's attorney_tweeting about overthrowing the government because he didn't like the election results.\" \u2014 tweet Thursday.\n\nTRUMP: \"Coup has started, whistleblower's attorney said in 2017. Do you know when that was? That was a long time ago. It's all a hoax. They say January 2017 a coup has started, and the impeachment will follow ultimately. It's all \u2014 it's all a hoax.\" \u2014 Louisiana rally on Wednesday.\n\nTHE FACTS: Trump and his team can't be faulted for believing that Mark Zaid, one of the whistleblower's attorneys, has it out for the president.\n\nThat does not mean Zaid can be dismissed as a Democratic partisan, either.\n\nThe longtime Washington lawyer has represented people in both parties, causes dear to each side and a line of whistleblowers.\n\nTrump and his team are pointing to a January 2017 tweet by Zaid, who says he's a registered independent, in which he writes \"#coup has started. First of many steps. #rebellion. #impeachment will follow ultimately.\"\n\nThe hyperbolic tweet was in response to news that Trump had fired acting Attorney General Sally Yates after she refused to enforce a ban on travel for people living in several predominantly Muslim countries.\n\nUnder ethics rules, attorneys are charged with representing a client responsibly regardless of their personal views. The whistleblower is also represented by Andrew Bakaj, a former CIA intelligence officer.\n\nSome of Zaid's legal work over the years has involved issues close to Trump, such as his cases challenging Clinton's use of a private email server.\n\nZaid represented a veteran's group in a lawsuit against the State Department that sought records of Clinton's response to the Benghazi attacks as secretary of state. The suit targeted Clinton's reliance on the private server for government communication, saying \"it may have been a deliberate attempt to shield communications from capture by governmental systems and the public's eye, for reasons yet unknown.\"\n\nHe also represented CIA contractors who were in Benghazi on the night of the attacks.\n\nZaid served as an attorney for former Republican North Carolina Rep. Walter Jones and The Daily Caller, a conservative publication, in public records lawsuits against the federal government.\n\nZaid now says his reference to a \"coup\" referred to those working in the Trump administration who were standing up to the president to help enforce the rule of law."

        "text": "On Veterans Day, President Donald Trump paid tribute to America's troops at a New York City parade as top 2020 Democratic candidates outlined their plans for the Department of Veterans Affairs, such as naming a woman to run the agency for the first time.\n\nThe Democratic proposals, coming two days before historic impeachment hearings, sought to highlight policy differences with the embattled president before a key bloc of voters.\n\n\"The president has let veterans down,\" said Democrat Pete Buttigieg, the 37-year-old mayor of South Bend, Indiana.\n\nA former Navy intelligence officer, Buttigieg said female veterans and service members in particular have been neglected, including on concerns about sexual harassment and women's health. Women are the military's fastest-growing subgroup.\n\n\"I think leadership plays a huge role so absolutely I'd seek to name a woman to lead VA,\" he said.\n\nTrump was the first sitting president to attend New York's veterans parade, viewing veterans as standing among his biggest supporters. Past presidents have typically spent Veterans Day at Arlington National Cemetery for a ceremonial wreath laying.\n\nTrump praised the strength of the U.S. military and the death of Islamic State leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, saying the nation's veterans \"risked everything for us. Now it is our duty to serve and protect them every single day of our lives.\"\n\nMore than 100 protesters booed, some holding black balloons that read \"support our troops, impeach.\" In a liberal city where Trump is deeply unpopular in spite of his roots there, a nearby building's soaring windows were adorned with signs reading \"IMPEACH\" and \"CONVICT.\"\n\nVeterans overall have strongly backed Trump throughout his presidency, though views vary widely by party, gender and age, according to AP VoteCast, a survey of 2018 midterm voters. In particular, younger veterans and women generally were more skeptical of Trump, who received multiple draft deferments to avoid going to Vietnam.\n\nFormer Vice President Joe Biden, whose late son Beau spent a year in Iraq with the Army, stressed that he would \"restore trust\" in VA.\n\nTaking aim at Trump's stalled progress in reducing suicide among veterans, Biden pledged to hire more VA staff to cut down office wait times for vets at risk of suicide to zero as well as continuing the efforts of the Obama-Biden administration to stem homelessness.\n\nAbout 20 veterans die by suicide each day, a rate basically unchanged during the Trump administration. Trump earlier this year directed a Cabinet-level task force to develop a broader roadmap for veterans' suicide prevention, due out next spring.\n\n\"Our veterans deserve leaders who will fight for them as ardently and as forcefully as they have fought for us,\" Biden wrote in a Veterans Day statement with his wife, Jill.\n\nIn a jab at Trump, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders released a video highlighting his role in working with the late Republican Sen. John McCain, a decorated war hero, to pass legislation that included the Veterans Choice program in 2014.\n\nTrump routinely takes credit for being the first to enact the Choice program. What he actually got done was an expansion of the program achieved by McCain and Sanders, a former chairman of the Senate Veterans Affairs Committee.\n\nSpeaking at an event focused on seniors and veterans in Des Moines, Iowa, Sanders pledged to combat efforts to privatize the VA and assured a questioner that he would end the \"very ugly practice\" of deporting military veterans who are not U.S. citizens.\n\n\"How cruel is it that when people put their lives on the line to protect us,\" they are deported, he said.\n\nAs president, Sanders promised he would build upon his past legislative efforts by making it easier for veterans to get into the VA system.\n\nHe joins Buttigieg and Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren in urging increases in doctor pay to attract top VA candidates and fill 49,000 VA positions that have sat vacant as the Trump administration promoted private health care options.\n\nDuring a Veterans Day speech in Rochester, New Hampshire, Buttigieg reflected on his own military path, while taking some digs at Trump.\n\n\"Having seen the outrage of Americans willing to put their lives on the line for this country having their careers threatened by a president who avoided his own chance to serve, yes, we are going to end the transgender military ban right away,\" Buttigieg said.\n\nHe added later in the speech that the VA needs to be depoliticized.\n\n\"We're going to have five-year terms for key positions so that decisions are made based on what is best for veterans and not based on whoever last spoke to the president during a golf game or made the right campaign contribution,\" Buttigieg said.\n\nDuring a campaign stop in southeast Iowa, Biden noted that he carries with him every day the totals of those who have died as a consequence of wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.\n\nAs of Monday, he told about 200 people at a private college in Oskaloosa, the total had reached 6,900. \"Every single one of those fallen angels leave a broken community behind,\" he said.\n\nTens of thousands more, however, have returned home with post-traumatic stress disorder, Biden said. \"They are in trouble and they deserve every single thing we can give them,\" he said."

Will Hurd on Sunday broke with members of his party who have been calling for the release of the Ukraine whistleblower's identity, though he agreed with his party's calls to have Hunter Biden testify in the first public impeachment hearings set to begin this week.\n\nHurd, a retiring Texas Republican who spent years in the CIA, told \"Fox News Sunday\" host Chris Wallace that outing the whistleblower by compelling their testimony in a public hearing would send a chilling message to potential whistleblowers in the future.\n\n\"I think we should be protecting the identity of the whistleblower. I've said that from the very beginning because how we treat this whistleblower will impact whistleblowers in the future,\" Hurd argued. \"Having this whistleblower law on the books is important; it's important checks and balance are not only in the intelligence committee, but in our government.\"\n\nSome allies of President Donald Trump have agitated for the whistleblower, whose complaint this summer sparked the series of events leading to the ongoing impeachment inquiry, to come forward publicly, arguing the president deserves the chance to confront his accuser. They also argue the identity of the whistleblower is necessary to ascertain whether they have any political bias against the president, though the inspector general for the intelligence community found that despite an \"arguable\" bias, the whistleblower was still credible.\n\nThe whistleblower is on a list of witnesses Republicans on the House Intelligence Committee want to see testify this week and submitted to Chairman Adam Schiff (D-Calif.) this weekend, though Schiff has veto power over those requests and shut that notion down late Saturday.\n\nWhile Republicans have clamored for the whistleblower's public testimony, arguing that most of what the complaint contained is hearsay, nearly every accusation in the complaint has been independently confirmed over weeks of closed-door testimony from Trump administration officials.\n\nRight-wing media outlets have been circulating a name they claim is the whistleblower's, prompting an outcry from lawyers representing the whistleblower and concerns about the whistleblower's safety.\n\nBut while Hurd strayed from his party in calling for the continued protection of the whistleblower's identity, he echoed their calls for another potential witness whose appearance Schiff suggested he would deny: Hunter Biden, the son of former Vice President Joe Biden whose foreign business interests were at the root of Trump's Ukraine pressure campaign.\n\n\"I would love to hear from Hunter Biden, I would love to hear from other Americans that served on the board of Burisma,\" Hurd said, referring to the Ukrainian natural gas company that Biden sat on the board of. \"I'm curious to know of someone who doesn't have any experience in Ukraine nor experience in a natural gas company comes on board of a natural gas company in Ukraine.\n\n\"We also need to hear and understand the corruption. We know corruption in the Ukraine is an issue,\" Hurd continued, pointing to the testimony of numerous State Department officials. Trump and his allies, in a crusade led by Trump's personal attorney Rudy Giuliani, have asserted that Hunter Biden was hired by Burisma in 2015, while his father served as the U.S. point person on corruption in Ukraine, because of his family ties. There is no evidence indicating Hunter Biden had any influence on U.S. policy because of his position.\n\nSchiff swatted down this request from Republicans on Saturday, saying the impeachment inquiries \"will not serve, however, as a vehicle to undertake the same sham investigations into the Bidens or 2016 that the President pressed Ukraine to conduct for his personal political benefit.\""

        "text": "President Donald Trump is asking the Supreme Court to block a subpoena for his tax returns, in a test of the president's ability to defy investigations.\n\nThe filing Thursday sets the stage for a high court showdown over the tax returns Trump has refused to release, unlike every other modern president. The justices also could weigh in more broadly on Trump's claim that sitting presidents can't be prosecuted or investigated for crimes.\n\nThe subpoena from the Manhattan district attorney is seeking Trump's tax returns back to 2011 from his accounting firm as part of a criminal investigation. Trump's lawyers say a criminal probe of the president at the state or local level is unconstitutional and unprecedented in American history.\n\n\"Allowing the sitting president to be targeted for criminal investigation \u2014 and to be subpoenaed on that basis\u2014 would, like an indictment itself, distract him from the numerous and important duties of his office, intrude on and impair Executive Branch operations, and stigmatize the presidency,\" said the brief signed by Jay Sekulow.\n\nLower courts have so far rejected Trump's claims of immunity.\n\nTrump wants the court to decide the case by late June, under a deal to keep the district attorney from enforcing the subpoena in the meantime. The justices may not decide whether to hear the case for at least another month.\n\nA second, similar case is headed to the court over a House committee subpoena demanding Trump's financial records from the same accounting firm. The president has lost both cases at each step of the judicial system so far.\n\nThe Mazars USA firm has said it will comply with the subpoenas, if courts agree.\n\nA ruling against Trump would not require public release of the information. Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus R. Vance Jr. is seeking the records back to 2011 in a broader probe that includes payments made to buy the silence of two women, porn star Stormy Daniels and model Karen McDougal, who claim they had affairs with the president before the 2016 presidential election. Trump has denied the claims.\n\nVance spokesman Danny Frost declined to comment Thursday, saying the district attorney would be making its own Supreme Court filing next week.\n\nTrump is asking for the Supreme Court's intervention as the impeachment drama plays out elsewhere in Washington. Public impeachment hearings that began Wednesday are examining claims that Trump tried to get Ukraine's leader to investigate political rival Joe Biden.\n\nIf the House votes to impeach the president, Chief Justice John Roberts would preside at a Senate trial that is likely to begin in January.\n\nThe justices usually fill their term's calendar by late January.\n\nThe New York tax case is moving unusually swiftly through the federal courts. A three-judge panel of the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in New York ruled last week that the tax returns can be turned over to New York prosecutors.\n\nThe appellate judges emphasized the narrowness of their ruling, deciding only that a state prosecutor can demand Trump's personal financial records from a third party while the president is in office.\n\nTheir opinion upholding a trial judge's earlier ruling noted that they did not consider whether the president is immune from indictment and prosecution while in office or whether the president himself may be ordered to produce documents in a state criminal proceeding.\n\nThe subpoena does \"not implicate, in any way, the performance of his official duties,\" 2nd Circuit Chief Judge Robert A. Katzmann wrote.\n\nDuring arguments in a New York courtroom, Trump's lawyer told the 2nd Circuit that Trump is immune from state criminal law, even if he shoots someone, because he's president. The exchange stemmed from Trump's campaign trail comment in 2016 that he \"could stand in the middle of Fifth Avenue and shoot somebody, and I wouldn't lose any voters, OK?\"\n\nTrump's lawyers have said the probe by Vance, a Democrat, is politically motivated.\n\nThe Justice Department, which intervened on Trump's behalf in New York, has taken a narrower approach, saying Vance must prove \"particularized need\" for the records before they are released to a grand jury.\n\nIn the Washington case, the House Committee on Oversight and Reform subpoenaed records from Mazars in April. They include documents from 2011 to 2018 that the House wants for investigation into the president's reporting of his finances and potential conflicts of interest. The list of documents makes no mention of Trump's tax returns.\n\nThe full U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit voted Wednesday not to reconsider an earlier panel opinion ordering Mazars to comply with the subpoena.\n\nTrump's two appointees to the Washington court said the full court should have reheard the case.

He has strongly denied the allegations.\n\nHis opponents have been unrelenting in their criticism, earlier this year calling for Democrats to open impeachment hearings into his conduct.\n\nActivists have protested his position on the faculty of George Mason University's Antonin Scalia Law School for which he taught a summer course in England on the origins of the U.S. Constitution, and said his involvement in cases relating to women's rights would be forever tainted.\n\nOne of Kavanaugh's accusers, Christine Blasey Ford, recently defended her decision to deliver dramatic testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee in the days before a confirmation vote.\n\n\"I simply thought that it was my duty as a citizen and that anyone in my position would do the same thing,\" she said at a YWCA event where she was recognized for speaking out.\n\nFor his part, Kavanaugh has tried to smooth over the controversy.\n\n(MORE: Chief Justice John Roberts, who's clashed with Trump, would oversee impeachment trial)\nIn October 2018, after being sworn in, Kavanaugh addressed the nation from the East Room of the White House promising to \"be a force for stability and unity.\"\n\n\"The Senate confirmation process was contentious and emotional.

Conservatives have celebrated his votes as reliably supportive of their views.\n\nKavanaugh sided with Chief Justice John Roberts in every case except one during his first term. He voted to uphold a Latin cross war memorial on public land in Maryland, to allow the Trump administration to include a citizenship question on the 2020 Census, and to keep the courts out of policing partisan gerrymandering.\n\nIn February 2019, Kavanaugh broke with Roberts to dissent in a 5-4 decision blocking a controversial Louisiana abortion law from taking effect. But he joined the chief in siding with the liberal justices in a 2018 case involving Planned Parenthood funding.\n\n(MORE: Former President Bill Clinton reveals abortion conversation with Ruth Bader Ginsburg before nomination)\nBoth Kavanaugh and Gorsuch could prove to be critical votes for Trump in several cases.\n\nThe justices are deciding whether to uphold Trump's 2017 decision to end Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA, and whether to prohibit employment discrimination against LGBT Americans under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act, a position which Trump opposes.\n\nThe president's legal team also plans to appeal a lower federal court ruling ordering his accounting firm, Mazars, to turn over Trump's financial records to congressional investigators who have subpoenaed them."

        "text": "More than 234,000 voters in Wisconsin would be made unable to cast their ballot unless they register again before the next election under a lawsuit filed Wednesday that liberals fear could dampen turnout among Democrats in the 2020 presidential race.\n\nThe lawsuit could affect how many voters are able to cast ballots in both the April presidential primary and November 2020 general election in Wisconsin, a key swing state that both sides are targeting. President Donald Trump narrowly won the state by less than 23,000 votes in 2016.\n\nA conservative law firm, the Wisconsin Institute for Law and Liberty, alleges that the Wisconsin Elections Commission broke the law when it decided to wait up to two years to deactivate voters who may have moved. State law requires voters to respond within 30 days of receiving the October mailing or be deactivated, the lawsuit alleges.\n\nThe commission last month rejected a complaint from the group, also known as WILL, and said it was confident the commission was complying with the law. A spokesman for the commission, which is made up of an equal number of Republican and Democratic appointees, did not immediately reply to a message seeking comment Wednesday.\n\nBut Democratic Gov. Tony Evers, speaking with reporters after a bill signing in Wisconsin Dells, said he hoped the lawsuit would fail.\n\n\"We should spend our time in making it easier for people to vote rather than make it more difficult,\" Evers said. \"I'm hopeful that that lawsuit is thrown out.\"\n\nThe commission in October mailed notices to about 234,000 voters identified as potentially having moved. They had been flagged based on a review of documents from sources such as the Post Office and Division of Motor Vehicles that indicated the person may have moved.\n\nVoters who do not respond to the postcard asking them to confirm their address will be flagged as movers. But instead of being made unable to vote 30 days after the mailing, they will have up to two years to confirm their addresses, based on a June vote by the commission.\n\nElections commission staff said in a March memo that the commission had the authority to delay deactivating voters beyond 30 days because another state law gives it the ability to create rules maintaining the voter registration list. Staff said in the memo that since no voter would be removed until after the April 2021 election under its policy, there would be time to receive feedback from the Legislature about whether a legal change was necessary.\n\nUnder the commission's decision, voters flagged as movers will not be deactivated ahead of the February primary election for the state Supreme Court race and numerous local offices. It will also mean they will remain registered for the April presidential primary and spring general election in which a Supreme Court justice will be elected.\n\nThe lawsuit asks a judge to require the commission to deactivate any of the 234,000 voters who received notice in October that it appears they moved and did not respond within 30 days.\n\nThe concern from liberals is that younger and lower income voters who are more likely to vote Democratic are also more likely to be flagged as movers. The result, they fear, is that more Democrats would be required to re-register than Republicans, making it more difficult for them to vote.\n\nBut in the lawsuit, WILL contends that registering again is \"no hardship\" because voters can do it at the polls on election day. Voters must present a photo ID and proof of residence in order to register at the polls.\n\nThe lawsuit was filed in Ozaukee County Circuit Court on behalf of three voters in Hubertus, Port Washington and Menomonee Falls.\n\nThere are about 3.3 million registered voters in Wisconsin out of about 4.5 million people of voting age."

        "text": "It was substantive, but it wasn't dramatic.\n\nIn the reserved manner of veteran diplomats with Harvard degrees, Bill Taylor and George Kent opened the public phase of the House impeachment inquiry into President Donald Trump on Wednesday by bearing witness to a scheme they described as not only wildly unorthodox but also in direct contravention of U.S. interests.\n\n\"It is clearly in our national interest to deter further Russian aggression,\" Taylor, the acting U.S. ambassador to Ukraine and a decorated Vietnam War veteran, said in explaining why Trump's decision to withhold congressionally appropriated aid to the most immediate target of Russian expansionism didn't align with U.S. policy.\n\nBut at a time when Democrats are simultaneously eager to influence public opinion in favor of ousting the president and quietly apprehensive that their hearings could stall or backfire, the first round felt more like the dress rehearsal for a serious one-act play than the opening night of a hit Broadway musical.\n\nDuring five and a half hours of testimony, under questioning from House Intelligence Committee members from both parties and staff lawyers from each side of the aisle, the two men delivered a wide-ranging discourse on America's interests in Eastern Europe, diplomatic protocol and democratic norms \u2014 and how they believe Trump subverted all of them in service of political goals.\n\nAnd yet Taylor and Kent failed \u2014 or perhaps succeeded, given their nonpartisan roles in government and the atypically serious postures struck by lawmakers of both parties \u2014 by dropping no bombshells and largely repeating the testimony they gave congressional investigators at depositions previously held behind closed doors.\n\n\"If you have to do something that makes Republicans in this country believe the president has committed some serious infraction, then today was 'ball one,'\" said Matt Schlapp, a Trump ally who speaks frequently to White House officials and GOP lawmakers. \"It wasn't a wild pitch, but it wasn't close to the strike zone.\"\n\nTrump told reporters at the White House that he did not watch the proceedings.\n\n\"I hear it's a joke,\" he said. \"This is a sham, and it shouldn't be allowed.\"\n\nEven if the president wasn't watching, Rep. Peter Welch, D-Vt., told Republicans on the committee who want an intelligence community whistleblower to testify that Trump is welcome to defend himself under oath.\n\nFor their part, Republicans poked no real holes in witness testimony, spent little time defending Trump, and burned time off the clock by asking about conspiracy theories that have captivated their political base but that are easily debunked.\n\nAt one point, Rep. Jim Jordan of Ohio \u2014 who was added to the GOP's roster on the committee for the impeachment hearings \u2014 appeared to confound Taylor by insisting the president couldn't have conditioned aid for Ukraine on an investigation into political rival Joe Biden, because the money ultimately flowed and the probe was never announced.\n\nHouse Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, D-Calif., who avoided contentious back-and-forth exchanges with his GOP counterparts, waited until the end of the hearing to explain to the viewing audience that Trump released the funding only after the whistleblower complaint that would expose his plot arrived at the White House.\n\nDemocrats had prepared themselves for Republicans to try to hijack the hearing with procedural motions and wild lines of questioning, but that never quite materialized. The decorum on the GOP side was commendable enough in Schiff's view that he thanked the minority party in his concluding remarks.\n\nRepublicans conducted themselves in a \"serious\" and \"civil way,\" he said.\n\nThere wasn't much either side could grab onto.\n\nTaylor did create a stir when he told the committee that one of his aides had overheard an ambassador at the center of the story, Gordon Sondland, talking to the president about Ukraine on the phone. Afterward, Sondland told the staffer that Trump cared more about getting Ukraine to open investigations into Biden, a 2020 Democratic presidential candidate, and his son Hunter than about any issues that mattered to the Ukrainians.\n\nBut that served as more of a footnote than a headline.\n\nThe lawmakers will reconvene Friday with testimony from former U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch, who was ousted after Trump loyalists ran a disinformation campaign against her.\n\nDemocratic strategists say their side will have to do a better job to capture public attention.\n\n\"It's clear this is going to be a battle of narratives and messages,\" Democratic strategist Chris Kofinis said. \"Based on Day One, if the goal was to present a clear and easy-to-follow narrative, neither side did a stellar job. We need to stop presenting this like a foreign policy class \u2014 this needs to be about making a clear case about what the president did wrong, again and again. That narrative is getting lost.\"\n\nThere's time for Democrats to tell a more compelling version of the story \u2014 keeping in mind that the attention span of most Americans doesn't match that of most C-SPAN viewers."

Following the call with President Trump, the member of my staff asked Ambassador Sondland what President Trump thought about Ukraine. Ambassador Sondland responded that President Trump cares more about the investigations of Biden, which Giuliani was pressing for,\" Taylor said during his opening remarks on Wednesday.\n\nTaylor later added that he reported the matter to the State Department's legal adviser as well as the House Intelligence Committee and that it was his \"understanding\" that the committee would follow up on it.\n\nTaylor, who sat for a private deposition last month, was one of two State Department officials who testified Wednesday in the first public hearing of House Democrats' impeachment inquiry. Sondland, who also testified in private last month before Taylor, is slated to testify publicly in one week.\n\nTrump has sought to distance himself from Sondland, a wealthy hotelier and donor to his inauguration, though on Wednesday he highlighted one exchange during which he told Sondland there was \"no quid pro quo\" in his interactions with Ukraine.\n\n\"The only thing that I've seen that Sondland said was that \u2013 he did speak with me for a brief moment \u2013 and I said no quid pro quo under any circumstances,\" Trump said during the press conference with the Turkish president.\n\nDemocrats are investigating whether Trump leveraged a White House meeting and military assistance to Ukraine in order to pressure the country to pursue investigations that would benefit him politically\n\nSondland corrected his earlier testimony last week to say that, after reviewing testimony from other witnesses, he recalled a meeting with a Zelensky aide in early September during which he said aid to Ukraine would likely not flow unless Kyiv made a public statement about pursuing investigations. \n\nThe aid was eventually released and Ukraine did not make a public statement about the investigations.\n\nTrump labeled the House impeachment inquiry a \"sham\" that \"shouldn't be allowed\" when asked for his reaction to the hearing, which had just concluded, earlier during the press conference.\n\n\"You're talking about the witch hunt,\" Trump said, adding that he didn't watch the proceedings.\n\n\"I hear it's a joke,\" Trump continued, saying he was told the witnesses testifying Wednesday relied on \"thirdhand information.\"\n\nTrump has maintained he did nothing wrong on his call with Zelensky, urging people to read the transcript and saying he applied no pressure to Ukraine. Trump has also said he raised Biden on the call because he was focused on \"corruption\" and that it had nothing to do with his political campaign. "

But as his trial over lying to Congress and tampering with a witness nears its end, Stone has left his defense in the hands of external factors: lawyers, God, the race card, a coterie of MAGA-world figures and, if all else fails, President Donald Trump.\n\nGiven the chance to tell his side of the story, Stone chose not to take the witness stand. Given the opportunity to call witnesses, his attorneys opted instead to simply play portions of the congressional testimony in question.\n\nAs a legal strategy, it caught many by surprise, even if Stone\u8ab7 defenders have done their part in court since the trial started to poke as many holes as they can in the government\u8ab7 case.\n\nAs a political play, though, it might be perfectly tailored for a very different audience ?MAGA-ites and the president himself. After all, a conviction on any of the seven counts opens Stone up to prison time and raises the question of whether Trump would face pressure to issue an election-year pardon to his longtime friend, who has a passionate following in Trump land.\n\n\u8942f you hesitate about your conclusions in this matter then you have a reasonable doubt,?Bruce Rogow, the lead Stone defense attorney, told the jury during his closing arguments Wednesday. \u8947y job is to create for you the reasons why you should have a reasonable doubt.?\nOn Thursday, Stone\u8ab7 six-day trial will shift to jury deliberations and a verdict soon thereafter, the final coda to months of legal wrangling that kicked off in January with a dramatic early-morning raid to arrest Stone at his South Florida home.\n\nAs the case moved toward a trial, Stone and his family have been appealing to a higher power.\n\nThey were at Sunday morning Mass about 10 days before his trial: \u896dlease pray for us,?his wife, Nydia Stone, wrote on Instagram alongside a prayer emoji, the hashtags #trump and #maga and a tag for the president\u8ab7 Twitter handle.\n\nAnd before opening arguments last Tuesday, Stone\u8ab7 wife and daughter sat with a leather-bound Bible in their laps open to the Book of Psalms.\n\nThey were joined in the front row by Randy Short, a Washington, D.C., activist wearing a white religious smock who has described himself as Stone\u8ab7 spiritual adviser.\n\nIn fact, Short participated in a small rally outside the courthouse on the first day of the trial, leading a chant that Stone was innocent and interspersing a pro-Trump song with the chorus: \u8942\u8ab1 on the Trump train. We did it in ?6. Gonna do it again.?\nIn an interview, Short said Stone wasn\u8ab8 concerned about the government\u8ab7 parade of witnesses, which included Steve Bannon, the former Trump campaign CEO whom the government called to contradict Stone\u8ab7 deposition to Congress that there had been no contact with Trump\u8ab7 campaign about WikiLeaks.\n\n\u8942 don\u8ab8 think Bannon is someone that would worry them,?Short said. \u894eheir biggest fear from my sense is that there\u8ab7 so many [jurors] who have intelligence community or government ties or ties to the former administration or lawyers. Where are the blue collar people on that? Really? I\u8ab1 a Washingtonian. This city is still half black. If you look at the jury there are four blacks. There are two others and 10 white folks.

They tried to get potential D.C. jurors booted from the pool based on their professed opposition to Trump.\n\nThey challenged the government\u8ab7 witnesses, getting an FBI agent who obtained Stone\u8ab7 communications to admit she didn\u8ab8 know the content of Stone\u8ab7 phone conversations even though they leaned on his phone records. They also got her to concede that she didn\u8ab8 know whether Stone followed through on any alleged threats he made in emails.\n\nLater, Stone\u8ab7 team pressed Bannon to acknowledge that Stone never actually told him directly that he had WikiLeaks connections. Bannon said Stone simply gave him that impression.\n\nWith former Trump campaign deputy Rick Gates, Stone\u8ab7 lawyers largely tried to shred his credibility, reminding the jury that he had already pleaded guilty of lying to special counsel Robert Mueller\u8ab7 team.

That brought more of Stone\u8ab7 voice into the trial, but jurors never heard directly from the normally voluble counterpuncher.\n\nAnd so it was left to Stone\u8ab7 lawyers to speak on his behalf. Their argument? Stone\u8ab7 election-year behavior was de rigueur in politics. Candidates use opposition research all the time, they said.\n\n\u894ehis is what happens in campaigns,?Rogow said.\n\nWhy would Stone have lied to lawmakers, Rogow asked the jury, given that he offered to speak publicly to the House panel and he even appeared without a subpoena?\n\n\u894ehere\u8ab7 no motive for Mr. Stone to do this,?he said.\n\nIt was the most Stone\u8ab7 defense team had directly addressed the government\u8ab7 arguments in months. Before last week, Stone and his attorneys had mostly pushed a narrative that Stone was the victim of a political hit job, carried out with the help of the media and the deep state.\n\nThey filed pleadings slamming the media and accusing prosecutors of trying to crimp Stone\u8ab7 speech at the same time he was the subject of tens of thousands of hostile articles and a mocking Steve Martin impression on \u894daturday Night Live.?\nUltimately, Jackson banned Stone in July from using Facebook, Twitter or any social media to trumpet this narrative.\n\nHer decision came after an initial warning over a Stone Instagram post that appeared to show a gun\u8ab7 crosshairs above a picture of Jackson\u8ab7 head. Stone took the witness stand to apologize for the incident, saying he didn\u8ab8 fully control his Instagram account.\n\nWith Stone silenced, some of his supporters picked up the torch and pushed the limits even further.\n\nInfoWars founder Alex Jones last week erroneously reported the name of a juror in the Stone trial based on the description that one woman gave identifying herself in open court as a former Obama-era communications aide for the Office of Management and Budget. Jones called her a \u896ainion.?\n\u8951e\u8abae got to have Obama\u8ab7 former communications director hang Roger. Hell, if they give him the death penalty, maybe she can hang him and kick the lever and he\u8ab0l break his neck and she can piss all over his dead body,?Jones said.\n\nWhen Jackson found out about the incendiary remarks emanating from the far-right mediasphere, she chastised the rhetoric as \u8972ninformed?and \u8972nfortunately false.?\n\u8942t puts the safety of all the people on both sides, including possibly the jury, at risk,?she said.\n\nIn court, however, the outside hyperbole has had to grapple with Stone\u8ab7 previous words, including a mountain of emails and text messages that seem to drip with contempt for the House\u8ab7 fact-finding effort and Mueller\u8ab7 investigation.\n\n\u894eell him to go f--- himself,?Stone wrote about Mueller in one text message to liberal radio host and erstwhile friend Randy Credico.\n\nIt doesn\u8ab8 matter what Stone is ?or isn\u8ab8 ?saying now, prosecutors told the jurors. They have all the Stone commentary needed to render a verdict.\n\n\u894ehe evidence here is written down for you,?prosecutor Michael Marando said in his closing argument Wednesday. \u894ehis is literally the defendant\u8ab7 words.?\n"

Just petty politicians trying to undo @realDonaldTrump's victory. Now, if only the ringleaders would let Congress get back to work on behalf of the American people,\" read a post from Rep. Roger Marshall (R-Kan.) that the president highlighted.\n\nThe House's impeachment inquiry was launched in September amid Democratic concerns that Trump leveraged $400 million in military aid to pressure Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to publicly open an investigation into unfounded corruption allegations against former Vice President Joe Biden, a top political rival, and his son.\n\nThe White House has repeatedly blasted the House investigation as a \"witch hunt\" and decried Democrats' efforts as \"unhinged\" after they voted to formalize the inquiry late last month. \n\nDemocrats have countered the president has abused his oath of office by seeking to involve foreign nations in U.S. domestic politics after publicizing testimony from several witnesses who said there was a quid pro quo surrounding Trump's dealings with Ukraine\n\nTrump has repeatedly railed against the inquiry on the campaign trail, accusing Democrats of trying to reverse the results of the 2016 presidential race. However, he went a step further Saturday, retweeting messages specifically linked to witnesses who have already testified in the probe.\n\n\"The Dems/media are desperately relying on Taylor as their star witness to show there was an impeachable offense of quid pro quo. Aside from the fact he admits he has no idea what quid pro quo even means, Taylor also admitted to me his claims aren't based on 1st hand knowledge,\" Rep. Lee Zeldin (R-N.Y.) said in a tweet about William Taylor, who serves as the charg\u00e9 d'affaires for Ukraine and testified that he believed there was a quid pro quo with Ukraine, that was retweeted by Trump.\n\nThe president's Saturday morning tweetstorm underscores the extent to which the House's impeachment investigation has consumed his attention, leading some allies to worry that his focus should be more equally shared between the probe and his legislative priorities. \n\n\"Then they all wonder why they don't get gun legislation done, then they wonder why they don't get drug prices lowered,\" Trump said in September. \"Because all they do is talk nonsense.

I know what you've given up,\" Harris said.\n\nCulinary Workers Union Local 226, a 60,000-member group of housekeepers, bartenders, porters and others that keep the glittering resorts of Las Vegas humming, is one of the most powerful political forces in Nevada, the third state to weigh in on the presidential contest next year.\n\nAn endorsement from the organization could be decisive in the state's February caucuses.\n\nThe union has not yet decided it if will endorse anyone in the primary, but it's listening to candidates and telling them what workers want, secretary-treasurer Geoconda Arg\u00fcello-Kline said.\n\nThough most of the Democratic candidates have held private meetings with the union's leaders, Harris was the first to get a coveted invite to speak to members. About 250 gathered to hear her Friday night at the union's hall north of the Las Vegas Strip.\n\nThe group is planning more town halls with other top Democratic candidates, though it has declined to say which have received invitations.\n\nNevada, considered the first test of a candidate's appeal in a diverse state, has a 29% Latino population. The heavily immigrant, majority Latino union is seen as a key mobilizer of Latino voters and does outreach in English and Spanish, as well as in Tagalog, Amharic and Chinese.\n\nThe union's organizing is credited with helping former U.S. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid win a tough re-election campaign in 2010 and delivering Democratic victories in 2016 and 2018.\n\nIn the state's early presidential nominating caucuses, the Democratic Party traditionally sets up at-large caucusing locations near the Las Vegas Strip, which allows casino shift workers to participate in the meetings.\n\nThe union's backing hasn't always translated to a slam-dunk for candidates: In 2014, union-backed Democratic Rep. Steven Horsford lost in a Republican wave.\n\nIn 2008, the union decided to back Barack Obama over Hillary Clinton. The move was a boon to Obama, who won more delegates in Nevada, but Clinton won the popular vote and had a strong showing at the at-large caucus sites near the Strip.\n\nThe union sat out the 2016 Democratic primary.\n\nSome of the 2020 candidates have waded into the union's dispute with Station Casinos over unionizing votes at several of the company's Las Vegas properties, issuing statements urging the company to join the bargaining table.\n\nHarris on Friday told a worker at one of the company's properties that she had called one of the company's executives to press that point.\n\nThe California senator pumped her fist and led members in chants of \"We vote, we win\" and \"Si, se puede\" before describing her plans to use executive orders as president to extend protections for young immigrants in the country illegally and their families.\n\nArg\u00fcello-Kline said that along with health care, good jobs and workers' rights, immigration is a top priority for the union."

Luis Arroyo to take part in choosing his replacement, after the Chicago Democrat resigned in disgrace following his arrest on federal bribery charges.\n\nArroyo resigned from the Illinois House on Nov. 1, four days after federal prosecutors charged him with bribing a state senator in exchange for the senator's support of sweepstakes-related legislation that would benefit one of Arroyo's lobbying clients.\n\nHowever, Arroyo remains the Democratic committeeman for the 36th Ward in Chicago, despite a unanimous vote from the Cook County Democratic Party executive committee urging him to step down from his party post.\n\nAs the party's 36th Ward committeeman, Arroyo has the largest share of votes in picking a successor to take his place until the 2020 election. According to published reports, Arroyo had sent a letter to other committeemen representing voters in the 3rd District of the Illinois House to schedule a meeting on Friday to vote on filling his old seat in the Illinois General Assembly.\n\nMadigan, who also chairs the Illinois Democratic Party, wants to make sure Arroyo doesn't get a vote in naming his successor, and sent the same committeemen a letter asking them to keep Arroyo out of the process.\n\n\"Today, I wrote to the Democratic committee members responsible for filling the vacancy in the 3rd Representative District, and asked them to conduct their process without the participation of the 36th Ward. Any process that includes the participation of the 36th Ward ?whether by direct vote or by proxy ?would call the legitimacy of the appointment into question, and the qualifications of their candidate would be challenged by the full Illinois House of Representatives.\"\n\nArroyo, 65, has been charged with one count of federal program bribery. Federal prosecutors said he was caught on tape paying a $2,500 bribe to a state senator who was wearing a wire for the feds.\n\nThe feds say Arroyo had agreed to pay the senator $2,500 a month for up to a year in exchange for the senator's support of sweepstakes-related legislation that would benefit one of Arroyo's lobbying clients.\n\nThe charges against Arroyo do not identify the senator involved in the case, identifying the lawmaker only as \"Cooperating Witness 1.\" But that witness has been identified by multiple news outlets as state Sen. Terry Link (D-Vernon Hills), who is the assistant majority leader in the Illinois State Senate.\n\nAccording to the charges, on Aug. 2, Arroyo offered to pay the senator $2,500 a month for his support for the sweepstakes legislation. On Aug. 22, the two met at a restaurant in Skokie, and Arroyo gave the senator a check for $2,500 as an initial payment, with the expectation Arroyo would continue paying $2,500 a month for 6 to 12 months.\n\nLink allegedly recorded the conversation for the feds. He expects to be charged with filing false income tax returns in 2016 and is apparently cooperating in the hopes of a lighter punishment.\n\nLink has publicly denied he is the state senator in question."

        "text": "Oklahoma lawmaker ditches bid to name stretch of Route 66 after Trump Oklahoma lawmakers file bill to create Donald Trump highway\n\nDahm\nThe debate around naming an Oklahoma highway mirrored the divisive national political climate this week after two state senators filed legislation to put the president's name on a four-mile stretch of historic Route 66.\n\nThe proposal speaks to President Donald Trump's popularity Oklahoma, where he won all 77 counties and continues to outpace the Democratic presidential candidates in fundraising. But the response spoke to the emotional reaction Trump elicits from people across the political spectrum.\n\nSens. Nathan Dahm, R-Broken Arrow, and Marty Quinn, R-Claremore, filed legislation this week to christen a short section of Route 66 in northeastern Oklahoma the President Donald J. Trump Highway.\n\nThe proposal faced near-immediate pushback from Republicans and Democrats alike who condemned the politicization of the celebrated Mother Road, also already known as the Will Rogers Highway.\n\nBut the legislation also ignited a firestorm of political commentary on the Trump administration with the president's supporters praising the idea of a Trump highway and his critics painting the legislation as a \"political stunt\" to distract as Congress moves forward with impeachment proceedings.\n\nDahm dismissed the idea that his bill was a response to the impeachment proceedings or a political stunt.\n\n\"If it was actually a political stunt, I would have done it on Oct. 24, which is Hillary Clinton's birthday, because there will never be a President Hillary Clinton highway in Oklahoma or anywhere else,\" he said.\n\nClinton's birthday is Oct. 26\n\nIt's not unusual for a state to name a section of highway after a president, said James Davenport, a political science professor at Rose State College. But it's this specific president and the current political climate that make this proposal so contentious, he said, calling Trump a \"lightning-rod figure.\"\n\nOklahoma has bridges named after Presidents Franklin Roosevelt and George W. Bush and a highway named after Lyndon Johnson.\n\n\"It's one of those things that if it wasn't Donald Trump, it would almost be noncontroversial,\" Davenport said.\n\n\"He's one of those unique political figures where there's nobody in the middle. You either really like Trump or you really hate him, and there's not much in between, so anything relating to him is going to stir up this kind of controversy.\"\n\nDahm said he introduced the legislation because the Trump highway signs could spark conversations about the president and his accomplishments. The signs, which would cost about $700 each for a total of $1,400, would be covered by legislators who support the measure.\n\nRight now, people are so divided by Trump they can't seem to have any even sort of civil discourse on politics or the president, Dahm said. People are focusing too much on politics and taking it way too seriously, he said.\n\nMost of the social media messages Dahm has received since introducing the bill have been people calling him names, he said.\n\n\"You've got to be able to keep things lighthearted on occasion,\" he said. \"We're talking about a sign on a roadway, OK. This isn't a life-or-death situation. This isn't the end of the world and this isn't the only thing that I'm working on.\"\n\nThe legislation picked out a four-mile section of Route 66 that goes through Commerce, population 2,401.\n\nBut Lt. Gov. Matt Pinnell, who is in charge of the state's marketing and branding, asked Dahm to pick another highway, saying naming a section of Route 66 after Trump would \"dilute\" the distinct American experience the highway represents.\n\nRep. Ben Loring, D-Miami, who said the proposed legislation would negatively affect tourism on Route 66 and strongly suggested Dahm and Quinn find another location.\n\n\"Please pick another road, and I would suggest one in your own Districts,\" Loring said in a statement.\n\nDespite choosing a section of Route 66 \"because it's larger than life just like President Trump,\" Dahm said he's open to selecting another highway.\n\nIf the legislation gains traction during the 2020 legislative session, which starts in February, it will be folded into a broad highway and bridge-naming bill.\n\nDahm and Quinn are not the first to state legislators to propose naming a highway after the sitting president.\n\nLast year, a state representative in Utah proposed naming a 631-mile stretch of scenic highway after the president, but he quickly reversed course after facing death threats and a slew of personal attacks."

Mr. Hastings, 83, has employed Patricia Williams since at least 2000, according to The Post, and in 2017, the pair bought a $700,000 house near Boynton Beach.\n\nMr. Hastings was impeached and removed from the federal bench in 1989 after the Senate found him guilty of eight impeachment articles, including one charging that he had conspired to receive a $150,000 bribe. Ms. Williams served as co-counsel with Mr. Hastings as he defended himself against those allegations, and according to The South Florida Sun-Sentinel, Mr. Hastings still owes legal fees to her \u2014  likely the reason for the committee's examination of whether he has received any inappropriate gifts or \"forbearance.\"\n\nThe relationship received renewed scrutiny last month, when the ethics committee announced that it would investigate allegations that Representative Katie Hill of California, a first-term Democrat, had a sexual relationship with a member of her congressional staff. Ms. Hill has since resigned after admitting to an improper sexual relationship with a campaign aide, though she denied the charge being examined by the committee.\n\n\"As they continue to conduct their work, I stand ready to fully cooperate with their inquiry,\" Mr. Hastings said in a statement, adding that he had been doing so since May.\n\nThis is the third investigation the Ethics Committee has announced this month into allegations that a sitting member of Congress had violated House rules codified this year that bar lawmakers from having relationships with members of their staffs.

        "text": "Shock, anger and sadness are giving way to pride among career diplomats that they are defending American ideals and holding the Trump administration accountable.\n\nFollow our live coverage of Marie Yovanovitch\u8ab7 public impeachment inquiry hearing.\n\nWASHINGTON ?State Department Foreign Service officers usually express their views in formal diplomatic cables, but these days they are using closed Facebook groups and encrypted apps to convey their pride in Marie L. Yovanovitch, the ousted ambassador to Ukraine, whose House testimony opened the floodgates on the impeachment inquiry into President Trump.\n\n#GoMasha is their rallying cry.\n\nIn private conversations, they trade admiring notes about career State Department officials like William B. Taylor Jr. and George P. Kent, who delivered damning testimony about a shadow Ukraine policy infected by partisan politics and presidential conspiracy theories, and William V. Roebuck, a senior diplomat in Syria who wrote a searing memo on how Mr. Trump abandoned the Kurds and upended American influence.\n\nAnd they are opening their wallets to help raise money ?including nearly $10,000 last Monday alone ?to offset the legal bills of department officials called to testify before Congress.\n\nRarely has the State Department, often seen as a staid pillar of the establishment, been the center of a revolt against a president and his top appointees. But as a parade of department officials has recounted to lawmakers how policy was hijacked by partisan politics, many career diplomats say they have been inspired by their colleagues?willingness to stand up to far more powerful voices after nearly three years of being ignored or disparaged by Mr. Trump and those he has chosen to lead the department.\n\nIn fact, when open impeachment hearings begin next week, the first to testify will be diplomats, appearing despite directives from the White House for administration officials to defy Congress on such requests. They will include Ms. Yovanovitch, whose abrupt recall in May under suspicious circumstances was a galvanizing moment for her colleagues.\n\n\u8951hat we\u8abae seen is a dawning recognition that Foreign Service officers are just as deeply patriotic as their colleagues in the military,?said Molly Montgomery, who spent 14 years in the Foreign Service before leaving government last year after a stint in the office of Vice President Mike Pence. \u894ehere\u8ab7 a feeling of immense pride that the public is seeing Foreign Service officers for who they are.?\nBut the uprising has come at a cost, deepening the divide between career diplomats and an administration that took office determined to cut their budget and diminish their influence. And in interviews over recent days, department officials acknowledged that this moment of team spirit would probably prove fleeting, and that the State Department would return to what current and former diplomats described as a crisis of morale.\n\nA growing number of Foreign Service officers have opted to leave, many earlier than planned; one recent retirement class was by far the largest ever, according to the American Foreign Service Association.\n\nSome of those who remain are shying away from plum policy jobs that in any other time would be considered a career boost. Instead, they are choosing to \u8964ide out?in language training and other low-profile postings, hoping to avoid being tainted by the politics of the Trump administration ?or even being noticed by officials watchful for dissenters.\n\n\u894ehere\u8ab7 outrage over the mistreatment of career officers and failure to stand up for them,?said William J. Burns, who served as an ambassador under four presidents and, during the Obama administration, became only the second career diplomat to ascend to deputy secretary of state. \u894ehere\u8ab7 pride in the dignity of those officers in these undignified times, and in how vividly their plain-spoken courage and professionalism brings to life the wider value of public service.?\nImage\nWilliam B. Taylor Jr., a career State Department official, delivered damning testimony about a shadow Ukraine policy.Credit...Anna Moneymaker/The New York Times\nMr. Burns added, \u894ehere\u8ab7 growing concern about the hollowing out of American diplomacy and the huge challenge of its renewal.?\nThe competing feelings of pride and despair were evident in interviews with more than 20 current Foreign Service officers and State Department civil servants, as well as several more officials who recently departed after long careers on the diplomatic front lines. The current officials spoke on the condition of anonymity for fear of what they called potentially career-ending retaliation from Trump political appointees.\n\nLike the military or the C.I.A., the State Department is its own separate culture and one that views the world in terms very different than Mr. Trump\u8ab7. And this is particularly true for the Foreign Service, a cadre of about 13,000 professional diplomats within the department who are stationed in embassies and consulates abroad.\n\nAs with the military, an immunity to domestic politics is among the Foreign Service\u8ab7 most cherished ideals.\n\nThat is not to say that career diplomats have no personal opinions about the presidents and secretaries they serve, but even career officials who have worked for multiple presidents of both parties say they have seen nothing like the Trump era.\n\n\u8942 wake up and read the testimony and I\u8ab1 proud of my colleagues for telling the truth,?said an American diplomat serving in Asia. \u893aut my heart hurts when I see how they\u8ab6e being treated by our own president.?\nAnd one crucial difference with the military is the culture of dissent that is a point of pride in the State Department. The American Foreign Service Association even bestows multiple awards each year for diplomats who have shown \u8965ntegrity, intellectual courage and constructive dissent,?and past secretaries of state have said they appreciate differing opinions.\n\nBut Mr. Trump and his allies have made clear that they see the diplomats crying foul over his Ukraine policy as \u8960eep state?saboteurs. After Mr. Taylor\u8ab7 appearance on Capitol Hill last month, Mr. Trump lashed out at him, without evidence, as a \u8948ever Trumper.?\n\u894cight now I think morale is really probably as low as I have ever known it in the 35 years that I served in the Foreign Service,?said Linda Thomas-Greenfield, a former director general of the Foreign Service who retired from the State Department in 2017.\n\nMany diplomats expressed hope when Mr. Trump named as his first secretary of state Rex W. Tillerson, the former Exxon Mobil executive who had no government experience but had worked closely with several foreign governments. But Mr. Tillerson spent his first few months freezing hiring, acquiescing to huge budget cuts and doing what he called redefining \u8969ines of authority?rather than focusing on Russia, China and a fracturing Middle East.\n\nImage\nMike Pompeo, the secretary of state, has a close relationship with President Trump.Credit...Jens Meyer/Associated Press\nTheir mood brightened with the arrival in April 2018 of Mr. Tillerson\u8ab7 successor, Mike Pompeo, who dropped the critique of the department as bloated, and vowed to return \u8970wagger?to its limping ranks. Unlike Mr. Tillerson, who was brusquely fired, Mr. Pompeo is close to Mr. Trump, and initially restored a sense of relevancy to the department.\n\nBut the imbroglio over Ukraine has renewed, and even sharpened, the despair by revealing the way Trump administration officials were willing to withhold American aid until Ukraine committed to investigating the president\u8ab7 political enemies.\n\nIt has also exposed how Mr. Pompeo allowed an inexperienced Trump donor turned ambassador to the European Union, Gordon D. Sondland, to assume a lead role in Ukraine policy, and how Mr. Pompeo agreed to remove Ms. Yovanovitch from her job in Ukraine after she became the target of unfounded rumors circulated by the president\u8ab7 personal lawyer Rudolph W. Giuliani.\n\nAnd it has demonstrated that Mr. Pompeo\u8ab7 close alliance with Mr. Trump, which comes in part from an instinct to please the president that Mr. Tillerson lacked, may translate to more direct, and unwelcome, White House influence over the State Department\u8ab7 work.\n\nCareer diplomats and civil servants described an internal reckoning over the Ukraine affair not unlike the stages of grief: an initial sense of shock, replaced by anger, giving way to sadness.\n\nFor now, however, those feelings are leavened by satisfaction at seeing career diplomats trained to shun the limelight step forward to defend American ideals under enormous pressure.\n\nWith the exception of Lt. Col. Alexander S. Vindman, the Harvard-educated Army officer who served as a White House adviser on Ukraine, it has been career State Department employees who have provided the most damning evidence of Mr. Trump\u8ab7 pressure campaign on Ukraine.\n\nMs. Yovanovitch told House investigators that Mr. Giuliani tried to get a visa for a Ukrainian prosecutor the State Department had already rejected because of his corrupt dealings. Her successor in Kiev, Mr. Taylor, testified that it was Mr. Giuliani\u8ab7 idea to pressure Ukraine\u8ab7 president to publicly commit to an inquiry into Mr. Trump\u8ab7 political opponents.\n\nMr. Kent, a deputy assistant secretary of state, said Mr. Trump apparently wanted Ukraine\u8ab7 president to investigate the family of former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., as well as Hillary Clinton. And Michael McKinley, who directly advised Mr. Pompeo and served as a liaison for the Foreign Service, quit because he felt Mr. Trump was using the State Department for political gain.\n\nImage\nMichael McKinley quit the State Department after 37 years because of concerns involving Mr. Trump.Credit...Anna Moneymaker/The New York Times\n\u8942n 37 years in the Foreign Service and different parts of the globe and working on many controversial issues, working 10 years back in Washington, I had never seen that,?Mr. McKinley told House lawmakers last month.\n\nAt the same time, Mr. McKinley said that Mr. Pompeo had taken important steps to stabilize his department after Mr. Tillerson\u8ab7 unhappy tenure. Mr. Pompeo \u8960oes deserve credit for rebuilding the institution, processes, creating opportunities, and, frankly, ambitions for the Foreign Service,?he said.\n\nThe weeks of testimony offered a rare glimpse of a State Department culture that normally avoids the spotlight, and served as a kind of catharsis for the pent-up frustrations of American diplomats across the world.\n\n\u894ehey\u8ab6e saying what we all think,?one career State Department official in Washington said of the testimony.\n\nEric S. Rubin, a former ambassador to Bulgaria and the president of the American Foreign Service Association, which represents career diplomats, said the impeachment inquiry had provided \u895bn opportunity to talk to our fellow Americans about what we do, and why it matters for America\u8ab7 security and prosperity.?\nHis organization has raised tens of thousands of dollars for diplomats?legal defense, mostly in small donations, and not just from people who work at the State Department. The one requirement for contributing, Mr. Rubin said, \u8965s that you have to be an American.?\nSome career diplomats fear that the new respect they have earned from the public may do little to shield them from Trump administration officials who are probably wary of them now more than ever, particularly if the president is elected to a second term next year.\n\n\u894ehere\u8ab7 a deep worry about what will become of the Foreign Service when this is all over,?said Ms. Montgomery, the former Foreign Service officer who briefly worked for Mr. Pence, \u895bbout who will be left, and whether the norm of an apolitical Foreign Service trusted by the State Department\u8ab7 political leadership can be restored.?\nReporting was contributed by Hannah Beech in Bangkok, Aurelien Breeden in Paris, Steven Erlanger in Brussels, Jason Horowitz in Rome, Benjamin Novak in Budapest, Marc Santora in Warsaw and Edward Wong in Hong Kong."

        "text": "After weeks in which President Trump's top aides have figured as the major players in the Ukraine narrative, testimony in the first few hours of the public impeachment hearings Wednesday thrust Trump himself back to center stage.\n\nActing ambassador to Ukraine William B. Taylor Jr. told lawmakers about a previously unknown effort by the president to make sure Ukraine was looking into his political opponents: a phone conversation he said Trump had with a top U.S. diplomat asking about the status of \"the investigations.\"\n\nThe phone conversation described by Taylor gave Democrats a chance to renew questions about Trump's personal involvement in the effort to push Ukraine to investigate his political opponents while the United States withheld security assistance and a sought-after White House meeting.\n\nTrump says he's 'too busy to watch' public impeachment hearing\n\n0:33\n\nPresident Trump answered a question about the first public impeachment hearing Nov. 13 while meeting Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan at the White House. (Video: The Washington Post)\n\nRep. Peter Welch (D-Vt.) said he would be \"glad to have the person who started it all come in and testify.\"\n\n\"President Trump is welcome to take a seat right there,\" Welch said, gesturing to the witness desk.\n\nOn Wednesday afternoon, Trump denied any knowledge of the phone call described by Taylor.\n\n\"I know nothing about that,\" Trump said during a White House news conference with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan. \"First time I've heard it. .\u2009.\u2009. I don't recall, not at all, not even a little bit.\"\n\nThe key impeachment question: What did Trump want from Ukraine \u2014 and what exactly did he do?\n\nBefore Wednesday, the president had surfaced in two key moments: a May 23 Oval Office meeting, in which he told U.S. officials to confer with his personal attorney Rudolph W. Guiliani on Ukraine policy, and a July 25 phone call when he asked Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate Democrats.\n\nTaylor kicked off the first public hearing of the impeachment inquiry by describing another act by Trump \u2014 a phone conversation he said the president had with U.S. Ambassador to the European Union Gordon Sondland a day after the call between the two presidents.\n\nTaylor told lawmakers that his aide was accompanying Sondland during a July 26 visit to Kyiv when, in a restaurant, Sondland phoned Trump to update him about meetings he was having in the city, including a sit-down with a top Zelensky adviser.\n\nTaylor said that the aide overheard Trump ask Sondland about \"the investigations\" and that Sondland told the president the Ukrainians were \"ready to move forward.\"\n\nTaylor said his aide later asked Sondland what Trump thought about Ukraine. Sondland said that Trump cared \"more about the investigations of Biden, which Giuliani was pressing for,\" Taylor testified.\n\nSondland told reporters in Ukraine on July 27 that he spoke to Trump after the Zelensky call, but it is unclear if he was referring to the same conversation that Taylor described.\n\nSondland attorney Robert Luskin said in an email to The Washington Post that his client \"will address any issues that arise from this in his testimony next week,\" when he is scheduled to testify in another open hearing.\n\nTaylor's account of the call undercuts Trump's recent claims that he doesn't know Sondland, whom he called a \"really good man and great American\" in a tweet last month.\n\nBut last week, Trump told reporters at the White House, \"Let me just tell you: I hardly know the gentleman.\" The president's comment came after Sondland reversed his previous testimony in the impeachment inquiry, acknowledging that he told a Ukrainian official in September that U.S. military aid probably would resume only if the Kyiv government opened Trump's desired investigations.\n\nTaylor said he had not provided his account to investigators during his Oct. 22 closed-door deposition because his staff member told him about the episode only last Friday.\n\n\"I am including it here for completeness,\" Taylor said of the information, adding that \"it is my understanding that the committee is following up on this matter.\"\n\nTaylor said he also reported the story through counsel to the House Intelligence Committee and the State Department's legal adviser.\n\n\u2018Talk to Rudy': Testimony from diplomats highlights Giuliani's central role in driving Ukraine policy\n\nThe aide who overheard Sondland's call with the president is embassy staffer David Holmes, who will testify Friday behind closed doors in the House's impeachment probe, according to two people familiar with the investigation. Holmes is the top political affairs officer at the U.S. Embassy in Ukraine.\n\nHolmes received an award from theAmerican Foreign Service Association in 2014 for speaking up internally against the Obama administration's policy on Afghanistan, potentially complicating any Republican plans to paint him as a liberal partisan. The William R. Rivkin Award acknowledges a mid-level Foreign Service officer and recognizes the value of dissent, according to the American Foreign Service Association journal.\n\nTrump's first known role in the effort to pressure Ukraine took place in the Oval Office meeting May 23, when he instructed a U.S. delegation that had just returned from Zelensky's inauguration to \"talk to Rudy,\" referring to Giuliani, about Ukraine policy, according to witness testimony.\n\n\"Rudy had some bad issues with Ukraine, and until Rudy was satisfied, the president wasn't going to change his mind,\" Sondland said in a closed-door deposition.\n\nTwo months later, during the July 25 phone call, Trump told Zelensky that \"whatever you can do\" to investigate former vice president Joe Biden and his son Hunter Biden \"would be great\" and urged him to speak with Giuliani and Attorney General William P. Barr.\n\n\"We will get to the bottom of it,\" Trump said. \"I'm sure you will figure it out.\"\n\nCorrection: A previous version of this report stated incorrectly that Holmes had received the William R. Rivkin award from the State Department. The award came from the American Foreign Service Association.\n\nAaron C.

Taylor Jr., the acting U.S. ambassador to Ukraine. Taylor said one of his staffers overhead the call while Sondland was in a restaurant the day after Trump's July 25 phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy that triggered the House impeachment inquiry.\n\nThe second diplomatic staffer also at the table was Suriya Jayanti, a foreign service officer based in Kyiv. A person briefed on what Jayanti overheard spoke to AP on condition of anonymity to discuss a sensitive matter currently under investigation.\n\nTrump on Wednesday said he did not recall the July 26 call.\n\n\"No, not at all, not even a little bit,\" Trump said.\n\nWATCH: The Trump Impeachment Hearings \u2013 Day 1\n\nThe staffer Taylor testified about is David Holmes, the political counselor at the embassy in Kyiv, according to an official familiar with the matter who spoke on condition of anonymity.\n\nHolmes is scheduled to testify Friday before House investigators in a closed session.\n\nTaylor was one of the first witnesses called Wednesday during the impeachment inquiry's initial open hearing. He testified that his staffer could hear Trump on the phone asking Sondland about \"the investigations.\"\n\nThe accounts of Holmes and Jayanti could tie Trump closer to alleged efforts to hold up military aid to Ukraine in exchange for investigations into political rival Joe Biden and his son Hunter's business dealings.\n\nCurrent and former U.S. officials say Sondland's use of a cellphone in a public place in Ukraine to speak with anyone in the U.S. government back home about sensitive matters, let alone the president, would be a significant breach of communications security.\n\nJayanti is an attorney who joined the State Department in 2012 and was previously posted at the U.S. Embassy in Iraq. She has been stationed since September 2018 at the embassy in Kyiv where she helps coordinate U.S. business interests with the former Soviet republic's energy industry.\n\nJayanti was in Washington last month and scheduled for a closed-door interview with impeachment investigators. But the deposition was canceled because of the funeral for former House Oversight Chair Elijah Cummings and has not yet been rescheduled.\n\nHolmes, a career diplomat, joined the Foreign Service in 2002 and has served in Afghanistan, Colombia, India, Kosovo and Russia as well as on the White House National Security Council staff. He won an award for constructive dissent from the American Foreign Service Association in 2014 for complaining about problems that an alternate diplomatic channel had caused in South Asia and recommending organizational changes to the State Department's bureaucratic structure for the region.\n\nU.S. diplomats and other government employees are instructed not to use cellphones for sensitive official matters while traveling anywhere abroad but notably in countries known to be targeted for surveillance by intelligence agencies such as Russia, China and Israel.\n\nUkraine has long been among the countries of concern, particularly since a 2014 incident in which the U.S. accused Russian intelligence of eavesdropping on and then leaking a recording of a conversation between two senior U.S. officials in Kyiv that led to great embarrassment and strains between the U.S. and its European allies.\n\nIn that recording, then-Assistant Secretary of State for European Affairs Victoria Nuland is heard telling former U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine Geoff Pyatt \"F-ck the EU,\" because of the European Union's slowness to respond to the political crisis in the country.\n\n\"That phone call was also a mistake the way it was conducted and it had huge implications for our foreign policy,\" said Michael McFaul, a former U.S. ambassador to Russia who is now at Stanford University. \"Particularly after that, anybody should understand how dangerous it is to make an unsecured call in Kyiv, or anywhere else for that matter.\"\n\n\"Obviously, making a phone call from Kyiv to the president of the United States means that not just the Russian intelligence services will be on the call, but a whole lot of other people, too,\" McFaul said. \"If it was that important, he (Sondland) could have easily gotten up from the restaurant, gone to the embassy and made a secure call through the White House operations center. A lower-level official would probably be reprimanded for this kind of breach.\""

        "text": "The House on Wednesday [convened its first](https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/trump-impeachment-hearings-quid-pro-quo-trumps-defense/story?id=66944239) impeachment hearing in more than 20 years. Testifying was William Taylor, the top U.S. diplomat in [Ukraine](https://abcnews.go.com/alerts/ukraine), and George Kent, the State Department's top career official [tasked with Ukraine policy](https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/trump-impeachment-inquiry-testified-congress/story?id=66763043).\n\nHere are the key takeaways:\n\n**New details involving another Trump phone call**\n\nMuch of [Wednesday's testimony](https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/impeachment-process-works/story?id=51202880) recounted details already provided in closed-door depositions. But there was [one new detail](https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/impeachment-showdown-takes-center-stage-public-hearing/story?id=66948256) that raised fresh questions about the extent to which President [Donald Trump](https://abcnews.go.com/alerts/donald-trump) was personally involved in the pressure campaign against Ukraine.\n\nAccording to Taylor, one of his staffers was in a restaurant in Kyiv with Gordon Sondland following a meeting with Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskiy when he overheard a call between Sondland and Trump, in which Trump asked Sondland the status of \"the investigations.\" Sondland is a close Trump ally and megadonor who is serving as U.S. ambassador to the European Union.\n\nThe alleged phone call took place on July 26, one day after Trump's phone call to Zelenskiy in which he asked Ukraine's leader for an investigation involving Democrat Joe Biden.\n\n\"The member of my staff could hear President Trump on the phone, asking Ambassador Sondland about 'the investigations,'\" Taylor said. \"Ambassador Sondland told President Trump that the Ukrainians were ready to move forward.\"\n\nFollowing that call with Trump, the staffer asked Sondland what the president thought about Ukraine, according to Taylor. \"Ambassador Sondland responded that President Trump cares more about the investigations of Biden,\" which Trump's personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani had been \"pressing for,\" Taylor said.\n\nWhen questioned about it at a White House news conference with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, close to the end of the hearing, Trump said he has no recollection of the phone call with Sondland in question.\n\n**It's still a question as to when exactly Ukraine figured out military aid was frozen**\n\nThis is a key point for Republicans, who contend that Trump can't be accused of personally imposing a \"quid pro quo\" in his July 25 phone call because, they say, Ukraine had no idea that military aid was on hold at that time.\n\nThe hold was reported by Politico on Aug. 28, and Sondland has previously testified that he told Ukraine directly on Sept. 1 that security assistance was contingent upon its willingness to conduct an investigation.\n\nBy that point though, the military assistance had been frozen for several weeks and aides within the Trump administration were scrambling to figure out why. Taylor testified on Wednesday that it was already clear to him by that point that a White House summit was contingent upon Ukraine's willingness to agree to an investigation.\n\nTaylor said he personally didn't hear from his Ukrainian counterparts expressing concern about the aid until after the Politico article published. Other witnesses testified in separate closed-door hearings that their Ukrainian counterparts had figured it out earlier than that. The State Department's Catherine Croft couldn't give an exact date the Ukrainians found out, other than it was \"earlier than I expected them to.\"\n\n\"I think there's still some question as to when they may have heard,\" Taylor said.\n\n**Dems say military aid to Ukraine was released 48 hours after whistleblower complaint given to Congress**\n\nRep. Adam Schiff, the Democratic chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, said military aid to Ukraine was released 48 hours after the White House learned that Congress was informed of a whistleblower complaint involving President Donald Trump.\n\nSchiff said his committee was informed Sept. 9 by the intelligence community's inspector general that a whistleblower complaint had been filed. At that point, the director of national intelligence hadn't provided the complaint to Congress.\n\n\"On Sept. 9, when the Inspector General informed Congress that that complaint had been withheld, the White House also learned that Congress now inevitably would learn about the complaint,\" Schiff said. \"It was less than 48 hours later that the military aid would be released.\"\n\nRepublicans contend there is no clear evidence that Trump personally forced a \"quid pro quo\" on Ukraine -- $400 million in security assistance in exchange for launching an investigation that includes Democrat Joe Biden \u2013 because Ukraine eventually received the money without the public announcement the president wanted.\n\nSchiff's comments suggest the money might have remained frozen, despite objections from Pentagon and State Department officials, had Congress not found out about the whistleblower complaint.\n\nActing White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney, who ordered the hold, has refused to testify. He said in an October statement that the money was withheld \"because of concern about lack of support from other nations and concerns over corruption.\"\n\nRep. Lee Zeldin, R-N.Y., also said the White House was approaching a deadline with the end of the budget year, on Sept. 30, and that there were legal requirements that ensured the president had to validate that there were efforts to root out corruption.\n\n\"They had to get it done when they did,\" Zeldin said.\n\n\"We wanted to make sure that as Zelenskiy came in, that he was taking the steps, as he got elected on a platform to root our corruption,\" he added.\n\n**The witnesses played it straight**\n\nSeasoned diplomats, Taylor and Kent have decades of experience walking a fine line when trying to make their point. So it's probably no surprise that neither took the bait when Republicans or Democrats tried to drag them into politics.\n\nBut there were some interesting moments, including when Ohio Republican Rep. Jim Jordan told Taylor he wasn't much of a \"star witness\" because most of Taylor's information was second-hand.\n\nUpon hearing this, Taylor responded, \"I don't consider myself a star witness,\" and added, \"I'm not here to take one side or the other.\"\n\nTaylor and Kent also refused to comment when asked by Rep. John Ratcliffe, R-Texas, whether Trump's July 25 phone call with Ukraine's president constitutes an impeachable offense.\n\n\"That is not what either of us are here to do,\" Taylor said. \"This is your job.\"\n\nAt one point, Democratic Rep. Joaquin Castro tried to make the point that Trump shouldn't be let off the hook because military aid to Ukraine was eventually released by White House. Castro, D-Texas, asked the witnesses if attempted murder and robbery is a crime.\n\n\"I think that's right. I will go out on a limb and say yes, it is,\" Taylor said, with a slight smile.\n\nCastro pressed, \"Is attempted extortion a bribery or a crime?\"\n\nTaylor answered, \"I don't know, sir.\"\n\n**GOP wants first-hand knowledge, but not Trump's**\n\nRepublicans repeatedly questioned the witnesses' ability to speak on events because they lacked firsthand knowledge.\n\n\"I mean, I've seen church prayer chains that are easier to understand than this,\" Jordan exclaimed during the hearing.\n\nAsked Rep. Mike Turner, R-Ohio, of Taylor's account, \"But since you learned it from others, you could be wrong. Correct?\"\n\n\"I am telling you what I heard them tell me,\" Taylor replied. \"I've told you what I heard.\"\n\nDemocrats dismissed the GOP complaints and said much of the witness testimony obtained by Congress corroborates the initial concerns raised by the intelligence community whistleblower. They also plan to call Sondland, who spoke directly to the president, to testify in public.\n\n\"The facts in the present inquiry are not seriously contested,\" said Schiff.\n\nDemocrats also noted that the White House has blocked other key players with relevant firsthand knowledge of events from cooperating with their inquiry, including former national security adviser John Bolton, and Mulvaney.\n\nAnd as Republicans demanded that the whistleblower -- who Jordan referred to as \"the guy who started it all\" -- step up to testify, Rep. Peter Welch, D-Vt., offered another suggestion for a witness with firsthand knowledge of the events. \n\n\"I'd be glad to have the person who started it all come in and testify,\" Welch said. \"President Trump is welcome to take a seat right there.\""

        "text": "Rep. Bill Huizenga, R-Zeeland, is facing a House Ethics Committee review of a report that questions whether he improperly converted campaign funds to personal use and accepted prohibited contributions from his staff.\n\nIn a statement Friday, Huizenga's spokesman, Brian Patrick, called the accusations a \"false narrative created by the Michigan Democratic Party\" and said the congressman \"eagerly\" awaits a final resolution to questions first raised more than a year ago.\n\nOn Thursday, the Ethics Committee said it would review [the report from the independent Office of Congressional Ethics (OCE)](https://ethics.house.gov/sites/ethics.house.gov/files/OCE Review No. 19-2187_Referral.pdf), which said there was \"substantial reason\" to believe that Huizenga may have run afoul of federal law and House rules.\n\nAt issue are thousands of dollars in campaign funds spent by Huizenga's campaign over several years to pay for the congressman and his family and members of his congressional staff and their families to take trips to Disney World, Park City in Utah, and the Mackinac Republican Leadership Conference on Mackinac Island. Huizenga has argued that all of those trips were campaign-related, with fundraisers and other campaign activities involved, even though in some cases, he raised less money than the cost of the trips. \n\nHe also said that the staff he took along were also either paid or volunteer staffers to his campaign, justifying their attendance. And while laws prohibit using campaign funds for personal use in most cases, candidates typically have wide latitude in using their funds for fundraisers and other campaign purposes.\n\nThe OCE report also raised questions about tens of thousands of dollars in campaign reimbursements to Huizenga's congressional staff \u2014 including more than $33,000 to his chief of staff over three years \u2014 that lacked verifiable documentation. \n\nOCE didn't specifically fault Huizenga with the reimbursements, however. It noted that any campaign expense incurred by congressional staff other than meals and travel expenses \u2014 even if reimbursed \u2014 could qualify as contributions by them to the campaign. And congressional staffers are prohibited from making contributions to the campaigns of the members of Congress who employ them.\n\nQuestions were also raised about a dinner Huizenga had at a Grand Rapids restaurant with his brother that was paid for out of campaign funds. \"Taking the trips, combined with the campaign funds spent on the personal, family dinner at Osteria Rossa, there appears to be a pattern of disregard for, or lack of understanding of, the rules prohibiting the use of campaign funds for personal use,\" the report said. \n\nHuizenga's staff noted that these questions were raised before, in a complaint to the Federal Election Commission, [which deadlocked on them and closed the matter](https://www.fec.gov/data/legal/matter-under-review/7534/). \n\nIn its release Thursday, the House Ethics Committee noted that a review of a report does not necessarily mean any violation has occurred. If there is a violation, the committee can recommend fines or other punishment, including censure or reprimand, though that occurs infrequently."

        "text": "Rhode Island's municipal leaders on Tuesday filed a legal challenge in Superior Court to the new \"financially irresponsible lifetime contracts law'' that Gov. Gina Raimondo signed at the behest of the state's public employee unions last spring.\n\nIn their lawsuit, the mayors and town managers contend the new law extending union contracts indefinitely after they have expired violates both the contracts clause and Home Rule provision of the state Constitution, which grants cities and towns the authority to decide local matters.\n\n\"In other words, a municipality would be forced to honor all previous contract terms for possibly a year or longer, spend taxpayer dollars on legal fees for mediation and arbitration, and still lack leverage at the end of the process to gain concessions on wages and benefits,'' they argued in the suit that former Providence Mayor Angel Taveras, a lawyer, filed on their behalf against House Speaker Nicholas Mattiello, Senate President Dominick Ruggerio and Raimondo.\n\nOne after another, the mayors and town managers standing side by side at a news conference at North Providence Town Hall said the new law also creates an \"imaginary finish line to all of our labor contracts'' that removes any incentive for unions to negotiate concessions.\n\n\"As the costs of health care, pensions and retiree benefits keep rising, taxpayers will get crushed if local leaders can't renegotiate those benefits,'' Cranston Mayor Allan Fung said. \n\n\"Wages and benefits represent 70% of city and school budgets and most of [the] associated costs, whether it's health care, pensions ... continue to rise at alarming rates and the grandparents on fixed incomes and widows just barely scraping by cannot take the tax collectors coming back for more,'' Fung said.\n\n\"We're here to tell you ... enough is enough,'' he said.\n\n\"All we are asking for is to be at the dining room table, in the dining room, and not out in the back yard in the shed,'' added North Providence Mayor Charles Lombardi.\n\nIn a joint statement, Mattiello and Ruggerio said: \"We're disappointed that some local leaders have chosen to take the unusual step of suing the General Assembly and the Governor. We are confident the law enacted to protect our municipal employees and teachers will withstand this legal challenge.\"\n\n\"This law requires all municipal leaders to come to the negotiating table in good faith. It protects wages and benefits when a contract has expired so that these employees can continue to serve their communities and our children. This law, which had been standard practice for many years, is fair to both sides and creates a level playing field for all parties,'' they said.\n\nRaimondo's office said she had not had a chance to review the newly filed lawsuit, but she believes \"the legislation passed by the General Assembly last session was narrowly tailored to return to what was the status quo for decades in Rhode Island'' \u2014 before a 2009 court decision in an East Providence case \u2014 \"and we're confident it will stand.\"\n\nBut Brian Daniels, executive director of the Rhode Island League of Cites and Towns, pushed back, saying: \"The status quo was that mayors and town managers negotiated their own local contracts \u2014 not the state.\"\n\nThe communities filing the suit include Barrington, Bristol, Burrillville, Central Falls, Charlestown, Cranston, East Greenwich, Lincoln, Little Compton, North Kingstown, North Providence, North Smithfield, Pawtucket, Providence, Smithfield and Woonsocket.\n\nJohnston Mayor Joseph Polisena told WPRO he did not sign on because the other cities and towns did not back his town's legal fight for street light reimbursements.\n\nWarwick Mayor Joseph Solomon told The Journal: \"At this time, I don't believe that litigation is the answer. ... I believe we can get more accomplished by having open discussions about potential amendments ... [such as] an amendment that provides some alternative means for the contract to expire after a reasonable period of time that is fair and balanced to both the employees and the taxpayers.\"\n\nThe unions that pushed for more than a decade for the continuing-contracts law said it was aimed at preventing cities and towns from ever again unilaterally cutting pay, increasing health-care contributions and imposing what they view as disruptive work shifts on public employees, as happened in a handful of communities during past contract disputes.\n\nSenate co-sponsor Valarie Lawson, the paid vice president of the National Education Association of Rhode Island, told colleagues last spring: \"We can make sure no other community in Rhode Island faces what we faced in East Providence,'' including a unilateral salary cut and a stepped up co-share for health coverage during a bitter contract war a decade ago. (The state Ethics Commission subsequently ruled she had no conflict of interest.) \n\nIn 2017, Raimondo vetoed an earlier version of the bill, saying: \"Current Rhode Island law protects the taxpayers from being obligated indefinitely for contract provisions that, in the future, may not be affordable.\n\n\"The proposed legislation before me extinguishes this existing protection, hurting the public's position in contract negotiations, and placing taxpayers at risk of being forever locked into contractual provisions they can no longer afford,'' she said then. \"The likely result would be higher property taxes.\"\n\nIn a statement explaining her turnaround last spring, Raimondo said the earlier continuing-contracts bill \"went too far in automatically extending all provisions in collective bargaining agreements for municipal employees and teachers until a successor agreement has been reached.\"\n\nThe version she opted to sign only locks in wages and benefits, she said.\n\nRaimondo's shift came after she won the endorsement of the National Education Association of Rhode Island and other unions in her 2018 reelection bid.

        "text": "Ambassador William Taylor named Kurt Volker, the former head of Arizona State University's McCain Institute who was a special envoy to Ukraine, as part of an \"irregular\" channel in diplomatic relations with that country.\n\nTaylor testified Wednesday, part of the first day of public hearings in the impeachment inquiry into President Donald Trump's dealings with Ukraine, that Volker and others worked closely outside of the conventional diplomatic methods, an area that has come under scrutiny.\n\nTaylor, a diplomat who has worked with every president since Ronald Reagan, effectively headed the U.S. embassy in Ukraine since the spring, when Secretary of State Mike Pompeo persuaded him to return to government service.\n\n\"I encountered an irregular, informal channel of U.S. policymaking with respect to Ukraine ?unaccountable to Congress ?a channel that included then-Special Envoy Kurt Volker, U.S. Ambassador to the European Union Gordon Sondland, Secretary of Energy Rick Perry, White House Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney, and, as I subsequently learned, (Trump's lawyer Rudy) Giuliani,\" Taylor said.\n\n\"I was clearly in the regular channel, but I was also in the irregular one to the extent that ambassadors Volker and Sondland included me in certain conversations. Although this irregular channel was well-connected in Washington, it operated mostly outside of official State Department channels.\"\n\n\nTaylor's testimony returned focus on those channels of communication, whose purpose are at the heart of the impeachment proceedings. \n\nIn his own closed-door testimony, which was released last week, Volker said he worked to advance U.S. foreign policy interests while trying to balance the demands from the White House and Giuliani.\n\nVolker is scheduled to testify publicly next week.\n\nFOR SUBSCRIBERS:What we know about ex-McCain Institute boss Kurt Volker\n\nTaylor said Wednesday though that Volker and Sondland both told him that Trump treated Ukraine as a businessman expecting a check from a customer who had not yet paid for merchandise.\n\n\"During our call on Sept. 8, Ambassador Sondland tried to explain to me that President Trump is a businessman. When a businessman is about to sign a check to someone who owes him something, the businessman asks that person to pay up before signing the check,\" Taylor said.\n\n\"Ambassador Volker used the same language several days later while we were together at the Yalta European Strategy Conference. I argued to both that the explanation made no sense: the Ukrainians did not 'owe' President Trump anything, and holding up security assistance for domestic political gain was crazy, as I had said in my text message to Ambassadors Sondland and Volker on Sept. 9.\"\n\n\nVolker testified that he was \"surprised\" when he eventually learned about the content of the July 25 telephone conversation between Trump and new Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky. According to notes of that call, Trump asked Zelensky for \"a favor\" that included investigating Democratic political rival Joe Biden and his son.\n\nVolker also said he never got an explanation as to why $391 million in military aid to Ukraine was delayed.\n\nVolker said he worried Giuliani was spreading already-disproven narratives about Ukraine to Trump, complicating relations with the nations, just as Ukraine had elected Zelensky.\n\nEven so, Volker acknowledged encouraging Ukrainian officials to address the concerns that Trump had expressed through Giuliani.\n\nOn Aug. 13, Volker was inspecting the proposed language of a Ukrainian statement announcing an investigation of interference in U.S. politics.\n\nIn a text message, Volker asked that the statement include \"2 key items.\" The investigation should include \"Burisma and the 2016 U.S. elections,\" Volker said.\n\nVolker stepped down from his unpaid envoy post in September ahead of his closed-door testimony to the House Intelligence Committee. Shortly afterward, he also quit as executive director of ASU's McCain Institute for International Leadership, which he had headed since its 2012 founding.\n\nCindy McCain, the widow of the late Sen. John McCain, asked Volker to resign, saying his involvement in the impeachment inquiry was \"overshadowing\" the think tank's work.\n\nVolker said Ukrainians asked to be connected to Giuliani \u8965n order to try to get across their message of being different from the past.?By speaking to Giuliani, Ukrainian officials thought their messages would reach Trump."

        "title": "After Today, the Vise Tightens on Trump's Ukraine Point Man",
        "text": "Republicans' most fruitful line of attack during the first day of congressional impeachment hearings for Donald Trump has put even more pressure on a forthcoming witness who has flailed under it thus far: donor-turned ambassador Gordon Sondland. \n\nAs two senior State Department officials spent nearly six hours recounting their alarm with an effort by Trump's allies that they said undermined U.S. national interests in favor of promoting the president's re-election, Republicans on the House Intelligence Committee repeatedly pointed out that neither witness had interacted with Trump or key deputies like White House Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney or personal attorney Rudy Giuliani. \n\nBut a critical future witness had: Sondland, the U.S. ambassador to the European Union. Sondland, however, has reversed himself on central aspects of his participation in a shadow foreign policy effort\u2014reversals that have put Trump in a worse position. And he testifies, publicly, next Wednesday. \n\nHis appearance gained more importance on Wednesday after Ambassador Bill Taylor revealed new details about a July 26 phone call between the president and Sondland, overheard by a Taylor staffer in Kyiv. Taylor told legislators that one of his staffers was at dinner with Sondland when Trump called. During the call, the staffer relayed to Taylor, Trump himself instructed Sondland to press the Ukrainians on delivering \"the investigations.\" The call came one day after Trump's fateful phone call with Zelensky in which the U.S. president asked for \"a favor.\" \n\nSondland, Taylor recounted, said the Ukranians were ready to \"move forward.\" When the call ended, the Taylor staffer asked what Trump thought of Ukraine\u2014to which Sondland replied that the president \"cares more about the investigations of Biden.\" \n\nSondland's omission of that important detail in his Oct. 17 deposition\u2014which was later amended to clarify his impression of a Trump quid pro quo\u2014only adds to Democrats' desire to cross-examine him. Aides and lawmakers predicted the ambassador would face withering questioning, probably from both sides.\n\n\"He should be able to tell us the contents of that conversation,\" said Rep. Joaquin Castro (D-TX), a member of the House Intelligence Committee. \"And he should tell us the truth. He owes us the truth, but more than that, he owes the American people the truth.\"\n\nSondland's lawyer declined to comment. \n\nThroughout the summer of 2019, Sondland, who had described himself as Trump's point person on Ukraine, had on several occasions described by numerous witnesses pressed aides to Ukrainian President Volodomyr Zelensky to commit, publicly, to investigating a gas firm tied to Trump political adversary Joe Biden and a conspiracy theory that Ukraine and not Russia interfered in the 2016 election.\n\nSondland, in a now-famous text message to Taylor, one of the two witnesses before the House on Wednesday, initially insisted the administration was not conditioning the release of $400 million in frozen U.S. military aid\u2014as well as the prospect of a coveted White House meeting for Zelensky\u2014on investigating Trump's political enemies. But after the House intelligence, foreign affairs and oversight committees began investigating Sondland's role, the hotel magnate and novice diplomat admitted that he told the Ukrainians \"resumption of the U.S. aid would likely not occur until Ukraine provided the public anticorruption statement that we had been discussing.\"\n\nTaylor, who dissented from Sondland's efforts\u2014which were aided by Giuliani, ex-Ukraine special envoy Kurt Volker, Mulvaney and Energy Secretary Rick Perry\u2014put Sondland under additional pressure during the first day of hearings.\n\nAdditionally, in a deposition last month, Taylor said that Sondland told him on a Sept. 8 phone call that the diplomat, then alarmed about the frozen military aid, needed to understand that Trump is a businessman. \"When a businessman is about to sign a check to someone who owes him something, he said, the businessman asks that person to pay up before signing the check,\" Taylor quoted Sondland as saying.\n\nSondland, in his depositions to the impeachment inquiry, had said he couldn't recall many pivotal details about what Taylor had called a \"highly irregular\" channel at cross-purposes with official U.S. policy on assisting Ukraine. As October wore on, that became a tenuous position for Sondland\u2014who had never before faced sustained congressional scrutiny\u2014as multiple witnesses described their interactions with Sondland in detail, in some cases providing text messages and emails.  \n\nVolker, who with Sondland and Perry made up the \"three amigos\" of the shadow diplomatic channel, will testify publicly on Tuesday. \n\nIronically, Giuliani, the president's personal lawyer who remains at the center of the Trump-Ukraine scandal, had previously downplayed Sondland's role in the shadow campaign to influence the Ukrainian government. \n\nIn September, the former New York City mayor revealed to The Daily Beast that Sondland was indeed one of the diplomats who he had briefed on his progress, but insisted that Sondland was hardly the \"main one,\" and that they'd only spoken on a couple of conference calls. In fact, Giuliani had claimed that the first time he spoke to Sondland was a surprise\u2014that he had patched himself into a call to discuss Ukraine matters and unexpectedly found that Sondland was also on the line and getting roped into the scheme.\n\nStill, Sondland's perceived closeness with the president and Ukraine could be further emphasized on Friday when former U.S. ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch is slated to testify to the committee. In her deposition last month, Yovanovitch said she sought Sondland's advice when it became clear she was being targeted by Giuliani and his associations. According to Yovanovitch, Sondland advised her to \"tweet out there that you support the President, and that all these are lies and everything else.\" \n\nAs Taylor and Deputy Assistant Secretary of State George Kent testified, Republicans attacked their credibility. Ranking Intelligence Committee Republican Devin Nunes (R-CA) went the furthest, calling them \"remarkably uninformed\" about statements made by now-former Ukranian officials in 2016 deriding Trump. (Nunes implied that meant the Ukranians interfered in the election, something U.S. intelligence agencies, who assessed Russian interference instead, have never credited.) Rep. Jim Jordan (R-OH) told Taylor he was \"wrong\" to understand U.S. security assistance and the White House visit were conditioned on Ukraine delivering the investigations, since Trump ultimately released the aid on Sept. 11\u2014although that was after Congress learned that a whistleblower had raised alarm over the Trump-Zelensky phone call. \n\nTaylor's source for his understanding, he shot back to Jordan, was Gordon Sondland.\n\nRep. Tom Malinowski (D-NJ), who sits on the House Foreign Affairs Committee, said the Taylor's information about the call showed how close Sondland was to the operation. \n\n\"I think it's all the more clear that Sondland was doing everything in coordination with the president and the president saw Sondland as the instrument of his policy of getting these investigations from the Ukrainians,\" he said.  \n\nAfter the hearing, Trump's team emphasized that Kent and Taylor were irrelevant witnesses who were never in the loop with the president and attacked them as \"bureaucrats\" who were shanking the president for disagreeing with them on policy. \n\n\"Today we heard from Democrats' hand-picked star witnesses, who together were not on the Ukraine phone call, did not speak directly to President Trump, got third-hand hearsay from one side of a different phone call in a restaurant, and formed opinions based on stories in the pages of the New York Times,\" Trump campaign manager Brad Parscale said in a statement.  \"We hate to break it to these unelected, career government bureaucrats who think they know best: the President of the United States sets foreign policy, not them.\" \n\nThroughout the impeachment inquiry's big day, numerous Trumpworld figures and top administration officials\u2014including the president\u2014used their social media accounts as tools of rapid-response and insta-rebuttal against the Democratic inquisitors. Senior officials on the Trump reelection campaign, such as National Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany, quickly clipped and quoted in real time their GOP allies on Capitol Hill who were grilling the witnesses, in wall-to-wall denunciation of \"the Democrat lies.\"\n\n\"Do you not stand with [President] Trump in the Fake Impeachment Hoax? He needs you in this fight, friend,\" the 2020 Trump campaign texted to supporters as the hearing wrapped. \"Donate for a DOUBLE-MATCH NOW,\" the message added, as campaign brass aggressively fundraised off of Trump's impeachment woes on Wednesday.\n\nThe president, for his part, made a perhaps futile attempt to counter-program the public hearing\u2014by hosting GOP senators and Turkish strongman Recep Tayyip Erdogan in the Oval Office for an awkward make-up session.\n\nShortly after both the Oval summit and the Hill hearing had concluded, Trump and Erdogan held a joint press conference at the White House, during which the pair traded words of flattery and discussed the Middle East and relations between their two countries. President Trump, of course, made time to riff on Wednesday's \"witch hunt\" that he said should never have been allowed to proceed. He reiterated his desire to have the anonymous whistleblower outed, and called the public hearing a \"joke.\" Trump also noted that it was a shame they had to \"waste this gentleman's time\"\u2014meaning his friend Erdogan\u2014talking about it.\n\nIt wasn't long before Sondland was brought up there, as well. \n\nAsked by a reporter about the story Taylor relayed from his aide during testimony, Trump denied knowing anything about it. \n\n\"I know nothing about that, first time that I heard it,\" he said. \"The one thing I've seen is that Sondland said was that he did speak to me for a brief moment. I said no quid pro quo under any circumstances. And that's true. I never heard this.\" \n\nHe added, \"In any event, it is more secondhand information, but I've never heard it.\"\n\nAdditional reporting Erin Banco, Betsy Swan "

        "text": "With absentee voting skyrocketing since voters approved a ballot proposal  last year allowing for its expansion, clerks across the state are worrying about counting ballots next year, when a record turnout is expected for the presidential race.\n\nSome clerks and Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson are calling on the state to allow election officials to be able to open and prepare absentee ballots for counting \u2014 and maybe even begin tabulating \u2014 votes before Election Day.\n\nOpponents worry that early processing and counting could lead to more voter fraud because ballots could be less secure until they're ready to be counted. They're also concerned that results could leak out and have a chilling effect on voters who haven't cast ballots yet.\n\nIn the August primary and November general election, when city leadership races and police and parks millages were at stake, absentee voting in some communities was as high as 82%. Hot races drew a record number of absentee voters: \n\nIn Warren,  51.2% of the votes came from absentee voters, who provided the winning margin for Mayor Jim Fouts' reelection last week. \nIn Westland, where seven candidates were vying for four City Council seats, 67% of the voters cast absentee ballots last week. \nIn Rochester Hills, where six people were running for two seats on the City Council, 82% of voters chose the absentee route during the August primary. \nThirty other states and Washington D.C. have rules and laws in place that allow for election officials to at least begin processing absentee ballots and, in some cases, counting the votes, before Election Day. This eases the load on Election Day and allows for quicker release of results after the polls close.\n\nUnder Michigan law, election officials aren't allowed to process or count ballots until Election Day.\n\nLocal clerks seeing big changes in voting habits\nLocal clerks began seeing the impact of Proposal 3, allowing anyone to vote by absentee ballot, in the first election of the year in May.\n\nBut the August primary and the November 5 election results confirmed their suspicion that elections in Michigan have changed forever.\n\n\"In August, 82% of the ballots we issued were voted by absentee,\" said Rochester Hills city clerk Tina Barton. \"On Tuesday (Nov. 5), more than 50% were absentee and I'm anticipating in March (for the presidential primary), we'll be back to the higher number.\"\n\nIn statewide November elections in 2014, 2016 and 2018, absentee voting rates ranged from 25.4% to 26.5%. While the state doesn't keep a tally in municipal elections, cities across the state reported absentee vote totals from last week's election at 50% or higher. \n\nMore:Voters in 7 Michigan cities opt to keep marijuana businesses out\n\nMore:Detroit Institute of Arts proves critics right, asks for millage renewal after vow not to\n\nCoupled with a new provision that allows people to register to vote, and cast ballots, up through Election Day, clerks are worried about how to cope with the more labor-intensive duties on Election Day.\n\nIn Warren, where a highly contested race for mayor attracted a higher than normal turnout, 51.2% cast absentee ballots. \n\n\"Our permanent absentee voter list went from 12,000 to 21,000 people and that number could double for the presidential election next year,\" Warren city clerk Sonja Buffa said.\n\nWarren election workers began counting the absentee ballots at 8 a.m. and didn't finish until 11 p.m.  It's a labor intensive process that requires ballots to be removed from envelopes, unfolded, flattened and fed through a ballot tabulator.\n\n\"I think it will eventually even out and I'll need less people at the polls and more at AV board,\" Buffa said. \"But for now, I like to have six people at each of the precincts and at least 50 people counting absentee ballots.\"\n\nIn Westland, 67% of the 8,638 voters who cast ballots chose the absentee route. And that wasn't a surprise for Clerk Richard LeBlanc.\n\n\"One of the things that I did when I first was elected was an outreach effort because we had 11,000 people over 60 who weren't permanent absentee voters,\" he said. \"We went from slightly over 4,000 on our permanent AV list to 11,000. So, we've had the benefit of a couple of years of a higher volume.\"\n\nAnd 2020 is only going to be bigger. The last four presidential cycles have recorded turnouts of at least 63% in Michigan.\n\n\"While we don't make specific predictions, we're expecting a surge in turnout next year, because a lot of people are watching and are excited about this coming election,\" said Myrna Perez, the director of Voting Rights and Elections at the Brennan Center for Justice, a New York-based organization that advocates, in part, for equal and fair access to voting. \"We're telling election workers they need to be prepared.\"\n\nMichiganders wanted easier access to the polls\nThe surge in absentee voting comes after Michigan voters overwhelmingly passed a ballot proposal in 2018 that expanded access to voting in several ways. The proposal:\n\nAllowed all voters to vote by absentee ballot without having to provide an excuse. Previously, voters had to use one of six reasons to be eligible for absentee ballots \u2014 60 or older, out of town on Election Day, being a poll worker, being unable to vote without assistance at the polls, in jail awaiting arraignment or trial; unable to vote in person because of religious reasons;\nAllowed voters to register to vote, and cast ballots, up through Election Day. Before Proposal 3, people couldn't register to vote in the 30 days before an election.\nRestored straight-ticket voting, which allows voters to fill in one box on the ballot to vote for all Republicans or Democrats.\nThe sentiment behind the \"Promote the Vote\" ballot proposal was to make it easier for people to cast ballots and to perhaps increase participation in elections.\n\nTurnout this month was up slightly in Wayne and Macomb counties compared with the comparable election four years ago, but down slightly in Oakland County.\n\nMacomb County Clerk Fred Miller can't say yet whether the increase in absentee voting was a factor for the turnout uptick.\n\n\"We had a couple of really high-interest races in some communities,\" he said, pointing to the Warren mayor's race and millages in Washington Township. \"I think it will take a couple of election cycles to figure it out.\"\n\nCharles Stewart III, who runs the election data and science lab at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology said there's little evidence that easier access to absentee voting increases turnout in big election years, such as the 2016 or upcoming 2020 presidential elections.\n\n\"Where it does increase turnout is for elections of lower interest, like school board elections, bond issues or municipal elections,\" he said. \"Those are areas where, when you have a permanent absentee voter list, you can double turnout in those elections pretty easily.\"\n\nClerks say proposals for help not adequate\nLawmakers are looking at ways to ease the burden on local clerks. Bills have been introduced that would mandate local clerks create permanent absentee voter lists that would be used to mail out applications for absentee ballots. \n\nThe bills also would make it easier to consolidate precincts as more people choose the absentee voting route and allow clerks to use more unconventional locations for polling precincts, since some locations such as schools are no longer allowing elections officials to use their buildings for precincts.\n\nBut that's not nearly enough for many clerks who have to balance the need for maintaining the integrity of the election with reporting results in a timely manner.\n\nClinton Township Clerk Kim Meltzer told lawmakers last month that 16,000 voters cast absentee ballots in the August election and it took her election workers until 2:30 a.m. to get those ballots counted.\n\n\"And now we're anticipating even more of an increase in 2020,\" she said. \"Even if it's just three hours more, that's taking us to 5 a.m. and it's mostly older people processing the ballots.\n\n\"With sleep deprivation, mistakes are more likely at that point,\" she added. \"We want to provide quick results, but not at the expense of the integrity of the process.\"\n\nSome clerks are calling on the state to allow election officials to be able to at least open and prepare absentee ballots for counting before Election Day.\n\nBarton takes it a step further and said that clerks should be allowed to run absentee ballots through voting tabulators before Election Day, making sure that no vote totals are tallied until the polls close at 8 p.m. on election night.\n\n\"We can start counting early, putting ballots through tabulators. Or Virginia has a preparation process, getting the ballots in stacks and ready to go, but not tabulated,\" she said. \"It's like chopping all the vegetables the night before for Thanksgiving dinner.\"\n\nOther states are doing it. Oregon is one of three states \u2014 the others are Washington and Colorado \u2014 that does all of its voting by mail and begins running ballots through tabulators before Election Day.\n\nMichigan was the latest state to allow for no-reason absentee voting, joining 30 other states that let voters fill out and turn in their ballots before Election Day. Another 19 states require a specific excuse for absentee voting.\n\nSome clerks and lawmakers are skeptical of early voting, though, and are concerned that results might leak out before all voters cast their ballots.\n\n\"I'm not totally comfortable with the idea of counting ahead of time,\" said Macomb's Miller, noting it's a decision that local clerks will have to make. \"I'd be afraid that there would be unintended, maybe chilling consequences.\"\n\nSen. Ruth Johnson, R-Holly, is the former Secretary of State and said that because 1,520 city and township local clerks run elections in Michigan, instead of the 83 county clerks, there is too much room for error.\n\n\"The biggest concern is how do you sequester and keep the integrity of those ballots,\" she said. \"We have had people, clerks that have fiddled with ballots and they were caught,\"\n\nBut Stewart said there are ways of managing those concerns.\n\n\"You can make a distinction between getting ready to scan and actually scanning the ballots. There are ways of opening envelopes and putting them in secure batches and coming back on Election Day,\" he said. \"And the fact is that there are administrative controls for early voting, so the results aren't leaking out ahead of time.\"\n\nIt's a system that Benson also has endorsed. She told lawmakers earlier this year that she wants clerks to be able to start counting ballots four days before Election Day. \n\n\"This will help ensure they are able to provide accurate election results as soon as possible following the close of polls on Election Day itself, while reducing the possibility for counting errors that occur when you're trying to count a significant number of ballots in a short period of time,\" she told the House Elections and Ethics committee.\n\nThe surge in absentee voters remains one of Benson's biggest concerns about the 2020 election and beyond, she told a Senate Elections panel on Oct. 30. \n\n\"Citizens are going to be voting by mail in increasing numbers more than ever before and we need to be prepared for it,\" she said. \"If you educate voters and give them the opportunity to vote by mail, they will take advantage of that.\"\n\nIn the meantime, some clerks are using advanced technology to speed the process of counting absentee ballot. Many communities are using high-speed tabulators to more efficiently count ballots and Westland's LeBlanc has an envelope-opening machine that also cuts down the time it takes to get ballots counted.\n\nRight to register and vote on Election Day causing headaches, too\nVoters also are taking the advantage of new law to register to vote in the month before an election.\n\nIn last week's election, more than 2,000 people registered to vote in the 14 days before the election, including 1,000 who registered and voted on Election Day, according to preliminary figures from the Secretary of State. One-third of those registering on Election Day were 18-21 years old.\n\n\"We're optimistic that next year we'll see even more people, particularly young people, take advantage of this opportunity and our democracy will be better for it,\" Benson said.\n\nAnd that's also creating additional challenges for clerks, especially on Election Day, when most workers are tied up with running the actual election.\n\n\"We had three people register on Election Day,\" LeBlanc said. \"I knew a mother and daughter who came in and I said 'happy birthday,' to the daughter. She looked at me and said, 'It's not my birthday,' and I said it had to be her birthday if she was coming in to register on Election Day.\"\n\nBarton said there were only about four people who registered to vote in Rochester Hills on Election Day.\n\n\"But that's time-consuming, so we have to hire multiple employees for that, too,\" she said. \"Elections are kind of like Christmas \u2014 they're exciting, they're expensive. Some people are naughty, some are nice. And they're full of surprises.\"\n\nAdditional election resources are scarce\nAs with many public policy issues, much of the concern revolves on having enough resources to get the job done.\n\nBenson asked lawmakers for an additional $3 million to help with the new voting laws, including purchasing more high-speed tabulators for clerks. But lawmakers made no promises.\n\n\"Lawmakers need to better resource election administrators so they can handle these voting surges adequately,\" said Perez of the Brennan Center. \"Americans have the best democracy in the world and we don't want to pay for it. It's not cheap to run elections well.\""
